"Alantae of Chesterfeild, MI","Nov. 22, 2016",1,"I used to love Comcast. Until all these constant updates. My internet and cable crash a lot at night, and sometimes during the day, some channels don't even work and on demand sometimes don't play either. I wish they will do something about it. Because just a few mins ago, the internet have crashed for about 20 mins for no reason. I'm tired of it and thinking about switching to Wow or something. Please do not get Xfinity."
"Vera of Philadelphia, PA","Nov. 19, 2016",1,I'm so over Comcast! The worst internet provider. I'm taking online classes and multiple times was late with my assignments because of the power interruptions in my area that lead to poor quality internet service. Definitely switching to Verizon. I'd rather pay $10 extra then dealing w/ Comcast and non stopping internet problems.
"Sarah of Rancho Cordova, CA","Nov. 17, 2016",1,"If I could give them a negative star or no stars on this review I would. I have never worked with any industry with as bad of customer service as Comcast. It is not a matter of money because I make well enough above and beyond to afford their services but they are a legitimate ripoff. I think they are the biggest scam of since the mortgage industry's major meltdown and I hope I move somewhere where Comcast does not exist. The disregard to want to help or do the right thing is honestly astounding. If you have to call, which you do FOR ALL ISSUES - billing, connection/service, adding or removing service, errors, it does not matter you will be transferred minimum of 4 times. Everyone says the same thing and passes the issues to the next person and no one resolves the problem.They offer promotional packages in small timeframes and can never access them again so they then upgrade you without you wishing and change your billing. It has been 5 months and I have been overcharged $40 a month since I started with them. The blatant rudeness that must make you qualified to do this job is the type of quality service that gets you this review. So... Dear Comcast, you suck. Sincerely, a customer who cannot wait to never use your service again."
"Dennis of Manchester, NH","Nov. 16, 2016",1,"I've had the worst experiences so far since install on 10/4/16. Nothing but problems. Two no shows on scheduled service appointments, extreme difficulty in adding boxes to the second floor. What is so difficult about adding boxes to an existing account? No thank you, I'm not starting a second account for the second floor of the same house! A separate bundle package? All I wanted was just to add a few boxes. Apparently this is not possible. Well then, I guess it's not possible to remain a customer!"
"Ryan of Bellevue, WA","Nov. 14, 2016",1,"Check your contract when you sign up for Comcast as their advertised offers do not match the contract they issue. I signed up for $49.99 150Mbps internet for 2 years, however my contract has $19.99 for 25Mbps internet for 2 years. They say there is an add on in place for $30 which boost it to Blast! Pro, however this isn't part of the contract, which means that Comcast can increase the price whenever they want within the 2 years. This means I haven't received the advertised rate. Comcast has so far refused to issue corrected contract, or issue in writing that the $30 will remain at that price for 2 years. I just have to trust them. So watch out, Comcast is doing the usual illegal practices, I'm guessing to catch people out and hope they don't notice and end up paying more than they should."
"Terri of Mobile, AL","Nov. 9, 2016",1,Thank God. I am changing to Dish. They gave me awesome pricing and super people to deal with. You can actually understand what they are saying. I'm so excited to finally be able to return this equipment although still haven't received the home security yet as promised 4 times. Go to h*ll Comcast. You have made me miserable and cause me to miss many hours of work with your promises.
"Kellie of Salt Lake City, UT","Nov. 9, 2016",1,"I Have been a long time customer and only have Xfinity as my ISP for a while now. While I was in the local Walmart on November 4, 2016, there were customer representatives from Xfinity running promotions for and in the Salt Lake City area. Spoke with a representative and was able to get and signed a contract for Pro Blast at $50.00 a month with no contract or early termination fees. I received an email from Xfinity stating the changes that would be made to my account. It stated that not only would it be under contract for 24 months but there would be early termination fees. This is not what I had originally signed up for and it specifically states this on the contract that I signed. Contacted Xfinity customer service and was told since they cannot see the contract over the phone that I would need to go to Xfinity store in person. Went to Xfinity store on November 8, 2016 and was told that it would be under contract and there was no way around it. Because of this I have cancelled the upgrade and went back to my original plan. It's plain and simple. When a contract is signed it should be honored for what is stated on it. Xfinity is dishonest and not trustworthy. Therefore I will be looking and changing my ISP as soon as possible to another company. Xfinity does not deserve a paycheck from me or anyone else that I know."
"Kathleen of New Haven, CT","Nov. 6, 2016",2,"There is a malfunction on the DVR manager which is preventing us from adding more recordings. Customer service is fairly certain that the problem is from the signal from their system to ours, but protocol demands that they access our home before investigating that option. Since we work, that cannot be done until next Saturday. Customer service tech agreed that this seems illogical since logic would dictate that one would investigate the most probably malfunction first, but insists they must follow protocol. This is extremely frustrating. After 35 years as a customer of Comcast & their predecessors, I am investigating alternatives."
"Shira of Bloomfield, NJ","Nov. 5, 2016",1,Charges overwhelming. Comcast service rep was so ignorant and rude when I call to resolve my issue with my bill. I emailed Tom ** his rep was rude to me. None of the representative was helpful. They all just pass me on to other people. I am cutting my service with Comcast.
"Kristy of Alpharetta, GA","Nov. 2, 2016",1,"I have had cable, DISH, and U-verse, etc. in the past. All are eh... but you know what? Comcast takes the cake. I have never been driven to take time out of my day just to gripe online for all to see. But consumers, stay away! So my first terrible experience with Comcast is that they took 5 phones and 2 months to come out and bury the lines they had to lay in my front yard to get the cable needed into my house. Finally got someone when my special needs neighbor tripped and fell!Now 3 months into my contract, I have had my internet, phone, and TV go out for HOURS at a time. I would spend 3 hours on with a tech when it will come back up after the technician resets the router manually for the 3rd or 4th time. I have had it, I work from home occasionally and this is a huge inconvenience! The hardware is faulty, I understand that sometimes you get a lemon... but 3 months! 3 months! I have had it. Worst company ever. Crappy equipment and terrible customer service, and worse is the technicians they hire! Not a clue! Comcast should send a technician out here to switch out this equipment before I set a bonfire to it."
"Melissa of Katy, TX","Nov. 1, 2016",1,"Had them from 2014 to now. I'd tell new customers to run but there is nowhere to run to. I tried, but it turned out Comcast was Xfinity. Signing up for a contract has no meaning. The fine print in the contract that they suggest you read when they randomly change a contract says they can change anything anytime and are not doing anything wrong. I disagree. I have or had performance pro, paying for a speed of internet a month under a contract. Not month to month alone. The speed is not listed or told to you just it's between 25 and 50.I got a letter Friday saying Tue (today) I'm being forced into a new contract plan. I'm now paying for my data at the same speed with a cap of a terabyte. Seems like a lot but it's not and not what I signed up for. But all customer service says is that's the deal now. They don't offer plans by just speed it's changed. Those who use more Internet should pay more. It's not fair to the other customers. What does it matter fair it's what we signed up to use. I use firestick. We stream everything all day. It's frustrating. They kept saying it's the same, but if I use more just go to the unlimited plan for only $50 more. I don't have 150$. It's why we got rid of direcTV for firestick. Paying for an unlimited speed to being changed to pay for data is a huge difference. All they can say is, ""You won't know there was a change unless you go over 1000. The closest you got so far was 980 and we won't charge you for going over the first 2 months to get used to it."" When I first went to talk to someone at the store they didn't want to talk to me and told me I needed to call billing. They don't know about it. How can they not help or explain if we pay bills there and get equipment there. After a minute the guy called someone over who is good at explaining the letter. So now they know about the letter and someone can explain it. They just didn't want to deal with it in the store. So the other guy comes over and lies to us as well. Tells us the letter got sent to everyone but is only for new customers, not us. Whatever I know it's all a lie. We leave and today I call Comcast. As soon as you call it asks if you are calling about your data. Say yes and it directs the call to someone who only knows to say, ""Read your contract and there is nothing you can do."" They don't know anything. You need billing. Then why did it put the call to somewhere that can't help. It's the run around. The last guy I talked to is what is above. How can they be the only internet around. So I'm forced to pay by data now and I don't even get a better speed for being gypped. It's also wrong - I only got notified Friday. That Tuesday Nov 1st the change takes effect."
"Lori of Huntsville, AL","Nov. 1, 2016",1,"Disappointed. I have been a Comcast/Xfinity customer for almost two decades. I pay for high speeds and get intermittent internet. I call every week almost-- can't take the time to call more often and get FRUSTRATED. I spend 30 minutes with the first person resetting the modem (walking through their initial process - even after giving them the history) only to be told I will have to pay for a technician. After some complaining and explaining - they transfer me to a specialist who does speed tests and confirms what I am saying even though their test ""say"" the modem is working - he test each port on the modem (which is a new modem they replaced last week) and I have the same issue - tells me there is a line issue and my modem isn't performing correctly - technician reprograms the ports--retests it works awesome initially when they get it to carry more data--only to retest with the technician a few minutes later and the speed is low again. They say they need to send out a tech to look at the lines - COLD transfer me back to Xfinity without warning and when someone answers they start the process ALL OVER AGAIN - reset the modem charge me for tech - transfer me to specialist - another 3 hours wasted this week, last week - in this modern age and for $216 a month you would think you could work from home without distractions. I pay for the fastest package 115 mbps download and 25 mbps upload and receive random speeds throughout the day (between 9-80 mbps download and 2-22 mbps) upload - most often in the lower numbers with wireless monitoring showing ""dropped"" messages from my server and having to refresh pages and lose data regularly. Is there anyone out there who can help? I am attaching several speed tests from today during my calls between 10-12 a.m cst. What does a consumer do? Is there a dependable internet provider? It feels like they use their call systems to bully/frustrate the customer into submission."
"Richard of Lauderhill, FL","Oct. 31, 2016",1,"These people are unethical and disturbing oblivious to their customers needs. The internet speed tears are constantly changing and customers are being charged as the internet speeds change. For instance, when their ""blast"" service was first commissioned by me it was stated by Comcast that it was 100 Mbps. Now I see a $10.00 increase in my bill after 6 months and when speaking to a customer rep was told that it was not 100 Mbps but 75 Mbps and the blast in which I have had for 6 months plus was in fact 75 Mbps. The have added $10.00 to my bill for a service I already had. I told them to take it off and give me the 75 Mbps without the ""blast"" which I was told that it would put me to 25 Mbps. I will be shopping for another service. The end."
"Liz of Eden Prairie, MN","Oct. 31, 2016",1,"Unplanned, unexpected, all day outages, rude service reps. Rearranging my day to set up service only to deal with a totally inept technician who has to call for backup on another day. I could go on, but why? We are dropping this failure of a company and relying on hotspots from now on."
"Meta of Thornton, CO","Oct. 30, 2016",1,BE WARNED. You will have 10$ hidden fees when you sign up for this service. They charge you extra for the local news stations and a fee for local sports that you will not be told about until you see it on your first bill. The customer service people are a JOKE and rude rude rude. If you ask for a manager they will get snotty and never let you talk to one... I know they have attractive packages to get you hooked but it's a joke and you will pay more in the long run than the competitors.
"Emma of Medford, MA","Oct. 29, 2016",1,"Had Comcast. Overall the terrible experience everyone else is describing but there was no other provider in my area at the time, so we just dealt with it. Ultimately moved out of my apartment to an area that was serviced by other providers, so I called to cancel my account. Took forever, but finally get through, and take my hardware back to the store. KEEP YOUR RECEIPT. Had to deal with a debt collector for 9 months claiming I owed money for not returning the hardware. Luckily I had physical proof. I honestly would have just paid the $60 or whatever it was if I wasn't sure they'd just keep calling. Would deny liability, it would get kicked to a different debt collection agency, someone new would call me a few months later. FINALLY went away, but I will never use Comcast again. The best part is that when I'd call for customer service, they would ""accidentally"" disconnect my call. HINT: If you want to cancel services or complain, choose the option on the customer service menu for ""add more services."" They'll connect you to an agent immediately and you can ultimately get them to connect you to the right department directly. They'll probably still disconnect you a few times though."
"Marc of Bellingham, WA","Oct. 29, 2016",1,"When I called the infinity customer service center to complain about the new slow performance speed the first question customer service asked was ""How fast is it now and why didn't you buy the previous offer for the faster service."" I responded with ""What speed is my plan am I paying for now."" I explained to customer service the actual test was less than half that. The customer service rep said she would resend a signal to my router. No improved speed occurred. I turned on my hotspot on my cell phone to file this complaint. I am getting screw from Comcast/Xfinity. My internet speed is not what I pay for."
"Tyneshia of Murfreesboro, TN","Oct. 27, 2016",1,"Outraged, that it should not take a month to get internet service! We contacted Comcast the 1st week of October for internet service. We was lucky to have a tech come out the same week. When he came he informed us he could not do the installation due to our residence being brand new and there wasn't any type of line of cable to set it. We was told he would have to call a special tech to schedule a date the week after for him to do a burial for a line. The next week came a different tech came out said he couldn't do anything cause there needed to be a burial for the line. We told him the last guy said that and really we thought he was here to do the burial. He told us he was just a guy to set up installation for the modem. He informed us he would drop a line for this special tech to do a burial line and we would soon have our internet up and running by the next week. The same day our neighbours apparently was getting internet with Comcast as well. Their tech stole our line to hook up their internet and cable. We called the tech that came out that day who dropped the line and told him what happened. He ensured us it was ok and the special tech would drop another line when he comes out for the burial. The next week came Monday the tech was scheduled he never showed. We called Comcast. They told us they got behind and someone would come out Tuesday. Tuesday morning a tech came by told us he couldn't do anything. We needed a burial. We told him our story. He called his boss and told us there would be someone to come out to do a burial that same day. Well no one showed up. Here it is Thursday of the same week. I was on the phone with Comcast for almost 2 hrs this morning for them to tell us there will be another tech out on the 31st to a burial and set up installation and he is sorry he's just trying to give us options. Well the truth is there is no other options. No other internet service will provide us with service because of Comcast being in our area on Murfreesboro, TN. I'm stuck with Comcast. I have 3 children with game systems, phones and tablets. Not to mention now a days schools are switching to Apps for kids to do their homework on. Internet is becoming more of a need and not a want. So if it wasn't for my children I wouldn't be getting Comcast. And if there was another service I could get I would definitely be without Comcast. I've had their service in the past. The worst part about having them is their customer service. The bills do tend to go up in price without them informing you and I've had our service not work at times to where I had to reset the modem almost everyday. They need to do a better job with handling issues with customers that's spending money with their company."
"Donnie of Lawrenceville, GA","Oct. 27, 2016",1,"We got Xfinity on the first of July 2016. In the first week and a half, our internet was out, hours at a time, every single day. The first rep that was sent out to fix it said he didn't feel comfortable going in our crawl space so he told me I should reschedule another rep to come out. When I called to reschedule another rep, I learned that the rep that had been there that day, put in his notes that he changed out the splitter and fixed the problem. A couple of days later I had another rep come out with a trainee. They ran a bunch of test, but eventually fixed the problem... until I decided to add tv and security to my package with XFINITY. BIG MISTAKE!! With Comcast/XFINITY everything works off their internet. Cable and security all work off your internet connection. It's the worst setup I have ever encountered. If your internet goes out, not only do you not have internet, but you no longer have cable or security. Anyway, I added the cable and security package a little over a month ago. In this time, at least 2 days out of the week I have gone several hours at a time without internet, and thus, without security and cable as well. The last couple of nights have been the worst! Yesterday internet went out sometime while I was at work in the morning and didn't come back on until after 9 pm last night. Then it went out again sometime in the middle of the night and hasn't been on since. It is now 10:37 pm and I'm still without the services I pay for! XFINITY field tech are some of the worst I have ever encountered. When the tech came out to install cable and security he sat on his phone the whole time talking on the phone with buddies. I was suppose to get a Dvr box. I didn't get one. As for security, this bozo sets the door that he put the keypad next to as a door that never gets used, or as they like to call it, a sentry door. I didn't realize that until I tried getting out that door, a couple days later, and went to set the alarm, just to realize that I could not set the alarm from the inside because it would automatically set the alarm off. I had yet another tech come out 4 days later. This tech fixed the problem and in the process realized that a lot of the way my internet, cable and security was wired was not up to code. So he proceeded to ""fix it"" and in the process did something that started my whole very unreliable internet process again. I had another tech come out 3 days later. He checked wire reliability and ensured that all cables were connected tightly, both inside and outside. He even climbed the power pole. He said he found a loose cable, which he tightened, but just to make sure he even dispatched a bucket truck. The bucket truck arrived about an hour later. He went up the pole checked connections and came back down, just to tell me the same thing the previous tech told me. If I would have known this was going to be such a headache, I would have settled for a slower speed internet, paid a little bit more, and went with AT&T. I have had them before and their reliability was a million times better. The main two differences being AT&T works off of a dedicated fiber optics line where as XFINITY/Comcast is still working off of ancient copper wires. And none of AT&T's services piggyback off of any of their other services. They're all separate dedicated services, whereas All of XFINITY services rely on the internet connection. If the internet goes out, everything goes out."
"Donna of Minneapolis, MN","Oct. 23, 2016",1,"For no known reason, my internet went out on 10/23/2016 - it had been working very well since roughly 7/4/2016, which is shortly after I moved to a new apartment. The afternoon of 10/23, I was catching up with my friends on social media when the page failed to load and there was a message that said it would not load/could not be accessed. First I checked my Wifi links to my laptop and discovered that the Xfinity Wifi (an unsecured network) was active rather than my Home Base (a secured network); then I called the automated line to try to get my modem reset; finally, after waiting ages for the reset, the automated system transferred me over to the tech support line - something I had NOT requested. The rep was very rude and insensitive; first he laughed at me, then he cold-transferred me to another line. If I did not live in a historic building, I would have switched internet/cable providers LONG ago! And the cost! It's criminal. There's got to be a better way to get internet and cable TV - there's got to be a company that cares about its customers, treats them like human beings, and doesn't rob them blind. I feel like I'm stuck in a toxic relationship and can't escape."
"Tina of Pompano Beach, FL","Oct. 20, 2016",1,"I used Comcast for approximately 4 years prior to ATT Uverse. Each customer service rep I had to speak with although seemed ethical, never was. I called to check their promos and was given what I thought was a great price for all three services, and for about 3 months my bill stated exactly what I was quoted. On the 4th month and every month thereafter the bill increased. I was never advised by my Comcast rep that there would be an increase in one year, but why would he if the plan for good for one year? Every month after that I had problems with my bill, always increasing.I finally had enough and after calling Comcast Customer Service and being transferred to three (3) different rep's I finally got a supervisor who after 2 hours on the phone with him had the audacity to tell me that the Comcast rep I originally had when I signed up with Comcast, didn't have the authority to offer me the original promotional price he offered. Well if the customer rep that answers the phone gives me a price should I ask for his credentials or his actual job description? Finally, I contacted ATT Uverse, who initially gave me a promotional price which has finally expired, but even then, UVerse didn't lie to me and kept track of any conversations or offers they gave me. I finally cancelled my service with Comcast and have been with UVerse ever since. I wouldn't go back to Comcast if my life depended on it. They are the worse, lying company I've ever done business with."
"Cindy of Chicago, IL","Oct. 20, 2016",1,"The internet is very SLOW. Although they promise 75 Mbps, I actually got 10 Mbps on average. The bill is ridiculous. When I install their internet, they promise a monthly fee of $59.99 for one year. But in the second month, I got $69.99 on my bill, only because I didn't sign up for paperless bill. But nobody informs me of this before."
"ANTHONY of Fort Lauderdale, FL","Oct. 18, 2016",1,"I am on social security disability and am pretty much confined to my apartment. I got Comcast internet with 10MB for $14.99 a month for two years. Everything was ok until the next month when I got a letter in the mail addressed to me, not a bulk mailing. It offered 50+ channels for $19.99 a month for two years. It had all the channels I wanted. I decided to order it. When I called the representative, couldn't find that offer. After about a half hour she found one that had 35 channels for the same price. It had all the channels I was interested in so I ordered it. After they came and hooked it up I went to use it & could only get ten channels! Less than I was getting with my rabbit ears.After getting the runaround from 3 phone calls I was told they couldn't add the 35 channels to my internet, they had to put me in a bundle. This was never explained to me. This bundle was going to cost me $44.95 instead of $34.98!!! If I wanted to get the 35 channels it was going to cost me around $70.00 a month. Also the never told me I could get away without renting the box with the fancy voice activated remote. Since they had a ""30 day guarantee"" I told them I couldn't afford that price so just come and get the equipment & just give me back my 2 year $14.99 internet back. Well I was told the $14.99 internet was no longer available, only a $19.99 for one year. Asked to speak to a manager & was told there's nothing they could do it was no longer in the computer.I was the manager of a business that sold radio station equipment for ten years. We could manually change the price, description and terms on any item. There is no reason they couldn't go back & restore what I had. Especially since this whole problem was 110% their fault. I got nowhere with them, was so disgusted with the runaround, bait and switch tactics & totally unaware of what they were doing I just canceled the internet too. Comcast is the only show in town except for AT&T. I would never use AT&T because of a problem I had with them. I got a cell phone & internet plan from them. It had a two year contract but the price was right. I had windows 95 at the time. They sent me a windows 98 CD, which definitely wouldn't work.They sent me a total of 7 Windows 98 CD's. Since I couldn't get the internet, I told them I was cancelling it. Well they tried to get me to pay for the whole two year contract. They put that into collections which at last count had been resold. I believe it's like the tenth or eleventh company that has bought the ""debt"". The last one that called said that now with interest & all the fees was around $5000. When I explained about the Windows 95/98 disc problem she was so young she had no idea what Windows 95/98 was!!! L.O.L.So I bought an extender & give my landlord $10.00 to use his. Sometimes when he is playing games loading is real slow & I can't go and sit outside and use it. My only option is to get Metro PCS and use the phone as a hotspot but at $50.00 a month I just can't afford it. As it is I am struggling to get by on $1200.00 a month disability, with $700.00 rent & $120.00 electric plus food it doesn't leave too many discretionary $'s for Comcast's exorbitant $'s. How many people do you know living on less than $400.00 a month???So I am stuck with over the air TV & subpar internet to try and fight off cabin fever. Actually I don't know anyone who raves about either one of these monopolies. Comcast has made enough money with these shenanigans to buy NBC & Universal Studios and parks!!! And they treat customers like this. Same goes for AT&T."
"sandra of Houston, TX","Oct. 17, 2016",1,I set up an appointment and it was inconvenient to make sure I was home. After 30 mins past the window I phoned and spoke to a foreign agent who assured me I would get a call back within 30 mins. An hour later after being given a ticket number no one has bothered to call me. My internet service is so terrible and slow and nonexistent.
"Fei of Denver, CO","Oct. 16, 2016",1,"I called Comcast to claim that there was a voice service which I never used on my account. Actually, I called in this May said I only needed Internet service. However, the phone service was still on my account for half a year. Today I called the Box department and the guy called Louigie was very cold and impersonal and only repeated he didn't see any notes from my former notes about cancelling this service. I said it was weird that there had no notes about that because I came into Comcast store to declare that I only need internet. He just kept saying ""I know"" but did not want to help at all. The person from Box department just made me feel Comcast does not care their customers at all. The negligence they made is paid off by customers. This Louigie guy just showed the worst customer experience I have ever had. Thank you for representing Comcast with this image."
"Jai of Wilsonville, OR","Oct. 12, 2016",2,"service, tech calls never followed thru with. In short, they suck. I also can only use my devices within 15 direct feet of my wireless modem."
"CHARLOTTE of Woodbridge, VA","Oct. 12, 2016",1,"I spent over an hour on chat with ""Jacob"". I told him what my family needs were, and that we've been with a competitor since 2006. He comes back and says ""Sign up today for a two year agreement and for a limited time only, you can get a Visa Card up to $200 (based on the plan selected). Would you like to know more?"" I say ""tell me more."" So he goes on to recommend a plan for me, that I feel was a pretty good deal. However, he COMPLETELY forgets to tell me that the plan HE suggested disqualifies me for the $200 Visa... just never brings it up again until the end when I say, I don't see the $200 Visa on the Final Order. He apologizes for the confusion, I need to get a package that CLEARLY isn't suited for me AND will costs me an additional $110/month for the first 2 years and then an additional $60 month after that. WHAT?This ladies and gentlemen is called BAIT & SWITCH. He KNEW good and well that we were not suited for the Plan that would qualify us for the $200 Visa. Well... it gets worse. I ask him to speak to a manager and he REFUSES to let me communicate with a Manager - tells me ""manager will tell me the same thing."" I have never had Xfinity/Comcast whatever this is, but I cannot believe that they would engage in such shadiness. I told him that I hope corporate agrees with their handling of my situation because I will certainly be sharing. I'll see what corporate thinks, but clearly, I am unimpressed and very disappointed with my experience today."
"Aidan of Corrales, NM","Oct. 11, 2016",1,"I made an account specifically to write a review for Comcast and their horribly rebranded ""Xfinity"" internet service. I moved away from NYC recently where we had Time Warner as our provider for TV, phone, and internet, and I'm starting to miss the days of having to call them once a month to sort out an issue. Xfinity is spotty at best even when it's working ""properly"". We do our best to turn the wifi off of all devices that aren't in use so there are at most 3 or 4 devices connected at a given time. The most intensive of which is generally only one device streaming and possibly a gaming console in use at the same time. Every other device is generally just browsing light web pages or news apps. Constant buffering and inconsistent connection speeds are always an issue. Whenever we reset the router and test the speeds we have a few minutes of decent speed before it goes down again.Beyond the slow and inconsistent connection speeds, at least once a day without fail the connection will drop entirely and we have to restart our modem. When calling Comcast we almost always get a nonsensical machine telling us that service is entirely down in the area, which is simply not true, because after a 10 minute restart process it's restored...for the time being. So getting ahold of anyone is a process in and of itself. When we finally get a human on the phone they clearly don't have any kind of acceptable training and are as blind to the issues as we are.Horrible service and the only reason we are sticking with it is because there literally aren't any other providers in this area. And this is without even getting into the issues with our television service. There genuinely isn't a rating low enough to give to this terrible service with even worse support. Even if on paper the alternatives aren't better, trust me, go with them instead. With the new 1TB data caps per month rolling out nationwide there is even less reason to give your money to these dirtbags."
"Steven of Mt View, CA","Oct. 7, 2016",1,"CrapCast is going to forever ** the consumers for 10x the value of what their services are actually worth. ConCast has even decided to split up its bandwidth forcing its customers to upgrade their old boxes to accommodate XFINITY's new spy software. As for their internet services $50 gets you some rocking speeds, but a $20 they put a governor on that speed."
"john of Portland, OR","Oct. 7, 2016",2,"It's my belief that Comcast agents are poorly trained. I just completed calls to them about my service, and was transferred from ""expert"" to expert, but in the end, my service was not restored, and I currently have no internet provider (Xfinity) because of my upcoming move. No expert at Comcast can reinstate my account, and I just might have to take Comcast to small claims court. The cable service was very good, but now that I use wifi exclusively it does not work at all. I'm currently using a hotspot at our free public library."
"Kristy of Payson, UT","Oct. 6, 2016",1,"All of the negative reviews you read have common themes. Comcast was great for the first year. Increased the Price the second which was never disclosed. Increased again the third year and again when I cancelled. Every time you talk to someone they are reading a script and don't answer your question or understand what you are trying to get resolved. They answer everything with ""I have a promotion for you"". I never get angry but after a month of trying to resolve our problems and being lied to over and over again I lost my cool and hung up. So done. I would rather have no internet and use wifi hotspots or even our Podunk library that has 3 computers than ever sign up with this ridiculously shady company. Buyer COMPLETELY BEWARE!!!"
"Ron of Sewell, NJ","Oct. 5, 2016",1,"I have been having issues with my internet gateway (supplied by Comcast) for over a year. At least twice each day my gateway loses the connection and does a total reset. Not only does this interrupt my internet connection but also my phone service. Multiple times I have been on important telephones with clients only to have my phone service go dead. Not to mention all the times I have been using the internet for work and have it untimely disconnect. Over the past 12+ months I have made approximately three dozen calls to their support center and have had a dozen plus technicians come to my home. Unfortunately each time a technician is scheduled, I need to be home to wait for them. Unfortunately, none of the technicians have resolved the issue. The last time a supervisor came, changed a few wires, and gave me his number ** to call if I was still having issues. After placing 3 calls to him over the past 2 weeks he has not returned my call. Two people from their corporate office called and gave me their numbers. The first number (800) 597-6022 x-** has not returned my call after me leaving numerous voice messages. The second person (800) 597-6022 x-** at least answers her phone, however she has not been able to get the service supervisor to return my call.I don't think I am asking for too much. All I want them to do is resolve the issue. They can start by returning calls. Further attempt to resolve the issue by refraining from sending the same skill level technicians to my home. If the first 11 technicians with the same skill level could not resolve the issue what makes them think the 12th technician with the same skill level will do any better! It is really poor and unacceptable customer service when multiple calls to different company representatives are not returned."
"Andres of Margate, FL","Oct. 1, 2016",1,"If the service would be reliable, I could possibly give 2-3 stars. I have experienced daily outages at any time of the day. I pay for service so that I can turn on my Smart TV and watch cable TV or use the internet when it is convenient for me. The repeated outages totally prevents convenience and the experience of enjoying the service. I believe Xfinity is only using temporary fixes for the outages instead of actually creating or replacing equipment for a permanent fix. It doesn't mater if it rains or shines, the service is temperamental."
"Vince of Fort Myers, FL","Sept. 30, 2016",1,"While on the internet doing some secure banking, I was interrupted by Comcast, to take one of their surveys. I consider this hacking and an invasion of my privacy. Comcast has no right to interfere with my internet connection for any reason without a court order. If Comcast is snooping on its Customers it is an invasion of privacy and against the law. If anyone else has had this happen to them please reply to this email address and include your name to be included in a class action lawsuit against Comcast. **. Thank you."
"PETER of Vero Beach, FL","Sept. 27, 2016",1,"At least two to three times a week, usually late night or early morning Comcast internet service goes out. The latest time it went out at midnight and stayed out till 4:30 in the morning or later. The other complaint I have is that I pay for a minimum of 80 megabytes a second and Comcast rarely delivers this. AT&T is in the process of putting fiber optic directly to my house and my neighborhood. I am definitely going to take advantage of their service. It will cost less and being that it's fiber optic directly to the house will be much more reliable. It will also allow me to completely get rid of Comcast forever."
"Norris of Atlanta, GA","Sept. 20, 2016",1,"I requested the $19.99 internet service. However, I was billed $49.99. After speaking with more than seven customer service representative, I was told they couldn't correct the overbilling. Obviously, I'm VERY DISSATISFIED!!!"
"Monica of Jacksonville, AR","Sept. 19, 2016",1,"First off, I've been without internet for a week and on demand for a week as well. So I call the second day after nothing worked the first day to schedule a visit and the automated system kept saying that there was an outage in my area and it'll be resolved by 12:36. So I call later that afternoon and tell them and they try to send signals to the modem or whatever and it wouldn't work. So we scheduled a visit for that Friday between 10-12. Mind you that the first option they gave me was for the following freaking Monday and I said HECK NO that is way too long, I have a business to run.So the guy came on Friday at 1:30 NOT between 10-12 because I saw him pull up, he sat there for like 20 minutes and when I looked again he was freaking gone! So now I'm a little hot, so I call and ask what the heck is going on and why'd he just leave and the lady said, ""Well there's another outage in your area and he wouldn't have been able to do anything but he should have at least came to your door and told you but he didn't"". So later we rescheduled another appointment for Sunday between 3-4 and confirmed it.So I don't go to church. I'm here waiting on them to come and it's 4 and all call like, ""Where are you guys?"" And this lady on the phone tells me that it has been rescheduled for freaking Tuesday! I'm like WTF! Seriously! How the heck can you just do that?!! She said that after further checking for like 10 mins that the local office called to reschedule but no one picked up so we couldn't confirm. I was like, ""But you just said it's scheduled for Tuesday so how the heck did you confirm that if no one picked up?"" They didn't call by the way. So you just don't come?? You cancel it on your own and don't freaking show up?!! She said ""yes ma'am that's correct..."" So I'm pissed by now and then she says that someone will call me back by 6 with a rescheduled... No one has called!!! This isn't the first time something like this has happened... But I can guarantee it'll be the last... I'M GOING WITH DIRECT!!! Š“‘"
"Matthew of Tomball, TX","Sept. 19, 2016",1,"I was asking the guy on phone why when I subnet themes router it make Comcast go down. The guy then said ""don't hook the cable from the router to a cable box"". I had said 6 or 8 times cat 5 or cat 6 wire why would that type be hook to a cable box. I ask what he was talking about he said ""rg6 cable jack on modem should not be hook to cable box."" WOW he wasn't listening to me. I have video game systems I would rather have use cat 6 wire then WiFi but I also have network printer with only rj45 and 1 out of 4 tv has a dead WiFi chip that 2 port and I plan on network hard drive 3 port and number 4 desktop. He said ""Comcast didn't teach them about anything about networking. They learn only about Comcast gear"" that when I hung up my network speed is going to be 150mbps. I don't understand why. If it that high you can't subnet theme home internet. I would buy a router/modem but none has phone line for fax."
"Justin of Sinking Spring, PA","Sept. 18, 2016",1,"I started trying to cancel my Xfinity subscription in an online chat with them which they said they would help me and wasted about 20 minutes of my time before they told me I had to call retention at the number they provided me which I did. And then after talking to them for about five to ten minutes they said I would have to call back tomorrow to talk to retention to cancel my service. To which I said ""I thought I was talking to someone in the retention department,"" which she replied she was retention but could not cancel my service today and that I would have to call the same number again tomorrow."
"Ruth of Ft. Pierce, FL","Sept. 18, 2016",1,"I live in Treasure Coast FL and have been trying to get the internet working since August 21, 2016 - now 19 Sept. It has been on and off, on and off, on and off. ONLY in their Corp area do they make customer service a priority."
"Marshall of Knoxville, TN","Sept. 17, 2016",1,"On a Game Day in Knoxville, Tn they know how everyone loves to watch the VOLS. This cable company along with Infinity had the worse reception ever you could not even watch the game. This is the only cable company we can get are the Comcast/Infinity with are the same ones that's why they own us like KUB. We have to have it. This company really sucks. Do not ever get this either place. They say Infinity is another company but why they are in same building and same trucks just different lettering?"
"mike of South Bend, IN","Sept. 14, 2016",1,"I have been Comcast customer since 2009. My house was build in 2013. I pay $99.06 for internet extreme 150. According to the customer solution I should be getting 150 mbps but since I move to the extreme 150 I have not been able pass 84-91 mbps. So I call multiple times - Hours and speaking with several 2nd tier tech support and none of them are able to find why I can't get over 100 mbps.Then two tech came in house and nothing change. They don't know what is the issue. After several days and fees, someone in Comcast was able to tell me the conclusion. CONCLUSION - Comcast does not guarantee 150 mbps - it is up to 150 mbps but the marketing department wrote this FK add and it is all over the internet-TV advertising speed up to 200 mbps.IT IS A JOKE - I challenged Comcast support tier 3 and customer solution to proof that they test the speed connectivity from their demark to my residence ending point - NOTHING. I ask for another Tech to come in my house and ask him to test speed from my endpoint to their Demark. I saw the tech with a stupid device that they Carry around to check connection. The tech device checked the speed and the result was 21-26 mbps and my computer shows 83 mbps. That rule that my hardware is fine. So then the tech told me it is marketing. I tried AT&T and Verizon but ONLY Comcast is allow in my resident area. JOKE - CONSUMERAFFAIRS - if you read this review, you should investigate this scam from Comcast."
"Rina of Clarksville, TN","Sept. 11, 2016",1,"Since I have been with xfinity comcast have had problem with agents and supervisor giving different instructions every time you call them. Some were rude and not willing to help at all. There are a few who goes above and beyond to help. For instance, I spoke with a male manager, who had informed me that I should have not both the modem arris SB6183 (which cost $100) because they are not compatible with them. However, I specifically bought it because the previous agent informed me it was compatible and to make it worst the box for arris states COMPATIBLE WITH COMCAST. How can someone be a manager and doesn't know his equipments and be a good customer service. Very frustrating. Then I called them today to ask for a password for our internet service. The agent gave me their website knowing that it's my personal equipment so when I called again the next agent was unwilling to help and saying that the other agent should have not done that. I spoke with their manager again; this tiny female, and she said I should call the manufacturer for the modem to get the password. Again another manager who doesn't know what she was talking about. First all modem is not wifi can't do password. It needs to be my wifi router. Unless she thought it is router and modem together but she shouldn't have because they saw in their system - that's it's my personal modem with its model number which is modem only. What kind of people are they are hiring."
"An of Wayne, PA","Sept. 10, 2016",1,"They jacked up rates without informing us. Then reaching a live agent was nearly impossible, as the prompts kept guiding us to upgrade our service or add new services."
"Paige of Birchrunville, PA","Sept. 10, 2016",1,"Just over an hour with 3 different departments and supervisors and multiple holds on a Saturday to find out the movie I BOUGHT on Pay per view is malfunctioning. Have been with comcast for years, spent thousands of dollars and just didn't want to focus on changing services. I have multiple services to choose from and will be spending the time to change after this fiasco. There are so many complaints about Comcast it doesn't seem worthwhile to go into the details here as nothing ever improves so I am out."
"Margaret of Moriches, NY","Sept. 10, 2016",1,"So I have had Comcast in the past and my recent experience brought back suppressed memories. The sales representative made a mistake on my install date which I found out on the day of when no one showed up to install my equipment. He never apologized for it. He knew I was busy and was not able to accommodate me when I needed the time rescheduled. I opted for self-install because I was already without Internet and it was unsuccessful. I kept on being transferred to India with no resolution when they attempted to activate the signal. There is no such thing as customer service with Comcast, there is no customer satisfaction. They should be out of business."
"Erica of Milton, MA","Sept. 9, 2016",1,"I was experiencing some technical difficulties with my on demand service in June. Technical support solution to this problem was to reset my box. After a couple of attempts they seemed to have the system up and running. The support rep asked me if I was able to access any movies. I said yes. He said ""you're all set"". This problem happened again in July. They redid the whole previous process again. Again telling me it's all set. In August my fiance called regarding an entirely different issue, went to automated system, told him his account balance was almost $500.00. We thought that had to be a mistake. After speaking with the billing dept we found out there was over 100 on-demand movies ordered in 1 month. I was really confused due to I had a lock on the service & a code would be needed to make any purchase. I did not give anyone this code. Apparently, when tech support reset my boxes it wiped out all of my parental settings. So, my 5 yr old son was able to order anything he wanted to watch. A little over 100 movies and episodes. I made 5 phone calls about this issue in the following 2 days. Comcast/Xfinity refused to remove the charges saying the movies and episodes were watched. The supervisor I requested to speak to never called me back. Finally I spoke to a rep that reviewed the account and got a supposed supervisor to approve a credit to my account due to our history not showing these sort of purchases before or any incidences like this. She went on to say she would need to split the credit into 2 due it exceeding her credit applying limit. She thanked me for being a loyal customer and we hung up. Well, after making a payment earlier this week I come home to find my service interrupted. It was too late to speak to anyone at 9:30 pm so I called the following afternoon. Only to find out after we hung up after that call in August, there was a so called review which lead to someone determining the credits would not to applied to my account due to the movies and episodes were all watch. Even though their technical support wiped out my parental settings and told me I was all set. I am so dissatisfied with this whole experience I am returning my equipment. I will never be a Comcast/Xfinity customer ever again."
"Zhi of Saint Paul, MN","Sept. 3, 2016",1,"I have been using Comcast internet for 3 years. It was so far so good. I had this promotion last year and I am calling two months ago to the Comcast hotline asking if they are able to extend it for another year. The agents said yes. But today I checked my account and found that the promotion is GONE. I call the customer service and they could not find any record. And they start charging me 90 per month, which double what I had before. This company is unfaithful. Do not use its internet service! As you never know when it will cheat on you!"
"Jocelyn of Franklin, TN","Sept. 2, 2016",1,"We have been with Comcast for less than 6 months. 1st of all when setting up our cable & Internet & security system they sent an unprofessional individual who spent over 10 hours setting these services up in our home - very uncomfortable and so glad we had no plans to leave our home that day. Second of all we have had poor connection with the Internet since day 1. We called for a technician to come out and it took 1 week to send someone out... This is not our main complaint. Our main complaint is that the ""technician"" they sent out was another unprofessional employee who ended up running exposed wires from the middle of our cul de sac through our neighbors yard and our yard in order for us to have ""working Internet"". We were a little taken aback by this form of set up and asked when these exposed wires would be buried. The unprofessional ""technician"" then informed us he would submit for another technician to come out & bury the wires. After 2 business days we had not heard from any ""follow up technician"" and so on the 3rd business day after our Internet was ""fixed"" we called in to find out what was going on with burying the exposed wires. We spoke to a Wanda and were told that no one had submitted a ""fix it ticket""! After explaining to her everything we had gone through, she then said that a technician would be calling us to come out soon. After waiting 2 more days from talking to Wanda we decided to call back and find out when this ""technician"" was scheduled to come out. We ended up speaking with a Mrs. ** who also told us that we still had no ""fix it ticket"" in the system!! She then heard the WHOLE story and told me that she would call me later that day (yesterday) and let me know who would be coming out but that I should have been told it would take 14 days to fix. I was like - ""14 additional days... Cause it's already been 1 full week since these wires have been exposed""... So I never heard from Mrs. ** as she promised and I called in today and spoke with someone who told me they live in the Philippines and explained EVERYTHING yet AGAIN and long story short... My husband is on the phone STILL trying to get this resolved before September 12th as we were told today is when they are sending a ""technician"" out to bury our exposed wires. I am writing this because unfortunately Comcast is NOT WORTH USING! They have not apologized or resolved our issues!! We will be getting Apple TV & or Netflix after this! Please be warned... This is an unprofessional company that does not deserve our hard earned money or time!"
"Rebecca of Conyers, GA","Sept. 1, 2016",1,"We paid over $3,000 to have Comcast run internet to our home. Ever since the beginning they have not been able to provide a signal nor have they provided the speed that we have paid for. We have had tech after tech at our home. We had some that said what was wrong only to be contradicted by the next rep. Finally they talked us into going to Business Internet--this too is not working. I have escalated to all levels of management and have had no results. We are now paying over $150.00 per month for internet and this week have dropped over 30 times. Just today 9/1/2016 we lost signal at 9:00 AM, 9:58 AM, 10:46 AM, 12:58 AM and now at 3:45 PM finally no internet came back and I called and they sent a refresh signal. This has been going on way too long to only get a refresh signal. Something is wrong and NO ONE is willing to help!!!"
"Melvin of Delray Beach, FL","Aug. 31, 2016",1,"Watching tv and the picture went off with an ""error"" message and number. I was instructed to call service immediately and give them the number. I did so, and was asked ""What does that number mean, as I never heard it before."" I hung up and the next morning I went to the store to get a new DVR box returning the old one. I came home, hooked it up, only to find that this box did not work either. Again a trip to the store to get a new box and this one worked. Intermittent phone and internet service caused me to get 5 ""NEW"" (recycled, I'm sure) modems. Oh goodie, we were just informed we are getting the ""new'"" XFINITY X1 SYSTEM... CAN'T WAIT!!"
"F. D. of Chattanooga, TN","Aug. 31, 2016",1,"Well, I moved to Chattanooga from Atlanta for a new career venture. I haven't purchased cable for at least 4 yrs now because I stream everything and I firmly believe cable tv is a waste of money that will soon be obsolete. Back to topic, I opted for Xfinity/Comcast over Chattanoogas EPB mostly because it was familiar and cheaper. I got a pretty decent deal coming from a previously handsome employee management discount with ATT. Although UVerse was even worse than Xfinity/Comcast, I put up with it because it was so cheap. So, Comcast. Good deal. Great internet speed. No contract.The first issue arose after a month and a half in. I kept getting a notification that I was about to reach my data limit and would be charged $10 per gig if I went over. I was never informed of data caps when I purchased. If so, I would have opted for EPB because they have none and I stream a lot. I can't have a data cap of 600gigs a month. So I called to complain and cancel. I had already contacted EPB and set up an install date. I'm not sure why but I called Comcast again to inquire more about the data cap and to tell them that I wasn't paying for overages. I was then informed that Comcast had decided to raise the data caps to 1050gigs. I was assured that I would never reach it so I decided to stay with Comcast.Now that that was resolved it was back to my regular schedule until I noticed that my internet speeds were gradually getting slower. Then over the past 3 weeks, the internet connection started dropping. I called and was told it was my router. That it was damaged and needed to be exchanged for a new one. I never got around to getting a new router but it kept dropping at the same time every day between 7 pm & 9 pm. So I contacted them again and the Rep fixed the issue and told me that the problem wasn't my router but the way it was wired.So after rewiring it was working fine but now it's not only getting slower every day but the connection drops frequently. Still between certain hours but always after 6 pm. It's so bad now that it's dropping the connection at least every 30 to 45 mins. That's just this evening and even now at 12:55 am EST. I have two choices... Wait between 7-10 mins for the router to reboot and reconnect on its own once the connection returns or I manually unplug and force a reboot which takes a while as well and still does not guarantee a connect even after all the lights are solid and flashing.Now I have the Xfinity My Account app which NEVER says there is a reported outage but instead just informs me that my router is not connected to the internet. I can also restart via the app but it's useless too. I've finally had enough. I'm leaving Comcast behind. It's become a complete hassle. I'm paying for services that I can only enjoy up until 6 pm daily. I'm at my wits end. Comcast is officially the worst internet service in the nation. I mean Uverse is extremely slow but I could at least depend on that slow connection. It rarely went down... Even in storms but with Comcast I can't even keep a connection. If you have Comcast do yourself a favor and rid yourself of it."
"Philo of Portland, OR","Aug. 28, 2016",1,"We signed up for Xfinity/Comcast but have been unable to watch 60 Minutes, the Olympics, and frequently other network channels. We get an error message to ""try later"". We called Xfinity with the error code, and instead of refunding any of our bill, they said the problem was on our end and would send out a technician. The technician came out and found no problems on our end and said this could happen from heavy traffic. We were billed for this call. We talked to Ryan at Xfinity (upper level technician) and he refused to refund tech support call, claiming his technician ""had not left notes about what was found"". He refused to offer credit for our outages but suggested we pay an additional fee for protection against outages. BBB complaint has been filed."
"Ian of Point Pleasant, NJ","Aug. 27, 2016",1,"Xfinity (Comcast)... has a very obvious political agenda. I use Xfinity as my home page. That is about to end. Also am rethinking using Comcast altogether. The Xfinity home page is ALWAYS anti-Trump, anti-Republican party. All of the news for selection is very bias, so it is not ""news"" it is opinion. I am very disappointed. Is there anywhere I can go for fair reporting?"
"Collin of Gurnee, IL","Aug. 24, 2016",1,"Every single time I have a service outage I have to call and spend roughly 10 minutes -15 minutes on the phone to get a service credit. They give out credits based on the time the internet was down so it ends up being only like a dollar. The problem is they KNOW my address is under a service outage but they put zero effort into identifying customers effected by the outage and they DO NOT apply credits automatically, rather they WAIT UNTIL A CUSTOMER CALLS, to apply the credit.The catch 22 is that IS A 15 MINUTE PHONE CALL TALKING TO A WALL WORTH A DOLLAR? They basically steal people's credits by making them waste time calling in so that ultimately it won't be worth it. TERRIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICE. Customer service reps, while repetitive, honestly try their best with irate customers such as myself, and their job is highly under appreciated as well as they're not given the tools to solve issues on the front line. Comcast is a semi monopolistic cable provider and their service shows it. Their TRASH company will ultimately fail if other providers break into the market."
"Lisa of Fort Lauderdale, FL","Aug. 23, 2016",1,"I have Comcast only because in my area there is only the choice of the ""two evil giants"", AT&T and Comcast which results in a stranglehold, illegal trust-like (monopoly) grip on consumers. Everything was working as well as could be expected (for Comcast) up until 2AM last Friday when my Internet suddenly went dead. My computer was receiving the router and modem just fine, all lights on as normal, but I could not open any web pages. Just an error message page from Xfinity.I called and I was told that my modem was ""end-of-life"" (Motorola Surfboard SB 6121, DOCSIS 2.0) and was no longer being supported, so it was REMOVED FROM MY ACCOUNT! THEY CUT ME OFF! I only bought it ONE YEAR ago. Hell, my cell phone is SEVEN years old and still works fine! I was told my options would be to rent a newer one from them or go buy a new one. UNACCEPTABLE for Comcast to dictate to me how I spend my money. Mind you, I am still paying for my Internet service, which I am not getting. A new modem costs $125. To rent from Comcast is $10/month. So If I buy one, it won't pay for itself for 12.5 months. By then, are they going to cut me off again and force me to buy yet another newer modem???First they told me they could not put the modem ID numbers back in my account by phone, that I had to drive across town to a Comcast store with my own modem and have it done there. After my threats of leaving Comcast for AT&T, they agreed to put my modem ID numbers back in my account and tried unsuccessfully to get a signal to the modem.After many aggravating hours over four days (I'm talking like full-time job hours!) I managed to get on the phone with a reasonable Level III Technician who told me he agreed that it should be up to the consumer when to replace their own equipment, especially if it was still working. He got the ID number replaced again, but still wasn't able to get it connected. Finally, I was scheduled to wait two days for 2 service techs to come out to the house to investigate my lines. But my lines were all BRAND NEW from the utility pole all the way to the modem, as I had replaced the roof on my house three weeks earlier and all the lines had to be cut and replaced (by Comcast).SO... AND HERE'S WHAT YOU ALL SHOULD DO. I filed a complaint with my State Attorney General Consumer Protection Division AND the same with the FCC!! I said it was fraudulent business practices to cut off paying customers from services in order to coerce them into renting or buying new equipment at Comcast's discretion. In addition, that since there are only two providers in my area, it is still not unlike an illegal trust situation. Apparently, the FCC agrees that I have a case. They immediately forwarded my complaint to Comcast.Within hours, I had the ""Indian call center"" contact me to offer me a credit to my account and to attempt to restore my service at once. It so happened that the service techs showed up just at the same time. They found filters were installed on my lines and removed them, then they found that the ID number the phone techs put in was one digit wrong!!! I only repeated the correct numbers about 8 times! End of story, they got everything running. Speed test shows I'm getting 57 mbps while I'm paying for 75 mbps, but all you ""techies"" know that's to be expected. I may go out and buy the SB 6190 (DOCSIS 3.0) when I can afford the $125 - BUT THAT'S UP TO ME!"
"domenic of Bellevill, NJ","Aug. 22, 2016",1,"I was mislead to what the billing would be and was not given the correct information, I believe, due to the fact I am Italian, speak broken english and told the sales guy, that I could not read a lot english. My bill keeps going up and I keep getting different reasons. I got charged for service for a box that was setup by the cable guy, when I explained this, I was told to get service protection. I got that, and 2 months later, I have a problem, and once again I am charged for the service. They take advantage of elderly people, as well as those that cannot speak or understand english."
"Jon of Evans, GA","Aug. 20, 2016",1,"This is the company that will come over to your neighbors to install internet service and leave an orange cable across your driveway for weeks (a safety hazard for those children in the neighborhood). Then show up on a Friday afternoon to bury such cables weeks afterwards, cut your house internet line, and ruin your front yard while working. Upon calling about their own technicians disabling your internet, they expect for you to wait four days later without any internet service. To top it off, a service supervisor will then tell you that a dispatch ticket was created for someone to come to your house the following day, but it turns out to be the same ticket number for that appt. four days later. Upon calling to explain the situation they keep you on hold for nearly 40 minutes, then the line cuts off. No one calls you back either. I completely lost count of the amount of lies that I have experienced with Comcast in a course of 2 years. This company should not exist and people deserve better. I just don't understand how the US government allows this type of company to grow/expand, yet offer such horrible service and rip people off who don't know any better. I had so much reading to do over the weekend for school and now I have no internet until Tuesday over something Comcast did themselves."
"Samuel of Dayton, IN","Aug. 19, 2016",1,"I've been with Comcast for about a year and a half, I've gone through 2 modems, they just seem to go out, for the past 2 months my Internet has stopped working for about 5 mins a day to a whole day ever day. I have to reset my modem about 3-4 times a day for it to work, I call Comcast they never find anything wrong. If you're interested in having Comcast I'd say don't, it's not worth the headache and the money, if there was any other cable company in my area that offers the same speeds or close, I'd switch faster than Usain Bolt can run."
"Eric of Davis, CA","Aug. 18, 2016",1,"Comcast debt collectors have contacted me several times over the last 2 1/2 years for an account that was closed out in Jan, 2014 and that has had a zero balance. Each time they claim that I owe a different amount and each time Comcast confirms that nothing is owed. The recent debt collector confirmed that any money paid is forwarded to their offices. They are definitely in contact with Comcast and they use a Comcast internal email: cendiv_collectionagencyescalations@comcast.cable.com. These actions have the appearance of fraudulent efforts to extract money. They waste my time and are very annoying. Think about what your time is worth before selecting a provider."
"Mark of Cape Canaveral, FL","Aug. 18, 2016",1,"Honestly, we see thousands of complaints, it's a monopoly here in SWFL with no realistic competition. I imagine that as long as they keep the politicians happy ($$) they will get whatever they want. Like many of us, I have major horror stories. Yes they increase prices every year, unless you join for two years. Yes they continuously lie to you with minimal recourse. Yes their customer service is akin to the third world, and they have us.I have spent multiple hours for the simplest problems, now all I want is high speed internet, between Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu + a antennae I am perfectly happy. But their ultimate goal is to keep you with multiple shopping channels, infomercials 24 hours per day, and general garbage at expensive monthly rates. All of my dealings with them is via chat, since I can at least document the information, note: you do need to copy and paste the information because unlike most chats you cannot copy your chat. My latest problem is changing monthly from $50 to $75 for internet only, and I wish I could go somewhere else but as long as we have politicians turning a blind eye to this problem, we will never get anywhere."
"Linda of Atlanta, GA","Aug. 17, 2016",1,"Constant difficulties with internet service, poor response to telephone support, unbelievable hold times, disconnects. Service always ""magically"" returns; but the down times last from 5 minutes to several hours. This is not what I pay for and is never addressed nor corrected. Some days it's on and off every 10 minutes. Comcast - when it's good it's good, when it's bad it's awful."
"D. Michael of Hinsdale, IL","Aug. 16, 2016",1,"A year ago, Comcast talked me into a 12 month promotion for Internet-only service. I got higher speeds for less money. Great, except now that the 12 month promotion is over, my bill more than TRIPLED. I called to go back to my previous service at my previous price. Comcast now says my previous service is 'no longer offered', and my new 3X-priced service is my lowest cost option. It's not a technical issue - they offer my former service at my former price to new subscribers, but not to existing customers. What Comcast is doing is surcharging existing customers and using that money to subsidize 'teaser' pricing for new customers. Those 'teaser' plans will be yanked after the promo ends, and those customers will end up being surcharged to subsidize teaser rates for the next round of saps."
"Shelia of Dothan, AL","Aug. 15, 2016",1,"I have been with Comcast for 7 years. Got new infinity modem. It never worked maybe 3 months. Had service men out here every other month. One even got caught lying that he fixed something and didn't touch it. They owed me some credit. I also have spent hours on phone getting different stories. Now they want 500 to turn it back on. The supervisor told me I didn't complain enough to get all my credit and couldn't go back to last year and see how many I had to get them to come and fix it. I finally got fed up took modem back in June...no credits, no cable, bad business. Something has to be done about these crooks. Pissed in Alabama."
"Sandy of Bloomington, IL","Aug. 15, 2016",1,"My complaint is not really with the reps (although maybe). At work we have Comcast for internet and for email. Our internet service was so poor we called them, they confirmed our settings, made changes and then now charge is $20 plus for the change. Trouble is the service is even worse and we pay more for it. To log into email it often takes a good 10 mins. no matter how I attempt it. I absolutely will not allow them in the house. A rep stood on my porch (uninvited) and argued with me about letting them carry my service. Finally I told her to get out and shut the door on her. I, myself, now use Frontier and have no problem at all with my internet service."
"Hayley of Memphis, TN","Aug. 13, 2016",1,"Our WiFi had stopped working in our apartment, so we made an appointment for someone to come and fix it. It said they'd be here from 3-5 and they ended up showing up at around 630. He said that the apartment needed to be rewired, and that he'd have to get someone else to come and fix it. So he made an appointment for me right there. The soonest available appointment was about a week later on a Thursday from 1-3. My boyfriend took off work to be home that day to let the guy in. However, no one showed up. He looked on the website and the app, and it said no appointment was scheduled. So he called Comcast and they said the guy came and had to come back the next day to finish. This was kind of odd because no one ever came to our apartment. And they never called us to tell us they were coming either like they're supposed to. So Friday, the next day, someone was supposed to come back and finish it. Well no one ever showed up. We called Comcast again, which is really annoying because every time you call them you speak to a new person and have to re-explain your whole situation to them and they're not very helpful. The person on the phone said that someone came on Friday, but no one was home and that they left a thing on the door saying they came. Well that's ** because my boyfriend was here the whole time and no one came. There wasn't anything left on the door either. So they basically lied to us. I doubt anyone actually came on that Thursday either. (They said the work would need to be done outside so we might not see them. But you think they would've still had to come inside and let us know they're there right?) So anyway then they said someone would come on Monday. They finally came on Monday and fixed it. But for about 3 weeks we didn't have internet. We haven't gotten our next bill yet, but they better not charge us for those 3 weeks. It was hard to get in contact with a real person (you have to go through this whole automated phone thing) and then like I said you have to explain your situation over and over again. Why can't they just have the same person or manager talk to you until a situation is resolved? I hate Comcast, but they can do whatever the ** they want and get away with it because there's only like 2 internet providers."
"E of New York, NY","Aug. 11, 2016",1,"They will change your services without notice and charge you more. Also, they know there are no other providers in my area so they have jacked up prices to a lot more than TWC or FIOS customers pay anywhere for LESS service. I googled and found out that there had been a class action lawsuit 15 years ago exactly for this reason but somehow COMCAST managed to drag it along for 12 years then paying nothing."
"andrew of Gaithersburg, MD","Aug. 8, 2016",1,"I have Xfinity from Comcast. Every few months the price goes up. I've complained to them before about this and they lower the price but try to give a new contract for 2 years, then in a few months the price goes up again. I'm talking about the price going from $119 per month to $145 per month. I'm sure this is illegal and I'm disgusted with this dishonest company. I will also be reporting this to the better business bureau!"
"Lupe of Cleveland, OH","Aug. 6, 2016",1,After taking an initial $64 they do a credit check... I need my money back. I never finished my application online. This is a ** COMPANY!
"Kevin of Coon Rapids, MN","Aug. 5, 2016",5,"Experienced intermittent internet issues. Called and spoke to a very friendly and professional customer service person in their internet area. Spent a good amount of time working through possible causes, gave me a few possible paths to fix with where he would start. End up going with having a tech come out. Tech who came out, THE SAME DAY, was also fantastic. He found one problem area with a line and opted to replace all of the cable lines we had. Connection is fantastic now! Tech was friendly and offered tons of advice about cable lines and keeping dogs away from them."
"Hannah of Chicago, IL","Aug. 5, 2016",1,"I have always hated Comcast, but have used their services for years just because they are the most common service provider. I recently moved and tried to set up Internet through them at my new apartment. The confirmation email I received after ordering the service was completely wrong. They had my wrong address and did not even give me an account number for my new service. I contacted a rep online to get it sorted out. He was so unknowledgeable and unhelpful, I told him I just wanted to cancel the service altogether. He assured me my card would not be charged for the service because he cancelled it. I told him ""ok so when my card IS charged for it anyway, can I get a reference # for this chat for my personal records?"" He blatantly refused to give it to me. I had to ask to speak to a supervisor who finally gave me the code and also 100% assured me my card would not be charged.This morning I checked my bank account and was not at all surprised to find a withdrawal from Comcast. I immediately called and the rep I spoke to wasted almost 2 hours of my time just to tell me she can't find any account charge so she can't do anything about it. I again had to ask for a manager, who instantly said he found the charge and would refund it. I now have to wait 5-7 business days for a refund check for a charge I was repeatedly promised would not be made. The worst customer service in the nation. Will never be a Comcast customer again. I am willing to pay MORE money at this point for literally any other provider."
"Kyle of Bloomington, IL",42582,5,"I read all about Comcast's customer service reps and was prepared for a nightmare. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the sales rep Sally. She helped me set up my new internet deal Lickity Split. People complain about how things weren't part of their agreement or other things of the sort. My advice if you're preparing to wrestle with Comcast reps go in prepared and be firm on your choice but also be polite and you'll find a much more pleasant experience than that which you read about."
"Summer of Sacramento, CA",42581,1,They are extremely disrespectful and would not help me or explain anything. I will never use Xfinity again and I will never recommend that anyone use Xfinity Comcast ever again due to my experience. I wouldn't want anyone to go through that.
"James of Eugene, OR",42580,1,"So I tried to hook my printer up to my network through the provided modem through Comcast. I called in last night to get the USB port on the back to have it enabled, which is what the chat rep told me to do. I spoke to 3 different agents, none of which spoke or even understood English. No matter how much I explained it to them they kept asking me if I was trying to hook my internet up through the USB. So at that point I was pretty pissed.The next day, today, I called in and got an agent who spoke and understood English, thank god. I was told that it would be an ""easy fix"" and they would transfer me to an Advanced Network Tech. I said OK and waited on hold for about 30 minutes. I got to the new tech and explained my issue and first off he laughed at me. Second he told me the USB ports on the back do not even work. Being mad that no one told me this before, I proceed to ask why they sell/rent them that way. He said it isn't something they care enough to fix and then said have fun and hung up on me.I have had nothing but problems with Comcast ever since I started using them in 2010. But the only reason I use them is I have to. They strong-arm everyone else that is decent out so they own the area. They outsource to people who do not speak or understand English when there are millions without jobs here in the US who have a firm grasp on the language. They do not care about their customers so much that they lie to them over and over and we have to deal with it because we have no other options because of their corrupt practices of getting others out of the area. This is why people want Google Fiber!"
"Dale of Whiting, IN",42580,1,"The internet service Comcast provides is a royal pain. Not only do you not get anywhere near (not even half) of the speeds you pay for, it is constantly plagued with drops and DNS issues. Where I live, there are not many alternatives or I would have switched months ago. If you call Comcast they tell you to reboot the modem even if you tell them the history and that you have already tried that numerous times. One would hope in this day and age an ISP would be reliable, reasonably priced and FAST. Comcast done not seem to be any of those - at least in the internet arena."
"John of Miami, FL",42580,1,"2 - 3 weeks ago I started having problems with my internet. Sometimes it would work perfect and I would get 70MB+ download speed, other times it would drop to ~2MBŠ—_ I work from home and I am constantly using Skype to stay in touch with co-workers and clients, you can do this with 2MB d/l. I immediately followed the normal, try to unplug the wireless modem and plug it back in, no change. I called in and used their automated system to reset the modem, no change. I had a modem that was not being rented from Comcast so they were reluctant to send a service tech out to help and pretty much just blamed the problem on the modem. I called the modem provider followed their troubleshooting, no change.. they assured me the problem was with ComcastŠ—_Here comes the fun part. I decide to get a modem from Comcast so I can get a tech out to resolve the problem. I have three options: 1. Get it shipped for $10, 2. Have it delivered and installed by a tech for $50, 3. Pick it up myself for free. Being the kind of person that likes to save money, I go with option 3. The woman at Comcast I spoke to told me I could go to their Leominster MA location (I live in NH). When I get to the Comcast service center I am told that their modems are for MA residents onlyŠ—_. Great. First Big issues.Finally, I get a Comcast modem back to my house, get it all set up and turn on my wi-fi devices. Not only do I experience the same problem, but now it is much, much worse. I reconnect my personal modem and call to have a tech come out to resolve the problem, this was on a Friday. They explained a tech would be out Monday to fix the problem, but the fun part is they could not give me ANY time frame, just Š—“sometime MondayŠ— and they will call before they show up.Monday comes around it's noon and still no word. I get on Comcast chat support and they assure me someone will be here as scheduledŠ—_ 4 oŠ—Èclock comes around, I get on Comcast chat, they assure me someone will be here as scheduled. No one ever showed. Now IŠ—Èm mad. First thing Tuesday morning I give Comcast a call. They never rescheduled an appointment after the one missed Monday, and they refuse to set me up a same day appointment. The only time he could offer me was Wednesday between 9am-12am (at least itŠ—Ès not a 24 hour window). He scheduled it and I told him I needed to talk to his manager, he understood and told me I would receive a call from his manager with 1-2 hours. The manager never called.On Wednesday morning I receive a voicemail from Comcast confirming my appointment for between 6pm Š—– 7pmŠ—_ What the actual **. 5:25pm comes around and the tech pulls up in front of my house, sits in his van for 35 minutes until 6pm (my two big dogs were not pleased). He comes in my house for about 10-15 minutes plugs his stuff into my modem, checked to make sure the wire wasnŠ—Èt loose and says it seems normal, and that they will be back the next day (Thursday) to replace the line from the telephone pole to my house. The guy literally did nothing else.All day Thursday no one cameŠ—_ surprise, surprise. Here we are today on Friday I get in touch with a person from Comcast, nothing was scheduled for anyone to come out to my location and resolve my issue. They tell me that I should expect a call from a tech to schedule another appointment. I won't hold my breath. Comcast has left a permanent bad taste in my mouth. This is literally the worst customer service I have EVER received. It is amazing your company is still in business."
"lucia of Richmond, VA",42578,1,"Comcast is by far the WORST cable company in America. They have the WORST customer service, the highest rip off fees, horrible customer service and fraudulent termination fees. The service is UNRELIABLE and they enjoy ripping you off. DO not sign up with them unless you want to pay high fees and get stressed out when you have irregular or no service for days, and they could care less. They enjoy tormenting you while you pay these exorbitant fees. I now have FIOS and have no problems. Comcast can go to hell, it sucks!"
"Georgiana of Jacksonville, FL",42576,1,"In June 2016, I went on a cruise to Alaska. I checked to be sure I would have internet access to check on my husband's severe heart condition and to provide support for my daughter who assumed caregiver responsibilities. I understood that weather and geographic location would affect service. Barring these conditions and in circumstances where 2 other carriers were able to connect swiftly and with stability, I was unable to do so. Returning home, I complained to Comcast and was told by Mr ** of their Executive Team that I should not expect good connections when traveling. He volunteered that he often had difficulties with his own service when he traveled to NY! My request for a credit of $175 (paid to Holland America for a satellite connection that worked for the people traveling with me but not for Comcast) was denied. I am angry b/c I was unable to provide the support I anticipated would be needed (it was) and planned to provide. The Comcast Executive Team has been very cavalier with this emotional end-of-life issue. I will be cancelling my service with them this week."
"Ross of Belmont, MI",42575,1,Comcast notified that they are going to start charging for a cable modem that I own. They are now trying to claim that they own it. They have done this to me off and on for the last 4 years. They make me fight and waste my time. I ask for a credit for the problems and they won't give me anything for the time I waste. How do you fight a company this big that does not care about their customers? I have heard this is a common problem with Comcast to scam their customers.
"Danirlle of Frederick , MD",42575,1,Comcast is the absolute worst... I make an appt to have cameras put up and upgrade my boxes. The rep made an appt for last Saturday. I got a call Saturday morning saying they couldn't make it because a tech wasn't available. I got a stupid $20 credit (which doesn't pay for the time I sat waiting) and scheduled for the following Saturday which is today. Well guess what? Got another call today after 11am saying that what... They can't make it again. This couldn't possibly mean what the new commercials are saying.They will work around our schedule not the other way around. Well for the 2nd weekend I have rearranged my schedule to accommodate them and they have for the 2nd weekend failed to meet that standard. I called 1800comcast and argued with them to let me talk to a manager. Manager finally calls me back only to transfer me to the billing dept only for them to have someone call me back again... Ugh. Maybe I should take my service and over payment on my account (they owe me money) and find somewhere that values their customers and holds their part of the bargain. Smh.
"andrew of Woods Hole, MA",42575,1,"Consistently, with the last couple of weeks (at least), I have had slow web page loading, download and upload speed, and poor reliability of packet/datagram transmission. I feel that they intentionally misrepresent their operational products and should be held accountable. Their patronizing customer service is apparently part of their policy to placate to cover for poor performance."
"Blane of Jacksonville, FL",42575,1,"My Comcast cable box last night went into de-programmed mode by itself and would only receive Spanish language, could not change it back to English, tried many times, reverted on its own with no help from Comcast. I had to take the box into the Comcast center today and get a new box and remote. Both had to be reprogrammed with about two hours to make the basics work. Then an hour or more on the phone with tech support. The channels with the X-1 new box do not match the old cable box channels.I need a channel guide with the actual channels and what is located on them (for local reception) sent to me in the mail so I can decrypt how things line up in HD. With just getting the box today (X-1), the remote does not operate as did the last one. So we are pressing the remote channel # that are not related to what we were previously watching seeing with the old remote. There is no set of instructions included on how to use the remote other than the basics and not instructions on how to troubleshoot problems. No user guide for the cable box. Just the box and the remote with electric cables.The person in tech support tried to help and provide but was not always clear on what was going on at my end (confused, possible language issue), and did not have a concept of the previous non-functioning box and this new one and the dissociation between the two, also the difference with the new remote which is not user friendly.My problem is that we pay near $240.00 a month for service that is poor with a phone system with delays, breaks in service, God help us if the power goes off, we are dead in the water, and an internet that is not as fast as published. The ping test says something else, that what we are seeing on our end with speed and consistency is not what they show in the test. The TV works but there are delays getting to channels and again it is not user friendly without any instructions, and a lack of a good channel guide that can be easily downloaded with the actual channels that are in our area. We think the service is too expensive for what we get and I cannot understand why the government with all the complaints that have been filed has not done something to get us rebates from Comcast since the cost is way more than I think it should be for what services we receive."
"Bob of Palmer Lake, CO",42572,1,"This is the worst company I have EVER dealt with! Their internet and TV are unworkable. Technical support is all in India. They do not understand anything. The phone system hangs up on you after telling you that your zip code has no service even though you are receiving service at that zip code. The most incompetent company on the face of the earth. From products to service, they are an abomination. Stay as far away from this company as you can!"
"James of Baltimore, MD",42567,2,"I have been going through this for over 2 years, maybe longer. I even went out and bought my own router to solve the problem, it didn't work. The problem started when I changed from DSL to Wireless Internet. I have been paying for high quality service, but I have suffered countless connection issues. I didn't call years ago, I simply plugged into a Ethernet cable to connect. Their records will show the numerous calls, however it will not show the calls never made, because tried to live with the problems. Meanwhile, as the need for wireless service has increased the problem is more noticeable. I feel I am due monetary compensation at this point, as I continue to pay for a reasonable level of internet service. Though numerous technicians have come to fix the problem, the problem currently exist. Please help!"
"Bhakyaraj of Chattanooga, TN",42567,1,Warning: Don't take xfinity internet service if you have an alternate option. There was an internet outage on Friday (7/15/2016) in my area. When called the customer service the automated message confirmed the outage and provided option for subscribing for notification when outage is resolved. Received notification by evening but unfortunately till today morning (7/16/2016) internet is not working.When contacted the customer service today morning (This is the worst part) they were not able to connect to my modem and should schedule an appointment with technician but they can't specify any time so I should wait in home for the entire day cancelling all my plans because they won't provide specific time for an appointment. WHAT THE??? If I can't be in home they will do it on Monday. Already I lost entire Friday without internet and two more days is completely unacceptable especially if your work requires internet. Xfinity has to improve their customer experience. It's way too behind compared to other providers. Unfortunately there is a tie up with the apartment so I can't take EPB. I had EPB in my previous apartment. It was awesome. Just plug and go. I had not faced any issue even once.
"Laura of Knoxville, TN",42564,1,"Comcast is the WORST company I have EVER dealt with. I have been trying for 3 weeks now to get service with them, because unfortunately they are the ONLY internet providers in our new neighborhood! Unless we want DSL which is impossible since I need the Internet for my work. I keep getting the runaround with this company and no one is properly trained with the correct information. Then their agents you contact who are in other states such as Illinois or Mississippi who tell you they are going to follow up on how service is coming along never do. Training of staff needs to be updated so that they are all on the same page instead of having techs who come to the house and tell you they cannot install inside because the cable hasn't been buried outside the new home and then contacting an agent on the phone who says ""yes they can install inside without the cable being buried"", or another agent who says ""oh, even if that tech had been on time he couldn't have done the work inside because the cable isn't buried yet"". All of this may have been avoided to begin with if the second agent I spoke with on the phone on June 24th had not dismissed my call telling her the house was a new construction to begin with and I was told may need to have line buried outside... To top it off when a tech came out to bury the line two weeks later we are told that who installed the fire hydrant crushed the cable pipe so now Comcast needs to contact 811 so they can mark where Comcast can bury the line as to not bust any pipes themselves. They tell us it will take 24-48 hours to do so, which would have been July 7th or July 8th and then he (the tech to bury the line) would be back that weekend, July 9th or 10th. Here we are a week from July 6th and 811 STILL had not been contacted to come out. I know this because I called them on July 10th myself as well as just now. Comcast is the WORST company I have dealt with! So if you have any other choice in your area, take it! I know I would."
"Cristina of Albuquerque, NM",42564,1,"The company is a nightmare to get something solved. Their Customer practice is unethical. For example, they first offer on the phone an XFinity Home (an alarm service for the house) as a free service included in the service. Then, when the workers come to install/fix the service, they bring an agreement of 2 years to sign. After that, it begins a nightmare of constant phone calls, asking you, ""Why do you cancel?"". In the meantime, the worker who came to fix/install your system can't go on working. Today, we spent more than 50 minutes, answering the same questions to 3 different Xfinity clerks trying to sell us more stuff. After that, you just want to get rid of them as quickly as possible: the phone clerks insist that they have to talk with the owner (you, looking your clock to rush somewhere) again, and again. Besides, at the point that you were able to have somebody in your house to just fix the speed of your internet service, you have talked to at least 10 persons, you even walked in their store, you still don't have anything solved, and your account climbs again because nothing that you agreed ""is in their system""."
"Zhe of Atlanta, GA",42564,1,"Xfinity (Comcast) increased my monthly charge without noticing me, and the internet becomes unusable (several disconnects per night). After I contact the customer service, they are willing to refund me for only less than half of the overcharged part."
"Lana of Rockville, MD",42563,1,"We are a small business. A customer is trying to get hold of us and they got a recording that our phone number via Comcast has been disconnected!!! Our phone is working just fine. I tested it by using my cell phone with a different area code to call the business number and it works fine. But my customer from Massachusetts was unable to get hold of me. Called Comcast and was put on hold forever. I also got a message that there is an outage in our area that affects our phone service. Comcast phone service and internet is pathetic. Internet is down at least once a week. Some day it will be on and off all day long. Unfortunately I could not switch to another carrier because the other carrier is Verizon and they are just as pathetic. Furthermore there is no Fios in our area from Verizon, a main city in MD, so we have to be stucked with Comcast."
"Jeffrey of Orlando, FL",42563,1,"After finding a rental charge on our bill, we looked at history going back at least a year and found that we were being charged for a modem rental fee ($10 per month) for a modem that we never requested or got from them. After requesting that our payment history be looked at by a supervisor (Derik **), I was told that the supervisor would call me back with their findings, (to which I never got a call back from). I am now being told that Comcast will only refund up to 90 days' worth of ""FRAUDULENT"" charges.Long story short... If they can RIP YOU OFF for more than 90 days, IT IS YOUR FAULT FOR NOT CATCHING THEM SOONER!! ""This is their company policy."" Should any rep from Comcast choose to respond or contradict this review, feel free to contact me or respond!! I am certain that they will not respond since they capitalize on you not watching your every bill, which is clear by their own policy!"
"Roni of Stayton, OR",42562,1,"I was a good customer for years. Recently, I called to move my service, as we were moving to a new house. Much to my dismay, I was told that Comcast doesn't service the area that I moved to, so, I was forced to get a different carrier. I was initially sad to lose the service, but there wasn't another option. I was told at that time that I would be receiving a refund check for 141.00 and some change. Ok. Great! Today, I got a call from their collections department asking for 98.00, due to the charge of an early termination fee in the amount of 210.00. WHAT??? So, I call Comcast (admittedly, I have NEVER liked calling them or dealing with their customer service department) and I waste about 45 minutes of my life on the phone arguing with them about this bogus charge.After several repeated conversations with their customer service representative, I finally got to a supervisor, ""Robert"". Robert offered to discount my bogus early cancellation fee by 50%. Now, that would be a great deal if I had actually broken my contract, but since COMCAST doesn't service my area, I don't really see how the break in my contract was on my end. I argued with Robert extensively about this bogus charge.After several minutes of intense conversation, in which they steadfastly refused to remove the bogus charge, and I assured them that I would spread the word regarding the business piracy tactics that they employ, I agreed to the 50% off of a ridiculous fee and will be getting a check for 7.02 instead of the 141.00 that I was supposed to receive. I would absolutely, under no circumstances, ever for any reason suggest that anyone go with Comcast for their cable or internet services. The service itself is nice, offering a lot of nice technology, but the customer service has been sorely lacking for the duration of my contract."
"Isabel of Memphis, TN",42562,1,"COMCAST/ Xfinity offers the worst customer service. I was paying $34 for the modem and my internet service. I wouldn't complain about the internet service going in and out because yes, it was inexpensive. Almost 12 months with them, I started receiving calls that my bill will go back to the normal price, $79.99, if I didn't change to another promotional price and added TV. I'm not a big fan of watching TV. Ok so I went ahead and picked a bundle for $49.99 a month. My services went off for 7 days when I saw 2 Xfinity men tampering with the Xfinity box outside of my residence. I called customer service, told them I was not going to pay my bill ahead if my services were not up and running. She said, ""I can send a technician to the residence to solve the problem at the cost $50."" I told her I'd rather cancel than pay someone to fix something 2 Xfinity employees tampered.She informed me that she can waive that fee. I said, ""ok if you're going to waive that fee then I'll pay my bill whenever I get my service restored."" 4 days later, I arrived home my service were restored. I called the next day to check on my bill and see if the service was waived and if I received a credit into my account for being off 7 days. They informed me that my bill was $33 so I went ahead and paid it. Month after that, my bill shows $141. I called and questioned them and they said that ""The fee wasn't waived, it's $99. We're sorry for who ever misinformed you but you still have to pay the fees.'' ""A sorry doesn't pay the bills,'' I said. She went ahead and said, ""we can credit half."" I said, ""ok we can do that."" I asked, ""So how much is my bill now?''. She said, ""$116."" ""That is not half off the service man, that's just 25% off. They told me it was $99 for the service man,"" and she said, ""That service man was $50. Sorry again for being misinformed. I'm just holding on the line."" In my mind these people don't know what to say anymore or what to lie about with Xfinity. I've always paid my bill a month ahead."
"Richard of Hanahan, SC",42562,1,"Comcast is literally the gold standard for horrific customer service! That is what they are most known for. The term ""Comcast bad"" is an actual term I have heard used in daily conversation regarding poor customer service. Until recently, I had never actually experienced it. The legend certainly lived up to the hype. It started when I was charged an extra $120 for exceeding my internet data usage cap that I didn't even know existed. Had I have known, I would have certainly curbed my usage or altered my service plan. I have been a Comcast customer for years and never had a data cap. Suddenly, my usage is being restricted to 300 gb a month. Anyone who uses Netflix will exceed that in 1 week. This is where the real issues began. I called to speak with a representative to discuss the new internet data cap which took being transferred to 4 different people (each person requiring me to spell out all of my personal info and give a description of my issue). The customer rep I finally spoke to was extremely dismissive of my issue and told me I was informed though my Comcast provided email about the new policy. Ultimately, I requested to add unlimited data for an additional $35 a month to avoid any further charges until I could go through all of my mail to see if I had actually been notified. I wasn't. Then my next bill came and I had a $160 internet cap overage fee. I called Comcast yet again. I began my call at 11:30 am and didn't finish until 7 pm. Throughout that time, I was transferred to dozens of reps (again having to spell out all of my personal info and give a description of my issue to each of them). Every time I was making progress, I would be placed on hold and my call would get disconnected. This happened five times! It is unbelievably frustrating to have to call the basic customer service line and providing every detail about you, your account, and your issue to someone you knew was going to just transfer you to do it all over again with someone else who can't help you. It takes a good 4 or 5 times of getting transferred until you get someone who isn't reading from a script. Throughout that time I did speak with someone who was able to verify that I should have had unlimited service, and also revealed that the Comcast provided email address they sent my notifications to was not even mine. I got 1 of the 2 charges resolved before the fifth time I was disconnected. At that point I literally thought, I would rather pay $120 than have to call Comcast again."
"Patrick of Stow, OH",42561,1,"This should have been a 5 minute process. I should have been able to send a simple email to the Comcast customer service group requesting that my service be turned off at the end of this month. But Comcast does not conduct business via email, so I decided to give their poor chat session a try to see if that would fulfill my needs. Needless to say, it did not. The poor girl was so poorly trained, that I thought that she might have a serious problem with the English language or was possibly dyslexic. Every time I would send a question her way, she would either ignore it, or give me a answer that had nothing to do with my question. Eventually I gave up and when I attempted to print out the entire conversation so I could actually post it here, I could only get the first page of the conversation to print out. Unbelievable. So you will have to trust me when I say that Comcast is quite possibly the worst cable provider on the face of the earth and please do not use them if you can avoid them. I had to use them as they were the only provider in my apartment community in Lynchburg VA.I would also like for everyone to know that even getting into a chat session on a Sunday morning at approximately 11:00 a.m. also took several attempts on my part. The browser states that your chat will begin shortly but after waiting over 10 minutes watching the stupid little lines spin, and spin, and then spin some more, I jumped out and tried to get back in via a different topic. After about 2 more minutes of spinning lines, I finally got the most incompetent representative ever in my 60 years of life on planet earth. Bottom line. If you can avoid Comcast I would highly recommend it. I will not try to point you in a direction towards any other cable provider, but if I can get at least 1 family/person not to sign up with Comcast I feel that this endeavor was worth my time and effort. Can one voice make a difference? YES IT CAN."
"Chongo of Lilburn, GA",42561,1,"I went in to trade in my old DVR for a newer one. I waited for a whole hour before being called to see a service rep. She asked me what I was there for even though she knew full well what I was there for. I told her I was there to exchange my DVR. I told her I wanted a regular HD DVR not an X1. At this point all I wanted was to get what I came for and go home. I knew the whole point of keeping customers in there was to sell them more products. I cut to the quick and told her exactly what I wanted. She asked 'why, have you tried the X1 before?' Clearly trying to make a sales pitch. When I told her to just give me what I asked for her whole attitude changed and she became rude and sullen. Started slamming things on the counter. She fished out a DVR set behind her and printed out a receipt for me to sign. I signed it and I was set. The whole encounter took less than 5 minutes. Why was I in there for an hour for a transaction that took less than 5 minutes to complete? I HATE COMCAST. Your customer service SUCKS! You pretend to be all about your customers but all you're about is the bottom line. You've closed most your service centers, left only a few open causing massive backlogs. You've outsourced your telephone service reps out to China or wherever the hell those people are. I know they're not in the US. You SUCK Comcast. I will definitely NOT be renewing my contract when it's up next year."
"anonymous of Duluth, KY",42559,1,"Crap, just plain crap. Their internet suck and I pay too much ** money to get this result. When I'm in the farthest room the internet is really, really pissy and I'm considering a ** switch. Also I've got the UNLIMITED data plan, and at the end of the reset time the speed of the internet gets crappy as hell which it shouldn't but I know that if it's at the beginning of the reset time that the internet is fast but usually it's been really ** pissy and often the service has been going down a lot. Overall don't waste your money on this ** horrible internet."
"Bernard of Houston, TX",42557,1,"While my entire relationship with Comcast has been nothing short of a nightmare today absolutely takes the cake and forces me to take pen in hand and vent my frustration with this company. For the last 2 years we have had nothing but trouble with our service but in the last 2 months it has been so bad that we have lost internet service on a regular basis and 2 weeks ago completely, this despite numerous visits from various technicians.Today due to a problem with our DVR box, it crashes every 5 minutes or so, we scheduled an appointment for a replacement. The tech shows up after getting lost only tell us that he had no DVR box on his truck and in fact had no idea that that was the reason for the visit. My wife told him to go get out and go home. Apparently he contacted his supervisor who told him to use whatever he had in his truck to replace our unit, which he did. That did not work and he told us he had to go get the correct unit and would return shortly, that was over 2 hours ago and no sighting so far. So we called Comcast to find out what the deal was and we're told that they were looking for him but he was MIA, his department was closed and no one was available.This is a chronic problem in that after calling, waiting, being put on hold, no one ever reads the notes, so when they arrive for the appointment they are clueless why they are even there. Wasting your time is of no consequence to them. Taking pride in their service is not on the radar of this company. ""Sign you up move you on"" should be their motto."
"cindy of Ann Arbor, MI",42557,1,The wifi signal is really really bad.
"jomeyda of Ventura, CA",42556,1,"Comcast has an extremely poor customer service. Several phone calls to Comcast on 2015 asking for my security deposit. Is July 2016 and I'm still waiting. They said on the last phone call, Rep. 1: ""You need two more weeks."" Rep. 2: ""The money is in your bank account"" (Lie). Rep. 3: ""We need the account number or the last amount been paid because you have a confirmation number about the issue but I need more info."" Why Comcast don't want to resolve this little problem? Comcast just don't want to do the right thing. Comcast has a very poor customer service."
"Thomas of Miami, FL",42555,1,Took 3 times for them to install the system. First week or so was ok after that internet cut out all the time. Every time you call they have your phone number programmed in and it is a machine says they are having difficulties in your area. On Demand hardly ever works. Will start and stop by itself. You try and fast forward through commercials and it will keep going for a couple of minutes before resuming normal. Try and go back is the same thing. It is useless to have a forward or reverse. When you call they say have to speak to a different department.
"Martin of Alexandria, VA",42554,1,"Where to start... I guess it's due to the monopoly that they have no reason to service customers. I moved into a Xfinity-only area and after 2 days, I could not be more dissatisfied. I've experienced no less than 5 errors, 2 related to channel lineup, 2 related to erroneous overbilling. (It's never underbilling is it?!) The most hilarious tale of incompetence was when they added a $10 charge for a rented modem when I added channels and I called to ask them to remove it as I own my own modem - instead of removing the charge, they added a second charge just for kicks. (As if I had 2 rented modems!!) I called back and the agent this time said he can't authorize it and he's submitted a ticket which will take 7-10 days to correct. He also suggested I call back before 7 days because 'this process isn't perfect!' I wish I had any other option than Comcast but they have a monopoly here. About time that changed."
"Chris of Scranton, PA",42551,1,"I don't even know where to start. Well I got Comcast internet hooked up in 2012 and besides little issues I never had a problem UNTIL March of 2015! I have had about 30 modem/routers hooked up in my home always the same continuous problem. Speeds are fine, 0 packet loss, but the one major problem is my ping times are reaching 200-300 ms at random times. It took me 3 calls to corporate office to finally get their asses moving last June and it took them up to the end of October to finally find a massive noise (SNR) issue in the lines. Since Nov 8th of 2015 my cable internet has been garbage. I cannot play any online games on the Xbox one, ports opened, tried DMZ, tried everything you could possibly think of including spending $800 of my own money to buy the best modem router combo, still didn't work. I filed a complaint with the FCC and Comcast said they did everything possible to help me. Everything? Yeah not really. If they did everything I would be able to play with lag-free gaming with 170mbps down and 12 mbps up. The higher-up guy at Comcast sent me a letter stating there's nothing else they can do, so what am I supposed to do now? It is the only ISP in my major area besides Verizon DSL and who wants 2mbps dl that's terrible! As of today June 30, 2016 I have just hooked up their brand new Arris gateway and running constant tracer routes and ping test and am still seeing ping going as high as 350ms. I contacted corporate office today and they said basically ""you pay the money, we do nothing to fix your issue because our techs ran a speed test"". LMAO a speed test WOW! These people just ** on you and they don't care! They did offer to send another tech to run a speed test but I would get charged if they didn't find anything. So I'm basically stuck paying for blast internet and can just search the web on my laptop. Awesome, I got Comcast screwed."
"N. of Lawrenceville, GA",42551,1,"I don't wish Comcast on my worst enemy!! I really believe they try to get customers and after 3 months when the contract is ""official"" this is when all the problem pops up. So I signed up with Comcast for internet and cable. I explained to the representative that I am working with a budget and I will like to hear options and best offer. Fast forward...the package I chose was $113.00 keeping in mind it was almost the end of the month and they charged me for the entire month. A week passed by. I got another bill for the upcoming month. Okay cool. I paid it thinking my cycle be said amount from now on. After my three months passed I got a letter in the mail stating that I was not charged for one of the boxes, therefore, they will have to add it to my bill. My bill went up to 126.00! I called to express my disappointment and disgust but you know the representative will be reading that script and keep saying, ""I am sorry. I understand,"" to me. No!! You don't understand!! We had a verbal agreement!! Anyway nothing was done on their end to make me happy. I paid my bill. Next month I got my bill. It was $139.00. I was irate. I called again. Same crap about increase and taxes, and the whole works. Next month was $169.00. Some guy said my service was disconnected and it wasn't. I paid my bill and the customer representative I spoke with said he will waive the charge. He assured me that he just did it and my bill will be $110 next cycle. Well my bill came around and it's $134.00. I called again and another rep is telling me taxes went up and blah, blah...Well Comcast never disappoint. I went to check my mailbox today. Got a letter stating that I've been provided high definition and was not being charge for it. As a result they will be disconnecting it on the 28th July or I can add it for $9.99. The letter was so unprofessional. No dates. It wasn't signed. It was very vague. As usual their customer rep couldn't help but just poured out a bag of crap and said to me they gave me the wrong box. These people cannot be serious. I wish I read the reviews before I signed up. As a result my advice to people considering going with Comcast: Please reconsider!!"
"Ron of Woodstock, GA",42551,1,"A couple years ago we had a few service issues with Xfinity and as recompense they upgraded our service from basic to HD for free. It went away without any warning and when I called and asked why, was told that we weren't paying for it. Told them why we were getting it and the response was that there wasn't anything noted on the account."
"Kate of North Charleston, SC",42548,1,"$700 bill. Really! If I could not give any stars I would. Change from AT&T to Comcast, worst decision ever. Only my child of 4 years, my husband and I use it. We barely home. And my husband only use when he has to check his laptop! That is just ridiculous! Please don't trust Comcast that's all I can say. "
"bshoff1968@comcast.net of Everett, WA",42545,1,"I have recently dumped Comcast after 20 plus years of having an account with them and watching my bill triple and inch up almost monthly. When I call, they always give me the ""I see you are a loyal customer and here's what I'm gonna do for you"" spiel. This last time, my bill jumped almost $40 a month. When I called, the gentleman said I needed the new equipment so he would send someone out to replace it free of charge. Then, my bill came and it had done up another $28 with the new equipment. Telling my story of woe to several people, they all pretty much said the same thing. We could have kept our old equipment so I called to tell them to bring it back. Talking to the operator, she said they could come and get the new equipment but my bill would stay the same as with the new equipment AND, I would be charged $39.99 for the service call. Beyond frustrated as this went on for 3 weeks and the first appt. for a service rep didn't happen. He just did a no show. Long story short, we cancelled cable and landline and now only have them for Internet and that will change so. As well but first need to acquire a different one and change email address with all who currently have my Comcast one. We are now streaming with Apple TV and feel liberated from ""The Man"" we are also saving almost $1500 a year."
"James of Richmond, VA",42545,1,"The service is garbage, much like the competence of the representatives. Here's my story. First, they changed my billing cycle to make it 3 weeks earlier than when was initially discussed, and naturally this was without warning. So of course I'm confused when my service gets shut off. When I call to straighten this out I find out they bounced the last two checks I made out to them. I decide to cut my losses, pay the balance, and I return their gear the following week. I instructed them to send me the final bill for that week of service. Instead, they send it straight to collection. With the wrong amount. They want almost $50 for that final week? Talk about being bitter over losing a customer. So now I have to deal with this and all of its obscurity.Comcast: I will be disputing this. My bank statements prove what you're doing is extortion. I wonder where you came up with this magical number. No, really, because it's made up. Mess with my credit again and you can expect a lawsuit. And anybody reading this: I advise you to stay far away from this joke of a provider. Not cause I'd die for Verizon or anything like that but because of what's been dealt to me."
"Jean of Albuquerque, NM",42545,1,"When testing speed on Comcast/Xfinity in morning it's 2.60 Mbps and at night it's 1.59 Mbps upload. Download in morning it's 5 Mbps but not enough to stream Netflix and it should be and in evening it's on from 8:30-9:30pm and OFF every night, the download speeds are 1.4 Mbps. There is no reason for such bad speed as I live in the city near the access wi-fi points. They charge you for 10 Mbps and you never get that speed. We have it set up at 405 and I am in 407 a tiny house, two bedroom, duplex stand alone house. CS just hangs up on you and they cannot help you. They blame it on where your modem is placed and I worked for a Cable-Internet company. I know a lot about Modem/Routers. We would change internet providers only it costs too much money to pay for just the hook up. We're seniors being ripped off in Albuquerque."
"Zulma of Weston, FL",42544,1,In the complex we live the phone/internet and TV company was being added. The new company is Comcast. We were assured that if in the installation process any damage would our properties by them will be fixed. Comcast damaged our sprinkler's system which resulted in loss of grass and one section which resulted in loss of water pressure and no sprinkler service for a section of the property. We called the association a couple of times and we were assured this issue was forwarded to Comcast. We spoke to Comcast twice and they said the would address it. In the mean time to prevent further damage we had to replace our sprinklers system.
"Mark of Lansdale, PA",42542,1,"I signed up for the triple play with Comcast in July of 2015. It took them until the end of September to have me fully installed, inconvenient but it works. Or does it? My cable is fine, my phone goes out (doesn't work at all) a few times and my Internet/WiFi is consistently inconsistent. There are multiple times when I can not get out to the internet at all. This stayed the same all the way until May 2016. During that time I made numerous phone calls (over 60) and spoke with tier 1, tier 2 and WiFi specialists. I had over 15 techs come out to my house and do everything from moving the modem to changing my cable coming into my home to adding filters to hard wiring my gaming systems. None of this worked, my internet remained up and down. I asked more than once why they didn't switch out the modem and was told it's rarely a problem. So basically I was paying for a service that didn't always work and to make matters more frustrating, I was told there was no supervisor or manager I could speak with to discuss my problems until the problem was fixed. In late May I finally convinced them to switch the modem and bang it now works. Still not as fast as Verizon, but it works. So I call them to discuss what will be done for my months of crappy service. The tier one person is very nice and understanding and writes up a ticket to partially reimburse me for my bad service. She tells me it needs to go to management for approval - the same management I was not allowed to speak with when I had a problem. Management looks at my ticket and denies it, stating that the previous three months May, April and March my internet usage was higher than normal households. Now I have two teenagers who connect their phones to my WiFi, we have a gaming system, their friends are always over using the WiFi for their phones, I need to connect to the internet for work and school. So yes we use the internet and we used it those months. I asked to speak with the management who made this decision and I was told I can not. I asked them to simply let me out of my contract and let me leave their piece of crap company and I was denied that as well. I for one am tired of large companies thriving and making money off of us the consumer, who without us they would not exist. Once my contract is up I will never go back to them, ever. I beg you to do the same. Do not switch to them and if possible, leave them immediately. Thanks!"
"Andrey of Corte Madera, CA",42542,1,"For a couple years I've used Comcast as my internet service, they have raised the price and I moved to another company. I have cancelled Comcast service on March 8th, 2016 and got a confirmation email. On March 22nd I received an email from Comcast saying $106.66 is due on April 10th. Then I call Comcast and they say the auto payment was not turned off and that is why I was charged, so they said I should get the money back within a week or so. Seemed like a done deal. More than two weeks pass and I have not seen a refund on my credit card. I call second time and now was told that a physical check will be sent to my address, I should expect it on May 4th (this time I got a confirmation number and extension of who I spoke with). May 4th comes, and nothing, I did not receive a check. I call third time trying to reach Clark but he doesn't pick up, in fact, as I recall an automated voice said this extension is not valid. I call 4th time, now recording this conversation, and I was clearly told the check will arrive in a week. That did not happen. I call 5th time and was told the check will arrive June 20th, today, and still no check or refund on my credit card. I have wasted SO MUCH TIME I could've used elsewhere. Beware."
"bob of Lodi, NJ",42542,1,"I would rather spend the next ten years of my life breaking rocks in a Turkish prison than have Comcast.

"John of Gaithersburg, MD",42541,1,Their internet is spotty at night. Their customer service is rude and they don't care about anything but a paid bill. I switched from Verizon to them and I can openly say that Verizon is worth the money. You get what you pay for and Comcast is cheap and bad!!
"Joel of Minneapolis, MN",42541,1,"Very dishonest. Cancelled my service and they kept charging me for 2 subsequent months. Called and they said ""refund check in the mail"". Refund check never arrived. Called again 3 months later (after the 2 subsequent months) and they said I had early termination fees (which is never listed on the bank account summary-only the two monthly charges are listed). And I was not even under a contract. Just keep making up fees to not issue the refund."
"Christopher of Sacramento, CA",42539,1,I pay for the top tier of internet in my area which is 120mbps. I am happy whenever I can get over 80mbps. Most of the time I am averaging around 5mbps on a wired connection. This is without their hotspot router. Currently I have 2.88mbps coming in hardwired. According to them they have no control over this. This is unacceptable. How is it that the cable portion always comes in perfect but your internet on the same cable goes in and out. Then they want to charge $50 to send someone out to look at the problem. Too bad they are the only option I have available to me as I am in an apartment. This is the definition of a monopoly.
"Uzi of Germantown, MD",42538,1,"By far the worst company in the world! From the technicians, customer service, and service itself. I have too many details to share which I don't feel like getting into but stay away! If you have other options in your area like FIOS for example, go with them. I hope they go out of business. One thing I will share though... One of the technicians who came to my house broke my TV stand and let it sit on two speakers to keep it upright... I didn't notice until a few days later... Can you believe that? Also, they are notorious for charging you randomly for random things. The internet speed is NEVER what you pay for. Unfortunately, I am stuck with them for now until I move because my area has limited providers. Save yourself the trouble. Choose someone else."

So I canceled."

"Carolyn of St. Louis Park, MN",42536,1,"I am unable to comprehend how this company has survived with the poor communications skills within the company yet alone to the consumer. I was reeled in with a ""good deal"" and have already spent 2 visits to the location that ""set up service"", 8 phone calls and 132 minutes of my time trying to get my service started. I have not been told the same ""truth"" more 2 times out of all these calls. They do not even know the procedure when you have to disconnect from another carrier. First you are told they will do it, then you are told you must disconnect. After that they tell ""oh you have to tell them you want the phone number ported."" Too Late!! The phone is already disconnected and now you have to pay to have it reconnected, wait 3 days and then it can be ported to Xfinity. Then they go back to we get the phone disconnected. I have already been without service for days and it looks like it will be at least another week before anything is resolved. Also note the representatives are in the Philippines- they farm out the work from America. I am so disgusted. The grass was definitely NOT greener. I would rate them in the negative if I could."
"Brian of Bellevue, WA",42535,1,"They sent out 2 techs and still cannot fix. Both Xfinity Wi-Fi 2.4 and 5 GHz are intermittent. 10 seconds on by 2 seconds off Š—– constantly. My download speed is great at 170 mbps and up is 15, which is good but the Wi-Fi sucks! Probably due to using splitter for both PC & TV. Only solution I've read is to buy your own compatible router which I will do so to lose the $10 lease fee."
"Steve of Commerce Township, MI",42534,1,There are so many hidden fees with Xfinity and I am being charged 500 for canceling early. I have been in my home for two years and they said I had a three contract and could do nothing to help me out. They offer a fitness channel for $2.99 but it actually costs you $30 a month with a minimum of three months and they will not reimburse you at all. Their customer service is awful and very condescending. Quality on streaming tv shows is very poor.
"ALEX of Boca Raton, FL",42533,1,Comcast - The really horrible for the past two month. I hate Comcast. Work on the Internet is impossible. Constantly the connection is lost. Speed - badly - 2-20 mb and should - 80 mb. 2 times messed up my purchases with http://o-vegas.com/ site.
"Richard of Tamarac, FL",42532,1,I bought some electronics that I needed to hook up to my Comcast wifi and it's two days of constant punishment trying to reset my password. I was online at least 3 hours yesterday and half of the day today and it's starting to look like I will never be able to reset my password. I dislike Comcast more than any company I have ever had to deal with. For such a simple task as resetting a password they actually have no clues on how to help a person with this. I can promise you I am going to dump these clowns as quickly as I can. They promise you the world to sign you into a 2 year contract and then can't even help you reset a simple password. Please take my advice and don't fall for these con artist.
"Tania of Colorado Springs, CO",42530,1,"I was recently told by a customer service person that when I am behind on my bill, that Comcast DELIBERATELY slows down my internet speed. Here's the thing: they are getting me coming AND going. I have bipolar depression and don't always catch problems with my bill. I can understand their charging a late fee OR slowing down the speed, but not both. Why? Because EVERY SINGLE TIME I have been behind on my bill, I have caught up. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Yet I receive NO refund for their decrease in internet speed. Where I come from? That's called Robbery."
"K. N. of Mount Prospect, IL",42529,1,"I have had Comcast/Xfinity for many years, and was always satisfied. Since they changed to their ""X1"" offering, my internet service is awful. I go for a week or longer with very slow and unresponsive internet service; then for a week or 2 it is great, as it used to be. When I have gone to check my Comcast email, I have not only not been able to get to it, they have flashed a message on the screen ""unable to connect - server has been changed"". If this is not straightened out by the end of my commitment, I will be changing providers! I never had any issues until they started ""X1"". When I complained about missing emails completely for over 2 1/2 weeks (I have a digital newspaper subscription) a customer service rep had the audacity to tell me my missing emails, ON THEIR SERVERS, were due to the inside wiring in my home!? Just how stupid do they think the public is?!"
"Brenda of Shreveport, LA",42528,1,Let's start by saying I've been with Comcast for over 2 years because there is no other service I can get here or else I would have been gone. By far the worst customer service. If you call in make sure you have water and a Tylenol close. You will have a migraine by the time the call is done with. 9/10 the person does not speak clear English and they are literally reading from something. 9/10 they're rude. Another 9/10 your issue won't be resolved. And finally the icing on the cake for me is the $450 past due fee I have because of their cheap systems. The issue has yet to be resolved. And they claim they refunded my last two payments but can't tell me where the money went and keep saying it's my bank's fault (I've called the bank and they've assured me that Comcast is most definitely responsible). By the way this is the 3rd time dealing with this issue and it always ends up being their fault. Mind you all the while I have to go weeks without service. It's horrible in a nutshell.
"Mary ann of Cape Coral, FL",42528,1,"I'm going to lose my mind. How do you get any help with these companies? The worst customers service. I have called over 14 times was, they suppose to have a 30 day cancellation policy. I'm being charged over 200.00 for slow internet that should be 19.99 if you do paperless billing but charged 29.99 and late fees. Only had T.V. service for 4 days. Canceled service. Brought back all equipment, now have a bill for over 200.00. I've called numerous times. On hold for over 15 to 20 minutes, then they disconnect call. I was told by a Victor he would get back to me to give him the opportunity to clear this. Haha. He never called. How can it be allowed to do this?? So what do you do?? I can't get to talk to any competent person, and I don't want my credit affected. I will gladly pay for what I use, but I'm being ripped off. I wish I never called them in the first place. It was all lies. The worst customers service."
"Holly of Anderson, IN",42528,1,"I hate Comcast. I have been a customer for over 5 years now. I HATE them. We have been having issues with the internet intermittently going out on us since we moved about four years ago. I call them and they do a quick fix (a week or so before the problems come back) and they always say that it is the old modem or router. We replaced the router multiple times and the modem is new. Something is obviously wrong with either the lines or just Comcast in general.They won't fix the problem. The only other option in my area is AT&T, but the installation costs are expensive. I am about ready to just cancel Comcast and go back to the dark ages. I am THAT angry. I am SO FED UP. There have been some customer service reps that were as helpful as they could be, but, obviously, this is an issue that Comcast has and just refuses to resolve. If you are considering Comcast, STOP. It isn't worth it. Go with ANYONE else. Please. Save yourself the pain. Comcast, I hate you just so very much."
"Curtis of Memphis, TN",42526,1,"We have been a long standing Comcast customer. First it was the double billing. Tried to arranged the cycling time frame where it would fall at a different time frame did not work. Second issue was the phone - it suddenly cut off in midstream of a conservation. It kept happening and they kept trying to fix the issue so we decided to upgrade our land line phones. And last the past two weeks there has been numerous outages in the zip code 38133 so patiently waiting for service to be establish on. Yesterday June 4, 2016 - it took four hours, 4 - 8:5 pm and was notified via phone the service was back on. Got to check and guess what? Partial service, phone and internet but no Network. So as of this morning I do not know whose internet network service I am using! It was stated by two technicians it was the modem it is outdated. Well it was working prior to low but working! We receive a notice a few months ago to upgrade via XFINITY site to receive a new modem. Never could get that to work, tried several times! For an additional charge the Technician could come out and make the switch. I feel it is up to your company to supply new uncharged equipment not the customer. Now I have to make a trip to the satellite location to turn old modem for a new! Since I had a minor procedure on Friday was not up to traveling but now I must! The phone and two IPADs is connected to my Network so only the main computer is operational. This was incompetence at the highest but I must give credit to the agent since he was insistent on selling me a package. Could you imagine if I had bundle everything with you I would have no electronic service this morning! I will no longer be Comcast customer. This is the last straw! "
"JONATHAN of Jacksonville, FL",42518,1,"I was overbilled for 6 months. At the end of each month I went to the Xfinity store to speak directly with a rep. Each time, I was told my account would be credited and calibrated, but it never was right. Finally I spent two and a half hours putting all charges and payments into a spreadsheet to make the account crystal clear. I brought it to the store and again I was promised everything would be calibrated. When it wasn't, I again pleaded my case and was told nothing more could be done. Essentially, I was robbed of $60. After all the hours I spent going to the store, waiting in queue and talking to reps, I gave up because $60 wasn't worth personal and family time. Xfinity has a monopoly in high-speed internet in my area so they don't really need to do anything because we don't have a choice but to deal with them. Pretty sick."
"alina of Rehoboth Beach, DE",42518,1,"I had a plan with Comcast only for the internet, high speed blast. I ran a internet speed check to see how fast it is, as I was noticing slower and slower internet connection. It was the very minimum speed, at 0.61 mb/ sec.... unbelievable... and my plan was for high speed blast internet speed. This is theft! I was paying for a high speed and what I was getting was not even 1 mb/ sec. Comcast is a joke. Check your speed internet from while to while. Also the customer service is very bad too."
"Ann of Ft. Myers, FL",42517,1,"Their customer service is without a doubt the WORST I've ever dealt with. This is not the actual office, but the customer service reps via a phone. I have dealt with them for 4 weeks trying to get a refund on an over-bill and it took a complaint to the Better Business Bureau. I had called several times, got seven different ""ticket numbers"" and each time a guarantee of refund within 48 hours. Mind you, two of my calls were to supervisors. What you get is a foreigner with scripted lines, who tell you what you want to hear (and no satisfaction). Once I contacted the BBB I got IMMEDIATE satisfaction. I was contacted three times within 4 hours and my account was credited. I would like to share the Executive's phone number: **. I have no doubt the next time I put my account on ""vacation mode"", I will go through the same **."
"samira of Boynton Beach, FL",42515,1,Worst services ever. There's always a power outage. Bill is unpredictable for same services. They can't help you when you need it the most. Big mistake.
"Chester of Trevose, PA",42515,1,"I was a Comcast customer for over 25 years. Within the last year I was waiting for Comcast to adjust my bill. They sent it to a collection agency for 327.50. I paid it off in full 2 days, later the balance was 0. 3 days later it said I was 189 past due. I called customer service and I told them how can I be 189 past due when it was sent to a collection agency and I paid in full. They said I'd have to pay it, I said no way. A month later they sent me a bill for over 500. I finally got a honest customer service person. She said I was being charged about 220 for unreturned equipment. I had a paper with the Comcast workers employee number showing I returned it. She did a little time researching it and notice another time they billed me for equipment I returned so if you took off the 220 twice and the 189 I would have a credit. I always return my equipment so I don't get charged for it. I tried for months for them to fix my bill. They said they would and never did. They never did so I refused to pay it for the last 10 months. I use a antenna. I miss my cable and internet but I'm not paying for their mistakes."
"T of Marietta, GA",42513,1,"We sold our home and moved in with a friend, Comcast/Xfinity has charged us $140 for cancelling our service. They say this is because we did not transfer the service to our new location - we DO NOT have a new location! I want a refund of this $140."
"Dave of Any, CA",42508,1,"The more Comcast proclaims to put the customer first the more hollow it is. We researched ISPs in our area and decided to go with Comcast. They tried their best to hook us into their bundled service which is such a good deal, for a year, then it becomes a new car payment forever. They couldn't activate it for over a week later and wouldn't give us a time window. The day came and went and no call, no email, no internet. Now we had to wait 3 more days. Again no time window. I know why they are so expensive. So they can run all those commercials trying to convince us that all of our experiences over the years of disappointments over appointments has change. Well headline: IT HASN'T."
"carol of Sacramento, CA",42508,1,They demanded over 100.00 dollars for service which they could not provide upfront. Now they are refusing to refund that money. They are not to be trusted and I am now calling the BBB. I gave them this money in good faith to install internet for my son. Now they refuse to refund the money that we had to put onto 2 different credit cards. I have been going in circles now for over 2 weeks. They promise we will have it within 48 hours and they lie and do nothing. The money was all my son had and chose to go without a lot to get service. Now he has not only no food or way to get around as he is disabled and Comcast keeps his money. They talked to me 4xs with no problem. Now today they have an issue?
"Elsa of Oakley, CA",42505,1,I've had Comcast for over a year and my internet has gone down several times. I find myself calling their technical support at least 3 times a week because my internet connection doesn't work. From paying $50 a month it's gone up to 100 a month and I only get my internet working for less that half the time. Plus yesterday one of their agents shared my personal information with a family member that's not in my account. Which I believe is illegal. I'm the only person on this account but they thought it was ok to share my information with another person.
"Sarah of Marietta, GA",42504,1,"We pay on time. We pay a lot of money. We HAVE HORRIBLE INTERNET CONNECTION. Intermittent, slow, terrible. We call the company to attempt to get it fixed and they do nothing. They have horrible customer service and literally offer no helpful solutions. They are robbing us. It's insane. yet, they have a monopoly on internet service in our area, which is even more frustrating. I just lost an hour's worth of graphic design work. I work from home, so this is especially frustrating. AVOID THIS HORRIBLE EXCUSE OF A COMPANY AT ALL COSTS IF YOU CAN!! "
"marquis of Goose Creek, SC",42502,1,"So I've been with Comcast since November 2015 and have never had to call for any reason especially since I'm self sufficient with any electronics that come in and out of my home. I had to Call 4 times alone today, about a call I receive from Comcast on Monday about my account. Seems like calls are not monitored for q&a purposes, they do a very poor job at leaving notes, and clearly your system has been compromised. I have not signed my name and number to anything since signing up with them months ago for anything, and I received a fraud call from a rep claiming to work at Comcast's payment dept in Connecticut, requesting my information.After speaking with the reps today, not only was there no documentation of the call but the very last rep stated they no longer OB calls to customers for payment arrangements since April of this year. Never received a notice about it nor have I ever fallen behind before. The experience the CSR reps provide is clearly bottom of the barrel. Sorry to say, but I work for T-Mobile. I am a top performer and provide phenomenal customer service to any customer that calls. Hints: why we are ranked #1 JDP amongst all carriers. And I expect the same when I call. And just an FYI: for the superiors responsible for training the reps this way make sure you also remember: ""no customers, no pay checks"". Without ""us"" there is no ""you"".I understand why this company has ranked the very bottom 7 consecutive years, and for that reason the pay will always be poor for the reps and the company Will either go under due to loss of revenue or just barely floating above water. Know that customers like I will gladly pay the extra $10 for the same service with someone else for a better experience."
"EDITH of Rockford, IL",42500,1,"You use their modem, you get charged $10 every month. Still you don't have good connection and can't use the Internet if you not buy the modem. You pay for a 75mega bytes speed, you get less than 30, you get upset and tired of calling them everyday and decide to buy your own modem and router. You mess up your speed even more and with on and off Internet connection and when you call them, they tell you it's your router (that are very new) or your laptop that is just 3 days old. I can't seem to use any other company here because Comcast monopolized the service here in Rockford IL."
"Breana of Ann Arbor, MI",42491,1,"They are the worst company to deal with for internet services. Avoid them at all costs. They told me one price, and I got an email for a different price. They told me that I could set up one way, and then told me I cannot do it that way. Their customer service is literally the worst I have ever experienced. If there was another option I would not continue services, but they are the only company that services my address. WORST COMPANY EVER. 100% do not recommend."
"RJ of Houston, TX",42488,1,"It seems that their system is not robust and actually quite fragile. Each time it rains the cable internet service goes out and it takes days to fix. They must not know how to learn how to make the service reliable for some reason. I'm running two businesses and Internet trading and can't do anything when service is out... using a phone is not a good option. For a company this big, it's surprising to me that they can't get a handle on robustness and reliability."
"Paul of Springfield, MA",42485,1,"Been dealing with a nightmare at Comcast for at least 3 years now. I pay $90 a month for high-speed internet and receive half the speed I pay for. I have to keep calling there for them to turn my internet speed up. Then my service works good for a few days and it's right back down again. I've been through modems, wireless internet boxes, and still nothing but problems. They are no doubt in my mind throttling back on internet service."
"Papa of College Park, GA",42483,1,"This review is about the Xfinity internet service we currently have. We signed up with Xfinity 2 months ago as we left AT&T. That was our biggest mistake for the year 2016. Indeed, at the time we were signing up, nobody made us aware of the 300 GB limitation. Xfinity will allow you to go over your 300 GB 3 times as a ""courtesy"", and thereafter you will be charged $10.00 for any overage of 50 GB. The people at Xfinity I talked to over the phone today were very uncomfortable explaining this to me. One of them (a manager) even told me that there were no limitations to the use of the internet (300 GB do not sound like a limit to him). He also said that AT&T has a limit of 200 GB which was very inaccurate (we left AT&T 2 months ago). The Xfinity individual I talked even tried to sell me a deal of unlimited internet if I agreed to pay $35.00 more. I will tell all my contact about this highway robbery, and very funny way of doing business."
"Shanna of Jacksonville, FL",42477,1,"Comcast/Xfinity is by far the worst Cable & Internet provider ever. I completely agree with the reviews, because they are indeed accurate and this I know because I'm a customer who regrets signing up for service. I work from home and I'm constantly calling Comcast to report Internet problems such as: slow connections although I'm paying for the fastest and highest one that have. My modem freezes constantly and takes forever to reboot. My horrible internet is always disconnecting and saying that I have no Internet Service available and it's a complete waste to call Customer Service, because all that do is lie and give you the runaround. This is the second largest bill in my home which is ridiculous. I'm paying close to $300 a month for ** service that barely works...The info on ""My Account"" is inaccurate. I was told that I had 12 days to pay my bill before service would be interrupted, so I was surprised when I tried to access the Internet to start my work shift only to find out that I needed to contact Comcast, because my service was temporarily disconnected. This has happened twice and on today, I turned on my TV to see a message from Comcast that I needed to pay $29.30 to restore my service. Are you kidding me, when I just paid $280.00 on Friday, April 15th...? Is Comcast that hard up for money? I would say ""Absolutely"" which is absurd. Make sure you always check the 'Bill Details' because it's there when you'll find extra hidden fees.Why is there 9 different ""Taxes, Surcharges & Fees"" and there are 5 different ""Other Charges & Credits"" on top of a list of other things...? Comcast will double charge you and once you bring it to their attention, their answer is always ""You'll see a Credit on YOUR NEXT BILL."" I'm thinking, why the next bill, when the mistake/error was on this one? If they do give you a 'CREDIT' trust and believe, they have recompensated for this by overcharging you in another area. Don't believe me? Check your bill!!!I think we all need to come together and start a 'Class Action Lawsuit' against Comcast/Xfinity. I'm definitely about to talk to a Lawyer, because I'm so fed up with them. You could be calling about a problem you're having and the first and only thing they're thinking about is: ""Would you like to make a payment?"" If there was another Service Provider in my area, I could guarantee that Comcast would have no business and this is why they feel like they can and is taking advantage of their customers. There are thousands of people who I talk to who call in to vent about their unhappiness with Comcast. What a hike and disgrace!!!"
"Mendare of Hollywood, FL",42474,1,"I've been calling every day to dispute my bills for 1 month. I got charged for almost $500 for early termination fee. Thought it was a mistake. I called a Comcast rep the same day. She told that I was under an contract for 2 years, which I've never agreed for, and she told me that the fact that I cancelled it within a month she can remove the Early termination fee. She told me she removed it the same day. I checked a week later, it was still here. I called again and they told me they will call me back in 48 hours and they never did. Every time I called they keep on telling me the same thing for the whole month. I am so pissed for what they did because I've been a great customer for almost 10 years, always paid my bills on time. I am so ready to get rid of this horrible company."
"Robert of Richmond, CA",42470,1,Comcast is blocking NBA games airing on TBS and ESPN via Sling TV that are also aired on Comcast Sports Network. This is illegal.
"Kathi of West Valley, UT",42468,1,"Comcast jumps up your bill without you knowing then bills you for the over amount. You call their department - they promise it is taken care off after months on the phone. Every month tell you it is taken care of and never is, till you are so frustrated you want to cancel your subscription and they tell you that will cost you over a hundred dollars to cancel. They have you by the neck. No matter what horrible service always goes down have to reset the box constantly. I wish that I had never signed up for this product. I have never paid a late bill in my life but this was considered late payments even after I had talked with customer service and it was suppose to be fixed - instead added up months of late fees."
"Hayley of Hackettstown, NJ",42468,1,"After countless unpleasant, extensive and disappointing phone calls attempting to get to the root of my Blast Internet speed problems, being bounced from department to department, having my escalated calls cancelled and ""restarted"" multiple times, charging additional ""service"" fees, XFINITY rescinded the initial account credit offer citing that I, their ""Valued Customer"" ""called too many times"". I find it extremely disappointing and disheartening that this is what XFINITY calls customer service!"
"Steven of Knoxville, TN",42467,1,"First, allow me to start with an issue that transpired on day one of my move. Before I relocated from out of state to Tennessee, I contacted Comcast Customer Support. Everything was pretty smooth at that point. I was told to simply bring the equipment with me to the new home, schedule connection date and time, and be there with someone over the age of 18. Wow! That is easy enough. Unfortunately, they did not tell me that I should not pay my bill. Comcast bills a month in advance. So, when my bill was paid, the money was tied up in another section of the company that the region I moved to had no access to. Long story short, it was about 3 months before the money was returned, sent to correct address, or placed on current bill, and to top all that off, I was told I was getting disconnected for non-payment. When, in fact, I had over paid Comcast by nearly $300, and they owed me money!Now, let us move on to the final straw that made my decision indefinite to leave this company and absolute, beside horrid customer service! In Knoxville, Comcast puts a limit on the amount of Internet a household is allowed to use. Once you've reached that limit, they decide to charge you a recurrent fee of $10 for additional Gigabyte usage. Imagine getting a bill in the mail for 100's, even 1000's of dollars, over your normal monthly bill because you used the Internet too much for Comcast's likings. I am not one that downloads a lot of files either. I simply stream Netflix, Amazon, and use PS4 functions. Yes, the PS4 downloads some large files occasionally, but as a customer who already pays an arm and a leg for service, I expect to be able to use it without being charged more. My wife and children stay home during the day. So, with Netflix running for my toddler, that sucks up the data. We are now 3 months into our overage, and we are facing the outrageous charges of going over the allotted amount of Internet Comcast says we can use. Mind you, we already pay nearly $200 a month, but apparently nothing will satisfy the greed of this massive corporation. I hope Comcast enjoys missing my $200 a month, not including overage fees. I will be giving it to a new company servicing the Knoxville area, WoW! They have no limitations and are nearly half the price of Comcast in every aspect, including cable TV. Goodbye Comcast! Keep doing what you're doing, and you'll find that bad business ethics will only cost you more money as your customers keep leaving you."
"Felipe of Atlanta, GA",42467,1,"Minus 5 stars. I am so glad I cancelled my Comcast since I use antenna TV, no longer have a VoIP landline phone, use a smartphone and wifi spots. Comcast can no longer hold me hostage because I took control!! They sent the cable guy 3 different times just to get signal to my apartment. First cable guy made up the story that rats ate the cable, second cable guy that he couldn't reach the attic. They couldn't figure out a wiring problem. I had to lease one of their refurbished modems (aka JUNK unreliable used electronic device) which crashed on me 4 time in 6 months and had to return them. So I spent $170 on a new modem just to get Comcast! My bill jumped from $19.95 a month to $39.95 + $4.95 ""protection plan"" a month and a $9 late fee. So they terminated my service.When I paid $86 for the past due, I thought they would reconnect. But no - they issued a ""hard""(?) disconnect as opposed to a ""soft"" disconnect. Then they pleaded to keep me as a customer. Heck no!! So now they owe me a $9.57 refund. No wonder this is the worst-rated company out there! Good riddance of Comcast because I don't need them! I fought the battle with Comcast and won!!"
"marci of Delray Beach, FL",42467,1,"Upon turning on my computer, I had no internet service. This is a common problem with Comcast, so I paid no attention to it until later in the day when I still had no service. I called Comcast after going through their routine questioning, and was informed there was a problem in the area. I was told it would be fixed by 5 p.m. I requested that someone come to my home to check the problem out. They scheduled a person for the next day, (April 6) between 3-5PM. At 5.00 p.m. I received a text saying it was fixed. Of course, I still had no service. Around 8:00 p.m, I called Comcast again and spoke to someone in Columbia, who said he was a supervisor named Jason, who after the usual Comcast, ""I will help you"" and ""so sorry"" I again was told, about area problem. He in no uncertain terms told me he would call me back around 9.00 p.m. to see if the problem was solved. As I expected he did not call. The next morning I called again, and was speaking to someone in Mexico and I insisted on speaking to someone in the United States. After waiting 15 minutes, I was put through to someone in Michigan. I again explained the problem, and once again told it was an area outage. (I had asked all my neighbors if they were having a problem and they all said no.) ""So Sorry"", was the answer and they are working on the problem. I asked if my repair person was still scheduled to come and she told me no, they cancelled it because it was an high priory problem outside of my home. At this point I was furious. I called again and finally spoke to someone who spoke English and would get to the problem and reschedule the appointment for April 6. At 5.05p.m. On April 6, A Xfinity person arrives and tell me it was scheduled to go to my neighbor as his order said. My neighbor told him he was not having any problems but to go my house as I had the problem. When he came in he said he was not authorized to do anything since he had no order but he would call his manager and get permission which he did. After checking my connections in the house, he found nothing wrong. He went outside to check and went into the electrical room where the connections are and lo and behold someone had placed what they call ""a filter tap"" on my line with a yellow tag meaning a leak was discovered. The tag had no name, date or other explanation. That was the reason I had no internet. So the repairman removed it and lo and behold I had internet. I was informed that someone must have placed the tap on my wiring. He could not tell me why. Comcast could give me no answers. COMCAST LIED TO ME FOR TWO DAYS. Why are they allowed to be a business monopoly??? I have no choice in getting other service in my area."
"Lori of Saint Charles, IL",42467,1,We switched from regular Comcast TV to X1. They switched out our Modem at the same time and now I can not access my Emails for 2 days and guess what they do not have 24 hour customer service via Phone? Hmmm - are they even into the 20th century - let alone the 21st?
"Tyson of Atlanta, GA",42466,5,I recently moved and ordered new service at my new address. Comcast sent a service rep to install my Xfinity box. He arrived within the timeframe that I had set and was extremely helpful in getting me set up. He was even so kind as to put on boot covers as to not track dirt into my house. We got set up and running on his first try and he was out within an hour. I've been using it for a few weeks and have not had any issues. Connection speed has been good and have not had any glitches in service.
"brian of Savannah, GA",42458,1,"This is an example of how Comcast have left their installation at **, Savannah. Open to the weather and to any passing trouble maker. Total disgrace. Several attempts have been made for Comcast to fix this but no reaction. A poor statement of quality and will no doubt lead to service issues for the many customers. See pictures."
"S of Lacey, WA",42456,1,"I usually comment on how much I hate Comcast customer service but today it is their ethics. My husband tried a speed test through Comcast -- 80 bits or whatever when on the phone with them -- because our internet wasn't working. Through a non-Comcast site? 20. How can they live with themselves? Freaking liars. Our bill has gone up $20/year consistently over the last three years for the same service. It is just so wrong. However, they are the only high speed internet provider in the area. Monopoly, anyone?"
"Marcelle of Petaluma, CA",42456,1,I have been without a WIFI connection for more than one month now. If I want to use my iPad at night in my bedroom - I have no connection. My old modem that I rented from Comcast functioned perfectly well until Comcast switched to an updated modem in February (2016). I spoke to numerous Comcast employees and they came to my home without fixing anything. I think they lowered my Internet speed and did not tell me. I think Comcast is scamming customers. I have been with them for more than ten years now - always paid on time. (180 per month). I will contact the appropriate branch of government to help me and all others with complaints. I will be 81 in a couple weeks. I have been on the Internet since the early 90's. Have several websites and I need to work on a computer in any room of my home. This is unacceptable. My speed is worse than the 90s when I paid $15.00 a month. Please do something. Many other complaints online.
"Marniqua of Chattanooga, TN",42456,1,"I have had Comcast for 3 years and somehow I got signed into a 2 year agreement when I was told it would be 1 year. Ever since I have added internet and phone, this bill has been out of control. Not to mention that they bill you a month in advance for services you haven't used yet. I can't get any help on why there is an additional $142.00 on my bill monthly nor can I get help lowering it. Very unhappy."
"jeff of Meriden, CT",42453,1,"I have never had bad Internet and have been Cox, Metrocast, Frontier and never have had this many problems with the Internet. I use Skype a lot and always losing connection. With the others I could stay on Skype 24/7 and never had connection issues. Since Comcast I am lucky sometimes to have a connection for 10 minutes. It's the worst Internet I have ever had."
"Viedettanne of Coatesville, PA",42453,1,"C.S. called with an offer regarding triple play, sounded good so I went for it. Was not told correct amount so I cancelled & now I have to pay the bill that is 1/2 of my monthly check or have service terminated."
"Jeremy of Naples, FL",42452,1,"I signed up for xfinity Internet. They charged me for modem rental fees since day one when I clearly told them I don't need them as I have my own. I asked them ""did anyone come out here to set up my internet? Did you mail modems to me?"" They always say ""no I'm sorry, will change the billing and refund you"" and I always say ""thank you"" but I'll be calling next month as I Doubt this will be fixed. Same story 5 months in a row. After all of that waiting on hold and finally getting it fixed after 5 months I knew when I cancel my internet after the year I'll have more problems. I called them to not renew my internet after the year and told them I don't have any of their modems and not to charge me. They said ""oh don't worry you're all set, thank you for your business."" I got a letter next week stating I owe $77.00 for modems. Several phone calls later they said they would take care of it. It's now on my credit report. Bunch of bs. I don't know any other businesses that can get away with ** like these guys do. How can I get this off my credit report?"
"Alex of Mibile, AL",42450,1,"If you want a home Internet service, please do not pick Comcast for service. Why, they are a liar and cheat! I signed up home Internet from Comcast. They said there was $29.99 plus $10.00 for modem and its unlimited internet. Guess what, it cost me $134.99 month. Please be my advice, do not get hook Internet with Comcast, be smart ok."
"Brad of Hillsborough, NJ",42448,1,"I had a mark-out done for my dog fence. When the contractors were digging they hit my cable line and my internet was down. They immediately told me that they cut it so that is a cut line and no service is proceeded to call Comcast. First question was am I sure that my service is out. The customer service rep completely clueless said someone will come on Wednesday and said, ""I will call you back in a half hour."" Do you really think that happened? So I called back after a hour and a half, ""Someone maybe can come out on Monday."" Then I got a call from support to ask if my internet was working and I asked, ""Did someone fix the cut underground?"" and the rep didn't know what to say and just disconnected the call. That is some awesome service."
"Amy of Chattanooga, TN",42448,2,"Was anyone told that they would have unlimited Internet, but get an email saying ""you will be charged for over usage""?"
"Rodger of Irwin, PA",42448,1,"I was a Comcast customer years ago, and was very dissatisfied so I switched to Dish. A salesman sold me on giving them another try since I was not satisfied with my internet service. He told me that install would be easy and the install tech would do everything. I let the sales rep know that I had two phone lines in my home and they both had to be connected. When the installer came, he said he knew nothing about a second line, and he didn't know what to do since both lines had to connect it on the modem. I let him know that the sales rep told me that the installer would run a new line if he had to. He then said they don't do that, and He would not do that.After thinking about it for a few minutes, his solution was to drill a hole through both sides of an interior wall and run a feeder line from the second phone line to the modem. UNACCEPTABLE! I'm fairly handy, so I got to work and ran a new line myself and added a new phone jack in the room near the modem. While I was doing this he was getting more and more agitated because of the time it was taking. Bottom line it... I ended up spending my time and labor to get the install done. The sales rep completely misrepresented what would happen on the install. The sales rep was very nice when he hooked me in. He said to just call him if I had any issues. ""I'm always available"", he said. Three phone calls today, and no answer.It's just been a few hours, and all the memories of why I left them in the first place have come back. I'm ready to quit again. To top it off, 5 minutes after he left, the internet service stopped working. The only bright note of the day was that I called the toll free number and someone got it going remotely. STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST/XFINITY."
"Benjamin of Boynton Beach, FL",42446,1,"And so it begins... I just moved down here from New York and had to choose a provider. I wanted to go with DIRECTV but of course my building is facing the wrong direction. So between AT&T and Comcast. I read reviews on Comcast service and AT&T internet problems. Choosing between the two is like choosing between a Trump and Hillary election, you are going to be disappointed either way. I choose Comcast. After several visits to the place to get equipment and the runaround to get it set up, my internet struggled to get going. They stated the wires are dead in both outlets and would need to send a tech to look at it (which would cost money). Now how would an apartment complex that is continuously full all of a sudden have outlets that are ""dead""? I said no and that we would need to go ahead with it and they need to fix it on their end cause I'm not paying for a tech. (This was after I had to go there three times and wait over an hour each time.) Finally some ""magical way"" they got the internet to be fixed. Now the issues kept coming. On the third month I went to pay and saw that I was billed on the 10th of the month and then again the 27th of the month. How can I be billed for 4 months when I've only had it for 3 and on top of that I was charged a late fee. After several calls... Person 1 says it was a mistake, Person 2 says they do that now, and Person 3 says they're not cause they are only seeing 1 payment due but will remove the late fee. Oh how nice. Person 4 (the manager) says I'm only accountable for the 1 month but I now can see my upcoming bill, then how come I was charged a late fee? They don't know. Shocker!Now my cable issues are fun. Demand is terrible, breaks up all the time and freezes, as if I have a satellite from 1980 hanging off my porch. I had to restart my box several times. And then when I want to rent a movie they change my PIN every time. For the first 2 months no PIN then in the third month I needed a PIN. Called them, waited for 20 minutes to speak to someone. I asked them to remove the PIN. He said he can't so I make a PIN: **. 1 month later the PIN doesn't work. I call them, wait 20 minutes, again tell the guy the PIN doesn't work. He asks me if I would like the PIN removed? Say what now? This company is the most poorly run company I have ever witnessed. I count the days until I buy my house and can finally get DIRECTV. Stay Away!!!"
"Brandeeyes of Oakridge, TN",42444,1,"Triple play for 99 is an estimate only. After they add in all their hidden cost my bill is 184 a month. Also a data limit of 300gigs is ridiculous - that's a binge Netflix session. Always freezing up and the customer service is unreliable to say the least. Was told I'd be moved to unlimited data free of charge and 2 months later a charge of 55 was on my account raising my bill to 240 a month. I recorded all conversations and stored them just for this reason. I contacted customer service 3 times to be clear no extra charge for unlimited data would apply to my bill but did the fact I had 4 of their employees on record saying no charge would be applied, no it did not. Of course all this happened after my 30 days in which I could cancel and go with another company so I'm stuck for a year with an outrageous bill and the worst internet available. I suggest you really do your research and ask over and over what your bill will be after all the fees they continue to pack on after you sign. Not pleased and I will cancel asap."
"Leona L of Alexandria, VA",42442,1,"So, as I sit here having to use my Verizon MIFI because COMCAST XFINITY prematurely turned off my services!!! Rewind back a few days ago, 8 March 2016 to be exact, I alerted COMCAST XFINITY of my pending move for 25 March 2016. After about 10 mins of back & forth with the COMCAST XFINITY representative, she finally confirms (confirmation #**) my cancellation of services for 25 March 2016. Fast forward to last night, 12 March 2016, my COMCAST XFINITY services (phone, internet, and cable) are completely OUT. I called the representative and she was totally baffled, asking me if I tried to reset it, how long it's been out, if there is a power outage in the area, and that she has to check with her supervisor if she can submit a service request. Ask for permission? She stated she would call me within 15 mins, before 8:00 p.m., to let me know what time my appointment would be. I received a call at 7:59 p.m. stating that there wasn't a power outage in the area, it appears there's a problem on the outside, and that the soonest they'd be able to come is tomorrow afternoon (13 March 2016) between 1 and 4 pm. This morning, 13 March 2016, I received a call at 8:00 am from a COMCAST XFINITY representative asking if my issue had been resolved; I informed her it had not. She acknowledged my answer then reminded me that I had an appointment for TODAY, a technician would be here between 1 and 4 pm. As the clock approached 4 pm, 3:53 pm to be exact, I called COMCAST XFINITY to inquire about the technician. Well, they told me that they DON'T have anything scheduled for me, asked me if I paid my bill, and OH, ""your services were cancelled."" Not only was I insulted, but extremely infuriated! I paid my bill on 6 March 2016, I kept a copy of the chat that I had with the COMCAST XFINITY representative about my cancellation effective 25 March 2016. That is when the marathon runaround began. First, the representative told me that he has to transfer me to new accounts because they'd have to be the ones that turn on my services. By then, my husband took the phone to find out what has happened. Talk about the ABSOLUTE WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! FYI, the representative during the Chat was Divya, I cannot recall the representative's name from last night's call or the 8:00 am call; however, the representative we spoke with at 3:55 pm - 4:38 pm was ""Art"" who admitted he was physically in the Philippines, and now we have his supervisor ""Nick"". My husband is now asking for Nick's supervisor...which Nick CLAIMS he cannot disclose the name of his supervisor. Really? All I want is my friggin' services to be turned on!!! The same services that SHOULD NOT have even been turned off before 25 March 2016! My husband was transferred to the internet side of the house...CLOSED! WTH!!! I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER recommend this piss poor company! COMCAST XFINITY has false advertising AND their customer service is the ABSOLUTE WORSE!!!"
"Kaylan of Atlanta, GA",42440,1,"I called Feb 21 to get my devices set up. I was told I would have my internet, home security, and cable set up on February 25th. I recurve an email the night of the 21st saying my apt was set for March 14, 2016. That was not discussed over the phone. I call Comcast back and they told me that was the only time frame they had and it was scheduled. I immediately became upset because that was not the appointment I was promised. I was in my new apartment for a week and a day with no cable, no internet, no security. They installed ONLY THE CABLE AND INTERNET the following week. So in still looking for me why security to be installed.They waived the fee for the security, and I was told I would get 10$ off my bill for 12 months. Here it is March 10, 2016 and I still have no security system. I called back a few minutes ago and spoke to 5 different people within a matter of 20 minutes just for them to tell me that I don't even have an installation date in the system. They proceeded to offer me March 25th to get it installed. THAT IS A WHOLE MONTH with no service still. I am livid with Comcast. This is the worst cable company EVER. And I will not be giving them a dime until I get my services installed. Or better yet I may just drop them as a whole and go with another company. This is ridiculous!!!"
"Dylan of Westfield , IN",42438,1,After two weeks of having Comcast my services were canceled for no apparent reason. Was without service for two day. I talked to two representatives about why my services were canceled mind my bills were paid and everything. They could not figure out why they were canceled. Got them hooked up again only to be billed two weeks later for $220 for unreturned equipment. Although I still had my equipment because I still had service with them! They said they would refund me the equipment charge and a supervisor would call me within 24 to 48 hours.One week later no phone call and no refund. I call back and they gave the run around again saying they would have to give a ticket number to a supervisor to call me and give me a refund. Still have not heard anything. I have spent almost 3 hours total on the phone trying to figure out where my money is. Do yourself a favor and don't get involved in this mess of a company. I will be canceling as soon as I get my money back.
"Stephanie of Senoia, GA",42435,1,"After contemplating for 2 years to switch to Comcast I finally decided because AT&T Internet was driving me crazy. It was soooooo slow. We couldn't even watch Netflix on our tv or watch movies/shows on our Direct due to poor internet error all the time. And I work from home and it would drop connection all throughout the day. On March 3 Comcast came out, guy showed up and was working outside. After about an hour he tells me the tap on my street is dead. He was calling a technician to see if available to come out look at it, said I would need reschedule possibly. He told me that he should have checked tap on first before he started and he didn't. So I have this big box with cables everywhere hanging on side house. I was ok with that because I had not cancelled my Direct or AT&T yet. He leaves about 5, then my kids go to watch TV and it's not working. So, this idiot does not come back and you know he knew he had unhooked all Directv cords and rerouted to the new box. I call and of course I'm told they will expedite this, but no guarantee. Needless to say at this point my rescheduled date is March 15th, so these fools are leaving us without cable until then. After about 2 emails, 3 phone calls later on March 4, a guy shows up at my home, not the idiot that unhooked these cables, but new guy and plugs all cables back in. But after 1 hour on phone with Direct, still NO cable. So I had to schedule Direct to come out on March 11 to reconnect and get me back up and running and hope they don't charge me a fee to so. This guy John did at least give me his # to call and come back out on Saturday if box does not start working. So I call him back and he said he will try find a guy to come out, but UNSUCCESSFUL. They were ""loaded"" he said for day and would thought maybe heard back from him, but ""crickets"". Now, I did not want to rate COMCAST/INFINITY because I feel they don't deserve my rating because they've showed me the service that I will be getting with them, but I had to choose a 1 star. But COMCAST don't get cocky, because really you are a big fat ZERO star in my eye right now. So now to decide to continue to make my switch or not. Very, very dissatisfied customer."
"George of Mechanicsburg, PA",42434,1,"Be prepared for a complicated, detailed and possibly faulty sign-up process. We encountered a rude agent, then failure to get phone number and equipment delivery. Had to go through ""reprocessing."" Hoping try no. 2 works."
"Rick of Miami, FL",42432,1,"My Internet has been and still is down since 2/17/16. Every day I call to check and I get the same message, ""Your internet is suffering a problem and it should be ready by"" and then depending on the time of day you will get a 2:30 pm, 7:10 pm or a 10:20 pm. Obviously none occur. On top of all that luckily I finally was able to get a hold of an agent who told me to call the billing department and ask for a credit, If I hadn't I wouldn't have received anything and even now I was credited till the first time I was able to speak to an agent which was 2/29/16. Since we are still with the same problem we have to call every day, go through the trials of automated answering to try to reach an agent (this is very time consuming) to get a credit."
"Sandra of Cambridge, MD",42431,1,Had no phone or internet service for 4 days. Comcast gave me 4 appointments. Either no tech showed and I was told 2 of my appointment was scheduled unsuccessfully. Comcast reps scheduled the appt therefore it's their fault if the appt was scheduled unsuccessfully. I missed 3 days of work because they had me waiting on a tech each day from 9-4. One day from 8-4. When my service is finally restored I called Comcast to get credited for those days I didn't have service. They only credited me 50.00. I was told earlier in the week it would be 20 for each missed appt.Comcast is full of **!!! I missed out on hundreds of dollars in wages and they wouldn't even credit me what they said they were because their reps didn't put all the appts in the system. I asked them aren't the calls recorded just to verify the appts their reps gave me? They said yes but they didn't have access to the recordings. Wow!!!
"Rene of Clarkston, MI",42430,1,"After I sold my house, I paid all final charges from Comcast. A few weeks later a sleazy salesperson called and convinced me that I should only put my account on hold until I moved into my new house which was then under construction. Trusting him, I agreed, and paid a few months charges of $14/mo for nothing at all, and then started getting invoices for over $200 per month. Starting in 8/15, I have had at least 8 phone sessions (very lengthy) and 6 office visits to get resolved their billing me for no service whatsoever. When I moved into my new house in Sept, it took me until Dec to get them to start new service and now they say I owe them for a 'bad debt' of over $100.00. I was courteous today, but agent could not find the source of the charges and ended up just cutting me off. Beware of sales calls from Comcast."
"Vincent of Coconut Creek, FL",42430,1,"I tried to upgrade my internet service but found out that I was only allowed to get the higher speed internet that Comcast offers if I upgrade and bundle services that I didn't want or need. Since I am of the generation labeled a ""cord cutter"" it seems that I am being limited on what speed of internet I can get by how much money I am willing to spend with the company. I don't need the Comcast TV service, but it seems that if I don't purchase it, I am only allowed data speeds up to 50 mbs. If I get tv, then and only then am I allowed to get the higher speeds of internet that are available in my area. According to the customer service rep, those higher speeds get ""grayed out"" in the system if I don't get a bundle package. This is a discriminatory move that should not be allowed. If the higher speed is not available then that is one thing, but I should not be FORCED to spend money on a product that I don't want nor need in order to get one that I do. The account is under Ashley ** my fiance. Any help getting this resolved would be greatly appreciated."
"Karl of Katy, TX","Feb. 27, 2016",1,"I briefly rented a modem from Comcast years ago before buying my own and returning it to the store. Luckily I was smart enough to keep the receipt. Every few months for the past several years they've added the equipment rental fees back to my account and every time I've asked them to stop they've threatened to bill me for the full replacement cost of all the equipment I've returned; hundreds and hundreds of dollars. Each time I've read them back the # on the receipt and they've relented, but each time I've spent hours on hold."
"M. P. of Roswell, GA","Feb. 25, 2016",1,"Worked with Comcast for 4 months, and they run the most unorganized and unethical business practice. Paid to have phone line transferred, didn't happen even after 4 months! Internet service is ""16mbs"" down and 3mbps upload, which isn't even CLOSE to what we were getting in real world results. Our results? 7mbps down and 1.1 up when everyone is not using the bandwidth. You know what the tech rep said to us? ""You can always pay more for more speed."" WE DON'T EVEN GET THE SPEED YOU SOLD US.How in this day and age can we get Google Fiber (1 TERABYTE) download speed for $70, which is what we pay Comcast right now for internet service alone, and consider Comcast as a business who offer us ""value"". Short answer. They don't. Don't deal with them, don't deal with their customer ""service"", and most of all, don't waste your valuable time. The only other reliable internet service we've had is Charter, and we've been in business with them for 16+ years. The fact that I am going out of my way to make an account and write a review should explain how poor our experience was with Comcast Internet."
"Joshua of Philadelphia, PA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"My modem is directly connected to my computer. I've had speed issues amounting to almost 5 visits from technicians. The customer service is impossible to talk to, and most of them aren't even from the states. I would switch from them to Verizon in a second if Verizon was available in my building. If you have a choice, do not choose Comcast. 93 dollars a month for speeds at 2.26 - 5.75 on the blast plan. The whole company is as crooked as government sanctioned organized crime."
"Carmen of Mount Holly, NJ","Feb. 23, 2016",1,"I have contacted Comcast so many times I've lost count. By far one of the worst cable companies I've ever had service with and I wish there was another cable company that was available in the area, I would switch immediately. My WIFI is so slow I can't stream anything. Ridiculous how the modem is inches away and won't even allow me to connect to Netflix, or my tablet. Of course you contact customer service and it's so frustrating speaking to some of the reps. They have upgraded my WIFI so they say so it can be faster and better and I see no change. I finally got my own router and am willing to try that just so I don't have to deal with this company and calling in anymore because obviously they do not care about their customers. By far the worst ever... Shame on you."
"msthyl@msn.com of Greensboro, NC","Feb. 21, 2016",1,"Poor service - Internet, phone and cable. Every month my service goes out and it takes hrs on the phone to get it back up and most of the time it takes them days to get someone to come out and get the service up and going again."
"Alex of Woodridge, IL","Feb. 19, 2016",1,"FALSE information given by agents... and terrible notetaking from these agents. Spoke with Jennifer for credit of billing and was not crediting my billing for the time period where my services were disrupted. She transferred me to a supervisor, Eve. Supervisor Eve did what she was trained to do and did not allow any credit, rather repeated herself as if it was a script. My television services and telephone services and internet services did not function as they should. Technician came out and resolved the issue after TWO+ months of service disruptions. ALL Xfinity services did not function as they should, ALL not working. At the time of the initial call and during the follow-up calls I was reassured that proper credit would be applied. Terrible way to do business as a big company."
"Joy of Saint Charles, IL","Feb. 18, 2016",1,"Never got a fully installed service. Tried to contact for business service as I work from home. Made no less than 10 calls to sales and others at Comcast. Kept getting told they were calling back and emailing us and never did. Then they finally scheduled install upon threat of our canceling the service, but never showed up. A quick, no communication inspection apparently put install on hold and Comcast didn't feel that warranted a call. I called finally and found out. If this is representative of customer service, no thank you. Canceled the install, and won't be using them. Doesn't matter what download speeds they say they guarantee, if you can't get any service. I guess the competitors will have an easy time satisfying me, even if they can't guarantee the speed."
"allison of Jacksonville, FL","Feb. 18, 2016",1,"By far, the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I have sent multiple emails to corporate with no response. I have had issues ongoing for over 2 years without resolve and Comcast has still not effectively credited my account. FURIOUS CUSTOMER here. I have been told for the last 2 years a credit would be applied backdated to the date the issues started, to the date of resolution and have received $60 worth of credit. For 2 years of bad service, I have lost a job and countless hours at my other job because of these issues and Comcast has yet to resolve the issues. I am beyond frustrated at this point as I have made countless phone calls and sent numerous emails. Clearly, nobody gives a **. I want this properly rectified and I want it done NOW. You can message me. I will post this on every social media forum I can find."
"John of Knoxville, TN","Feb. 17, 2016",1,"I called Xfinity to troubleshoot my internet at 4 am 2/17/2016, got connected to someone who I swear came to this country on a floating door as I had to tell him twice I was outside and not near the router, had to tell him three times I was NOT going to set an appointment for a service technician as I wasn't going to pay $25 for that.He tried resetting my router which did not work, and I eventually hung up on him, went on my phone to xfinity chat and was told again that there was no server maintenance (I don't believe that) but was told my router/modem through xfinity had device problems, got ready to set up an appointment for 2/17/2016 and as soon as was in the process of setting up the appointment my internet magically started working. It seems to me that the customer service technicians either don't know when/if there is server maintenance or that xfinity is such a money hungry company that they shut off internet just to get you to schedule a service technician to come out so they can rape you of more money."
"Randy of Sacramento, CA","Feb. 15, 2016",1,The Wifi is going back to dial up - call customer service - not only do they have no idea on the service but barely speak English - definitely call center is NOT in the United States. Frontier was 150 percent better. They sell you a faster wifi service but the signal is NOT there. I want to cancel but now I'm locked in by contract!
"Martin Buzzy of Timonium, MD","Feb. 14, 2016",1,Just got my bill on Saturday and it went up another 22.00 after a 14.00 hike 4 months ago and they took more channels away. I will not sit on phone and discuss this with them again. Once a year for past 5 years my bill has gone from 76.00 with equipment and taxes in 2010 to 152.00 this month and I've lost at least a dozen channels since that time and this is for TV and internet which is the worst internet out there and the worst customer service ever. No surprises I've already contacted Fios for TV internet all equipment taxes and free setup for a 3 year lock at 105.50 a month. Thank God. Goodbye Comcast. Can't wait for a new service provider to come in and put Comcast in their graves.
"kevin of Clarkston, MI","Feb. 13, 2016",1,Horrible Internet speed\service from Comcast! Comcast blast speeds are a small fraction of what they promise. I have a ethernet connection to the TV and can't even watch Netflix or Amazon streaming because the internet speed is so slow!!
"Cynthia of Canton, GA","Feb. 12, 2016",1,"For over a year, I have repeatedly contacted Comcast/Xfinity about problems with their modem. I would lose telephone connectivity for hours. Movies streamed via Netflix or Amazon on Demand would freeze and stop playing. Finally, I completely lost my internet connection when the Wi-Fi function on their modem stopped working. A technician was sent out to my home, and he confirmed that the modem was broken, and he installed a new one. I then had to back Comcast/Xfinity down for attempting to charge me $50 for a new installation. I decided to check out getting a new service provider. Ten years ago, my phone and internet service provider was AT&T. They no longer provide service to my area. Comcast/Xfinity monopolizes my area. I cannot use anyone but them for internet and/or cable tv. I can, however, switch to another phone provider (at least for now).When customers only have one choice for internet and cable tv, service and reliability goes down the drain. Comcast/Xfinity does not care whether or not their equipment works. Comcast/Xfinity does not care whether or not customers receive the service they have paid for -- and look at your bill, you pay for service before you have even received it. Comcast/Xfinity does care about imposing price increases to satisfy their fat, lazy, rich investors. A customer use to get the first two cable boxes at no charge. Now, you only receive one cable box with your package. Comcast/Xfinity does not care that their customer service personnel are rude and ignorant. Why? We the consumers have nowhere one else to go!A monopoly can set prices at whatever it wants (called ""price fixing""). A monopoly creates inflation since they can set any price they want to. A monopoly can sell inferior products (e.g., their modem). A monopoly has no incentive whatsoever to provide better service and products because there is no competition. This is a very sad situation. Due to systematic deregulation by our ineffective US Congress, Comcast/Xfinity has been allowed to dominate and control the telecommunications market. What happened to healthy business competition? I have decided when my contract with Comcast/Xfinity ends in March 2017, I will no longer have internet or cable tv in my home. I would rather go without these services. I refuse to give any more of my hard earned money to Comcast/Xfinity."
"John of Camas, WA","Feb. 10, 2016",1,"On Feb 2nd, Comcast technicians came to install our triple play system at 10:45 am. When they left at 3:40, they had the two set top boxes in the wrong rooms (Voice-activated box was in the bedroom, and the non-voice activated box was in the family room). Internet did not work at all. It is now Feb 10, and I fixed the internet settings myself four days ago on the ethernet connected computer, and did the settings on the wireless computers two days ago. They all now work fine, no thanks to the technicians. When the technicians were here, they could not get the family room set top box to work with our Pioneer surround sound, so they just used HDMI cable and ran directly to the tv (No surround sound). Today, I switched the two set top boxes back to the proper rooms and had the surround sound working within 5 minutes. I think Comcast could save a lot of money by firing all their technicians and letting the homeowners set up our own systems. I was in touch with the salesman last Friday explaining all the issues I was having, and he said he would get his supervisor and come see me on Monday. Yup, you guessed it, this is Wednesday and I have not heard a peep. Comcast just plain does not care about their clients. Be forewarned if you are considering their services, you will have many heartaches in your dealings with them."
"Pam of Pembroke Pines, FL","Feb. 10, 2016",1,I called last month to take advantage of offer for exact same services I already have for $59.95. It's in writing on January statement. I was told I cannot have the offer. No understandable explanation given. No services added or removed or changed in any way. February bill comes and it is higher than before.
"Kaye of Pittsburgh, PA","Feb. 8, 2016",1,"I purchased Blast+ internet that offers 150 mbps download speeds first at a reduced price then at the regular price for 2+ years (with breaks). From the beginning the quality of the services varied from bad to worse. At first I complained in passing, but only when the service just wouldn't work. As my technical knowledge improved I realized on a good day I was receiving speeds of approximately 35 mbps and bad days 11mbps. I complained several times until finally I was told the modem/router provided by Xfinity was not capable of offering the service I was paying for and I was refunded $26. This is particularly frustrating since I am expected to pay for the service I requested, but it seems that Comcast is not required to provided the service they agreed to provided and the onus of understanding and finding the problem lies the customer."
"Jorge of North Port, FL","Feb. 6, 2016",1,"Comcast has by far the worst customer service I have ever encountered. We have had cable issues now for 2 days with no resolution. When I try to call them I am placed on hold for up to 15 minutes at a time or flat out disconnected. They are the most unreliable company I have EVER dealt with and I am cancelling any and all services offered by this sham of a company. Constant issues with reception, ridiculously poor customer service, and runaround. This is what you can expect from this company. I am sorry I ever signed up with their services and paid these people our hard-earned money. There has not been a single month I have not called them for a problem. They are horrible and everyone should stay away from them."
"Barbara of Buckner, MO","Feb. 4, 2016",1,"This is the 2nd time Comcast/XFINITY has STOLEN money off my credit card. They took 2 payments a week apart. And try to give me attitude when I demand it back, then had the nerve to tell me it would take 3weeks to put it back on my card! Worst Company Ever! Moving to another!"
"Will of Sarasota, FL","Feb. 4, 2016",1,"In the last couple of months I have more and more trouble with Comcast or is it Xfinity to keep my Internet connection. My Internet connection is disconnected at least 10 times per day and it getting worse. When I call Comcast or is it Xfinity? It's just always the same. We can do some troubleshooting... That's it. I paid already for a technician even I had this insurance but they told me I did something wrong so the insurance wasn't valid and I paid approximately $75 extra.The Internet page of Comcast... After 1 click it become Xfinity... Is extremely user unfriendly and extremely slow. Sometimes when I clicked on a button I don't know what happens until I see everything (the software/Internet page) is working and waiting... The Internet page of Comcast is just a bunch of... I don't know, because I have to click a dozen time and I need a lot of look to find something useful. Next time I try the same way I am always lost and always on other pages. For me it looks like Comcast WANT that the customer get lost. The Internet presence is just trash, sorry but it is.Calling Comcast (or is it Xfinity) is extremely annoying because first a machine ask you a lot questions and you have to enter a lot of numbers. One minute later you will talk with another machine but this machine ask you the same questions again and you have to enter the same number again. Today I was talking 5 (five) minutes until I came to the waiting loop and I waited 5 more minutes. If I could I would change immediately the Internet provider but Comcast has a monopoly in my area."
"Larry of Dunkirk, MD","Feb. 4, 2016",2,"I don't like the new home page, I hate it. Too many large picture, need more easy to use menu features, no calendar like the old one where you can schedule appointments, the old home page was much better. The home page menu needs so have smaller icon/click on(s) with smaller pictures, needs to have the stock market information and new breaking news."
"Stacey of Beachwood, NJ","Feb. 3, 2016",1,"I have two options in my area for internet, Comcast cable or Verizon DSL, so naturally my only option is Comcast due to speed. I have chosen to live without tv and feel punished for that choice. Comcast bullies you into bundles or else you pay a ridiculous amount for internet only. When my $70 a month internet subscription stopped working effectively I called customer service. I have never experienced anything like their customer service in my life! After an hour on the phone I had a pounding headache, my blood pressure was through the roof, I was still spending $70 a month for internet that no longer worked, and I was told that I needed to buy new equipment (modem & router) even though what I had was new and was their recommendation. I have never experienced a company like this and unfortunately am at their mercy. It seems unfair. Looking into other choices even if it means switching to slower internet."
"John of Knoxville, TN","Feb. 3, 2016",1,"I've had service at my current location for 3 years. I have generally been happy with the actual service but have continued to have issues with my billing. In three years my bill has went up over %25 and has happened $2-3 at a time although I have pretty much the same services/channels when I signed up initially. Last month my bill went up over $60 with no explanation. I called customer server and was told I had promotional price that expired. After talking with the retention department for over an hour, I agreed to accept a different bundle that included a phone so my price wouldn't go up. I didn't need or want the phone but agreed to avoid another $60/month. It didn't make sense but I refused to pay more or be locked into a contract.To be proactive I went ahead and paid my normal billing amount so my account would be current. I got my next month's bill and it had a credit over almost $200.00 which made no sense to me. I called and was told that it was because of the service change and it would be adjusted next month. Two days later my internet service quit working. I called and was told it was a technical issue but I was skeptical. After spending most of the morning on the phone, they told that the order for the ""upgrade"" I got last month didn't go through because my modem was not compatible with the phone service and that they disconnected my Internet service by mistake.Comcast has a practice of gouging customers by ""promotions"". The real goal is to increase the RPC or Revenue per customer which is a key performance metric and watched closely by Wall Street. Instead of providing real value they use trickery to continue to raise customer bills by small amounts over a period of time. They have a whole bunch of tricks including disconnecting channels and telling you that you were accidentally getting them for free and other nonsense requires you to spend time calling in to their customer service reps and when you hang up your bill has gone up a few dollars.If you don't mind spending time on the phone fighting to keep your cost contained and dealing with the most rude and pushy customer service reps I've ever talked to, Comcast provides a fine service. Ironically my service is fast and I've been happy with it but now I will never use them. I am an IT consultant and I never recommend them to anyone especially for business use. I am lucky enough to have competition on my street so I am going to give WOW a try. They can't be any worse. I'll leave a review for them once I am up and going and have had a chance to interact with their customer service."
"Bella of Plantation , FL","Feb. 2, 2016",1,"Don't fall for the commercials saying ""Xfinity is faster than AT&T."" It's all a lie. I have AT&T at a different house and I have no problems whatsoever, and I'm in a complete AT&T dead zone. I can't even watch a video on YouTube straight through without having it 1) buffer many times and 2) be terrible blurry quality with Xfinity. I'm supposed to have speeds at 25 MBPS but when I did a speed test, I was getting 76 KBPS. I can't watch movies On Demand either. If you have Xfinity, I would switch to AT&T immediately because you are getting ripped off majorly. If anyone is considering switching to Xfinity, DON'T!"
"Victor of Roswell, GA","Jan. 31, 2016",2,"For roughly the past 4 months, my internet service has been unreliable. To be clear, it works 95% of the time but it is unreliable. It will drop. The impact is upon my ability to effectively function at times. Everything that I do both personally and professionally is dependent upon having a high quality, reliable internet connection. By all accounts, that is supposed to be cable. I have checked with others in my neighborhood. Most seem to be using AT&T Uverse and having no issues. One other neighbor reports having Comcast and also experiencing issues. When it drops, not only am I unable to work on the internet, it is a distraction and often requires effort to recover from the outages. It seems apparent that Comcast is having infrastructure issues and perhaps not pursuing this with what AT&T would call a focus on ""dial tone reliability"". I went to the Comcast office last weekend (7-8 days ago) and swapped out the modem/router. I learned that I had not had the best modem/router for the service that I am buying. All the same, I have had outages since I changed the modem/router. I need Comcast to improve this service."
"Allison of Colorado Springs, CO","Jan. 31, 2016",1,"In November our promotion ended. I called Xfinity to see what other promotions were currently available and was talked into trying a bundled package with the assurance that if I was not happy, I could cancel the tv service and go back to just Internet for 39.99 a month for 25mbps. I called and attempted to cancel tv service and go back to just Internet for the price quoted as mentioned above. The representative told me I could not do that and 25mbps would cost us 69.99 a month and it was cheaper just to keep tv. She would not let me talk to a supervisor as I requested multiple times so I ended the call and called back a week and a half later when I was having internet issues. I spoke to a customer service rep who removed the tv service and upgraded us to 75mbps for the same price of 49.99 a month. I was ecstatic. She stated I would have to agree to a year commitment, I stated that was fine. I agreed to the terms of 75mbps for 49.99 a month for a year. I looked at our bill today and we are only receiving 25mbps for 39.99 a month and charged 10.00 a month for a speed upgrade?!? I don't even know how this is legal as these are not the terms I agreed to and we are being charged 10 dollars a month for services we aren't receiving. Comcast Xfinity is the worst company to deal with and totally scams its customers."
"Shireen of Boston, MA","Jan. 27, 2016",1,I signed up for a one day pass with XFINITY when I was back in Boston. The password wasn't working even after resetting it so I called the number on the email. The customer service person forwarded me to the technical support person who then forwarded me to the Wi-Fi department who then forwarded me to someone that suggested that I call the number that I first called!!! After complaining that I was being sent in circles one guy tried to help by calling the initial number. Never got this resolved. I DO NOT suggest using their one day service. Find another carrier.
"K. of Houston, TX","Jan. 26, 2016",1,"They say that they have the fastest internet, it's lie. I pick the fastest package they have because I have multiple gadgets that are connected to the internet at the same time. Guess what, some of my items are never able to connect on the internet. One time I was on the phone with their customer service rep. more than 5 hours, but they were not able to solve the issue. I have a smart TV which was only able to be connected on the internet once... useless. I will never ever get them again, and I am going to tell everyone I know not to get them. False advertisement."
"Cindy of Salt Lake, UT","Jan. 24, 2016",1,"My name is Ken. I been with you guy, long enough to say loyalty. But certainly you take away Spike Channel without courtesy notice.

"Charlie of Naples, FL","Jan. 23, 2016",1,"This is third outage of e-mail (I can receive but can't send) on Comcast site I have had in 3 months. Seems like they don't keep any record of what went before as always have to start with the lowest person on the ladder and struggle through hours of abortive attempts on their part before they will move me to the next tier. They start it over again, from the top, go through all the overly-courteous BS before sending me up the ladder. I have now learned to insist the interceptor push me ahead immediately so I don't have to spend time with the greenhorns, who don't seem to have English as their first language. Just frustration in trying to communicate with a communications company. They have a kindergarten approach to customer problems."
"James of Noblesville, IN","Jan. 22, 2016",1,"The wife works from home, and uses the internet to connect to her company. Recently she was unable to connect. She called Comcast to schedule service. The technician showed up three days after call. In the interim my wife cannot access the internet, so 3 days no pay. The technician troubleshoots, determines that it's a bad cable in the family room... other end of house on lower level. He replaces the cable, charges $75 for the installation. He leaves and is still in the driveway and our internet goes down. She immediately attempts to get him back, but he has to go to next appointment. Now we don't have TV reception in bedroom, internet is still down and we paid $75 for a cable that didn't need replacing. We're now told it'll be 3 more days for another technician to come out... Meanwhile my wife can't work and will have lost a week's pay."
"Jonathan of Boston, MA","Jan. 22, 2016",1,"If you're ever planning on getting Comcast internet provider, don't. Because they will cheat you on the pricing for packages that are expensively horrible. They make false advertisements of claiming to be the fastest internet provider. They're not. Imagine paying $60 a month for average internet to work on things, but it seems like your internet fluctuate like crazy and it is as slow as a 1 GB phone internet service. And going to customer support? Calling doesn't work because you'll call them and they'll tell you the same darn thing every time as a solution for your internet -- ""Restart your modem."" No, it doesn't work. And then you try to negotiate with them on other possibilities to fix this issue, yet all they do is curve you into other directions trying to show you more packages and making you pay even more for even more horrible services. Like are you going to help me or not? Or are you just going to curve me and distract me and cheat me and make me pay more than what I request? Comcast takes a step even further in creating XFINITY WiFi from your modem without your consent. At the start of set-up, they create the internet leaving it open. By doing that people can use your internet without paying a single bill, while you're here paying heavy loads. And honestly if you're new to tech well let me just explain to you just how false marketing this company and just how bullshit this company is. First off your modem, or your internet box. The insides are made in the 90s. They're not modern stuff. They just put the 90s insides in a new plastic case and say they're state of the art modems. They do this so they pay less on providing these internet boxes and it doesn't even work well either way, and the fact that they make you pay for renting their modem too, is just full of bull crap. Like calling them wouldn't help. They even go as far in disrespect as hanging up the call on you midway without even answering your questions. This company can't provide internet for life, yet they still falsely advertise about it. I suggest looking for a different internet service other than Comcast. Its better to save lots of money and have a good internet standing, than paying a whole lot and getting internet slow as a sloth."
"theresa of Beech Grove, IN","Jan. 21, 2016",1,"I had a contract for 24 months, I called to see if I could lower the bill. They lowered by on 7 dollars. I had to call them about my security system and they informed me while we were talking that they had put me in a new contract for another 24 months when I lowered my bill. They never said anything about that! So I went above their heads and talked to Avery - he said he would get me out of the contract and give me it all for 161.00 a month for 12 months. Then I would have to call cause the bill would go up. I just found out HE PUT ME IN ANOTHER ONE FOR ANOTHER 24 MONTHS! WTF!!! Comcast is nothing but money grabbing liars."
"Ade of Pembroke Pines, FL","Jan. 21, 2016",1,"Got to work on January 20th. Found out we had no phone or Internet service. Called Comcast, they said they are working on it and would be restored before 3pm. Which by the nature of our business is too far a stretch. Called them again at 3pm, they said they would be sending a technician out within an hour. I called them an hour later, they said the earliest time they have available is the following day the 21st, not in the morning, not in the afternoon but between 4 and 9pm. In essence they are telling us to come in and sit down for another whole day not able to fill prescriptions, customers cannot pick up their medicines because there is no register to ring them up or counsel them, we can not receive prescriptions from doctors offices because no fax, no Internet for electronic prescriptions, no phone was working. Tried to make them realize the damage they're causing to my business but that would not even move them to get us a technician. If there is a star below 1 star that is what I would have given. Comcast does not care if they put us out of business, send all our customers to competitors but they are quick to send you monthly bills. I am really disgusted with this company and their lack of concerns for people's plight. I do not know how many customers we have lost to competitors in a span of 48 hours. What is the lifetime value of those customers? Only time would tell. We will start exploring our options too."
"Jess of Indiana, PA","Jan. 18, 2016",1,"I called Comcast to set up Wi-Fi for an apartment I recently moved into. An appointment was setup for someone to come install it. We talked about when I would get my first bill and even got a confirmation number. When I moved in, no one showed up so I called Comcast. They did not even have my name in their system at all. The man told me that the previous tenant still had an active account at the location so I wasn't able to make an account. So then, I talked to my landlord and we talk to Comcast together. Comcast said that they would call the previous tenant and NOT make me drive an hour to a service center. Another appointment was set up for someone to install it. Now, I just got a call saying I actually do have to go to a service center or no one will come to install the internet. I wish I could rate lower than one star. This service is absolutely terrible. I will absolutely move somewhere that provides a different internet company."

So I played MC by myself and several lag makes me lose 6 games in a row and then my internet goes out. 10 mins later it come back on and called them once more and I called them at 3:24 PM and talked to a guy and he put me on hold until 5:00 and I hanged up and 12 mins later my friend skypes me and it took me 4 mins until he heard my voice. Me back on GTA 5 can't and it took 4 mins to find a lobby and even then I LAG out and my friend is having fun and I'm sitting waiting. When I join his game I get a time TO NOT WAIT but after 27 mins later my internet goes out - no storm, no wind, nothing. I want to change my internet but I can't so I'm so mad that I asked my friend for HIS INTERNET. It's not Xfinity.

"Fernand of Miami, FL","Jan. 16, 2016",1,"I so hate this company. I only hope for AT&T get to my area to leave it for good. I am even considering to move out to an area with AT&T U-verse high speed internet. I used to have unlimited internet - now Comcast have limited to 300 gb and have trained their representative to lie about it saying that internet plans were always up to 300. I know is a lie because I've always used way more than that. I have subscription to Amazon Prime videos, Hulu and Netflix. I don't use their cable service because is awful. I can get almost as many channel with an antenna on my roof for free and in HD. Your basic cable plan should be called ""blurred vision time or pay extra for the same."" I only have a bundle package because they made me in order to pay less for the internet service (I didn't even unpacked the cable box) they are limiting the only thing I need from them which is the only good thing they have, and now they are messing up that too. The government should investigate this company for monopolizing the market and steal from their clients. The 300 gb limit is just another way to steal and rise the prices to make more profits. In my zip code is only Comcast so I think I'll have to move. By the way, their representatives suck. When they are caught in a lie they just keep saying it as if that were gonna make it true."
"Jared of Salt Lake City, UT","Jan. 16, 2016",1,"While moving to a new location I called them to have my internet switched over to the new apartment. A Xfinity Community. Should have all the hook ups already. They said on the phone they couldn't find the address and they would have to put in some sort of request to get the address and they would call back the next day. Two days go by and I am now in the apartment. Luckily it has hold over internet that isn't that great. Basically no videos. I call them again. Another representative says the same thing. Wait two days, no call back. Call a third time, this lady is helpful and says the request was never submitted. Perfect. A week had gone by and nothing. I was told I had to wait until January 15th. Three weeks after my initial contact. Today is the 15th. They said they would finish and confirm between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. It is now 9 p.m. and no confirmation and still crappy internet. They haven't said anything about delays. They are just a horrible company that doesn't take care of their customers."
"darek of Addison, IL","Jan. 15, 2016",1,"I cancelled the service in the last week of December and I returned the Comcast box few days later. I paid all my bill. In January I received a bill with new charges for January and when I called Comcast I was informed that the service was not cancelled. After 30 minutes on the phone I was told that my service was cancelled and I don't need to pay for January. A week later I found out that the service was not closed and I spend over 1 hour on the phone being transferred to 5 different Comcast reps, I guess in India, they don't speak well English. I was assured that the service will be closed in 2 working days. He could not close the service because this is an internal Comcast thing."
"Akhil of Milton, DE","Jan. 14, 2016",1,Worst company ever I have dealt with which don't care about customer satisfaction. I have had internet service with them since 2 years and have instructed them I won't like to have any other service with them but they still push the bundle in my account without my permission and then charge extra for me. When I try to return extra device at local office then they don't take it and give promise my rates will stay the same but guess what? Rates went up by $11. Then I complained and instead of trying to adjust they justified the new rates. Once their technician comes out to service 15 minutes late then arrival time and by that time I have resolved the problem and already left for work. So the technician tell my wife that we won't get charged for it since he didn't had to do anything ant they still charged for $20. When I call them to reverse the charge again phone lady tries to justify the charges. I am so fed up with their service that I want to give up on them but I don't have any alternative in my area. I wish this Internet never have been discovered if such are the service provider I had to deal with. Totally rubbish ISP to have as Comcast.
"Fari of Portland, OR","Jan. 14, 2016",1,"I have been with Comcast for years and rarely ever had a good experience with them when I called in for help. At least twice they charged me for services I did not ask for, and when I asked them to remove the fee they said that they would but never did. This time was worst! A month ago they raised my fee by $5 and when I called in and threaten that I would go with CenturyLink, they told me that they would give twice as my current speed plus basic channels for the same price for one year.A month later I got a bill from them for $30 more. When I called in they told me that they had no record of my previous conversation and that deal did not exist. On top of that, the person on the phone was extremely rude and abrasive. Then they asked me to return the box which I did not want in the first place for that price. Now I have to go out of my way to a UPS office to send that damn thing back. I'm switching to CenturyLink."
"Julian of West Palm Beach, FL","Jan. 14, 2016",1,It starts with waiting on the phone for often 20 mins for a person to answer.. Then when someone does answer they transfer you and probably intentionally disconnect you. After 11 calls in 2 days I get an appointment only to wait all day for a NO show. Try calling someone... It goes on and each time it's a new person with little manners and even less education.. After a month it's finally installed but then my bill is $100 more than the quotation. Try calling again... It goes on getting worse and worse until the average person gives up. I gave up... Comcast you are the worst company...
"Nilson of Miami, FL","Jan. 13, 2016",1,"I called Comcast reference my poor Internet speed. I have already relocated my Comcast router 2 times and paying for both times, and both times having bad service. The cable work on the outside of my house looks like a 2 year old put it up. Then I called. I speak to an agent and he tried as he could but he could not help my horrible Internet speeds. The agent was nice and helpful. As of now I have my son room unable to connect a simple ps4, and another streaming device from his room. So much for the so call fastest Internet.

So sick of your ads that state you have stellar service. It's all trash and you guys know it. I'll be calling in a bit to make you aware of my plight."

His initial response before I could even finish explaining to him our problem, ""You need to call another department."" After asking him to let me finish he had me send him a test email and concluded we did not have any email issue. After explaining to him that our email issues were not global but rather only isolated to a few of our clients he told me he would work on it and call me back if he figures out the problem. When I asked to speak to a supervisor he said he/she would call me back within 72 hours and that I could not have his/her name! Comcast is a joke! "
"Joao of Miami, FL","Jan. 11, 2016",1,"My internet stopped working. Called support and spent countless hours troubleshooting. Every new agent wanted to do the same tests. UNBELIEVABLE the lack of communication internally at that company. After 4 days, Comcast decided to sent a technician to check the modem. 6 days after I reported the problem, the technician arrived, did more tests and replaced the modem. All started working. To my surprise, the invoice shows up not with the 6 days credit but an extra $70.00 charge to replace the broken modem (that we rent from them). Of course, knowing how confuse they are, I called to complain. To my surprise, the supervisor told me that the charge is correct. Can someone explain to me why I am paying to replace a broken equipment that I rent from Comcast. Again, sign of a desperate company trying to exploit its customers while it can. Of course, not for long. I am cutting the cord."
"james of Lakewood, WA","Jan. 11, 2016",1,"First and foremost, Comcast is the worst company I have ever encountered. Why in the hell will they ask me to pay $119 dollars for internet and tv cable every month when I'm only getting a hundred channels. The internet connection sucks. Called them about increasing the speed and all I hear is some silly comments like ''are you using more than one device"". Ok so if I'm using two devices at the same time what does that have to do with your internet speed? Doesn't make any sense when I'm paying a hundred and nineteen dollars with low speed internet connection and half tv channels. These guys are so dumb as hell. What they should be saying is if multiple people living next room from you are using a wireless b device, that can slow down your internet connection. But no one tells you anything but force you to pay these crazy monthly fees."
"Margaret of Niles, MI","Jan. 7, 2016",1,"I called this company many times in regards to being overcharged, and finally, in December I thought these people had it all sorted, and I seen my bill of +45 then a week or so later I look at my bill and it is almost $400 after telling me I would be paying $131 monthly for the triple play. This company is a rip-off and one of the worst companies I have ever had to deal with. The customer service, I just called, and finally got to talk to a human, and when I told her about my bill, she put me on hold without warning, and I am still on hold 10 minutes later. The customer service is the worst. I have endured trauma and stress as a result of being repeatedly raped by this crooked company and have paid well more than what their reruns are worth. Unfortunately, we are forced against our will to use this service provider. I hope one day in the near future someone will put them out of business, an honest company."
"Erick of Mascot, TN","Jan. 7, 2016",1,"Upon looking for internet providers in the area I was faced with one option: Comcast, so I got Comcast. From the very beginning there were service problems, low connectivity, no connectivity, on demand services didn't work or froze, they replaced the line from the pole to the house, the junction at the house, the amplifier near the house, everything, and for years we had problems. Calling customer service is very similar to willingly subjecting yourself to having bamboo slivers jammed under the fingernails. Finally we relocated and have been able to use another provider. The difference in customer service is amazing, few problems all speedily resolved and have not recurred. AT LAST we were free from Comcast, but alas, today I received a notice that I should be receiving a refund. I called simply to ask if the refund would be electronically credited to my account or by check. First I got passed to computer sally, who decided should couldn't solve the issue, then to an Agent, but the wait was very long so I was given a callback. Twenty minutes later I am called by an individual who is probably not actually capable of writing his own name intelligently, who fumbles around for a few minutes before transferring me to someone else, which took 21 minutes to connect with, turns out the lady I was transferred to was not able to view my account because it isn't an active account (even though they didn't need to access my account because it was a simple question), then transferred to the proper person. SO in conclusion if you are considering Comcast as a service provider please be aware that any problem however small will require a soul crushing amount of excrement wanting to be resolved."
"Tracy of Waretown, NJ","Jan. 4, 2016",1,For the past year I have had ongoing issues with Comcast the X1 Service. There's been over 28 visits to my home with the Field Service Department and their Line Department. It keeps going back and forth to both Departments. They have replaced everything in my home and also all the lines outside of my home. As of today 1/3/2016 the issues are still happening. Comcast Corporate office is telling me that there is nothing else that Comcast can do to correct my service. Several Techs from Comcast told me that they have been having major issues with the X1 service and that I should cancel that service and keep what I had over a year ago. Comcast said they care about their customers. Well that's a crock of bull. I just want my cable to work for 1 day without having any issues with their service that they CANNOT RESOLVE OR CORRECT. And if you don't pay your bill on time they will turn your cable off without any regrets.
"Clara of Richwood, TX","Jan. 3, 2016",1,"Comcast customer with Xfinity On demand, movies freezes. I have purchased movies and I am unable to download. The box has been replaced. Save your money."
"Raj of Midlothian, VA","Jan. 2, 2016",1,"Slow and often dropped internet connection. The pictures on my TV is all distorted and X1 keeps rebooting. The telephone customer service is a joke. They ask for all verification, then they ask for MAC address of modem, then they reset the modem, and then throw up their hand and transfer you to another bot in Mars. The circus continues till the line is disconnected. Then you have start at the beginning. I have had the technician come out three times. This technician told me that the problem was up on the road box. Still no resolution. The cable from the road box is still on my driveway after 4 months. There is no way to escalate the problem above the minion level. Is there a way to get out of this contract and this nightmare?"
"Kenneth of Ridgeland, MS","Dec. 29, 2015",1,"I called because of notice that I had reached my internet usage limit. I'd never heard of a limit on my account. Additionally, I wanted to review my contract as the limit was shocking. I was sent to one department that informed me that the limit had been on the account from the beginning. This was after 5 verifications and transfers and a hold time of over 20 mins.Then, they informed me I'd have to call back to discuss the account. I phoned back, waited on hold for over 45 minutes to be informed that I was not authorized on the account. What? I'd just been verified 5 times. The fact that we've added my name to the account 5 times doesn't matter. I asked for a supervisor and waited on hold for another 5 minutes only to be hung up on. I've never written a review of Comcast, but their products are ok and their customer service really sucks and that has been my experience with them for all the years I've been a customer."
"J. R. of Jupiter, FL","Dec. 28, 2015",1,"I have a home in Jupiter FL that was previously my Father's. He passed away 3 years ago in November (2012) and I am now the owner of this home and the caregiver of my adult Developmentally Disabled sister, who loves to watch TV and movies. Every year for the last 3 years, like clockwork, my cable boxes go out and I cannot watch TV. Our cable is basic, and is included in our Homeowners Association fees. We do not have any add-ons or premium channels, DVR boxes, etc. Just the basic cable that comes with HOA.Every SINGLE month, like clockwork it goes out. Every single month I call to see why it is out and they can NEVER find MY account. When I give them my phone number they have NO record of it. If I give them my social security number they locate an account I had from an apartment in Delray Beach and then a condo in Deerfield Beach, which both have been long gone, for MANY years. They tell me they cannot delete or close those accounts. Mind you, there is NO balance on those either.They give me a different account number every month that I call and when I give it to them the next month, that this happens like clockwork, those never work either! When they finally locate the account through the box numbers, they tell me there is an open balance, that has not been paid. They claim that balance is owed by my deceased Father, because he is still in possession of said boxes. Are they kidding me? Every month I explain, he did not run off with your boxes, he DIED. His cable was paid through his HOA and has since been transferred to a new account, which is under MY name and there is NO balance, because I now have the equipment, which is INCLUDED in our plan that the HOA has with XFinity. No one ran off with your boxes they are still in use!Every MONTH they turn the cable off, EVERY month they cannot find my account and they have even had technicians OUT TO MY HOME to install and fix the boxes. I am self employed, and EVERY month I have to call them, and spend a minimum of 3 hours on the phone, and speak to at least a dozen people explaining this situation to EVERY one of them apparently none of them seem to speak to each other within their own company. One time I even waited ALL day for a technician to come to my home and at 8pm they still hadn't shown up they never came! This has not only cost me a considerable amount of money, since I am self employed and not tending to my OWN clients or business, but it has caused SEVERE mental anguish of having to rehash the fact that my Dad is deceased, not running off with their petty cable boxes, and also calming my Developmentally Disabled sister down from not being able to watch television.This is EVERY month without fail. WHY they can't seem to straighten this out after 3 years and 2 months at this point, is beyond me? How long with this go on? We even tried closing my Father's account and reopening a new one in my name with the equipment and it STILL is happening? What if an entirely different owner moved in with a new name and lived at this address? Cable is still provided by the Association regardless of the owner, so what is the issue?Just today, after speaking with them for over 2 hours and literally 10 people, my phone call was disconnected and they never called back. When I called them back, I got a completely different person, who could not speak English and did not understand me (I speak very clear English as I was born and raised American.). I had to repeat my name, phone number, address, account number and serial number on the equipment a minimum of 3 times, speaking very loud and clear. Again, they had no trace of my phone number or information, nor of my equipment as I stood here reading the off the number to her from THEIR receipt from when they installed it. Mind you above I said that in the previous phone call they located me THROUGH the cable box serial numbers. This is COMPLETE insanity! They threw me on hold again for another 30 minutes and when the next rep picked up, she said her name then disconnected me. OMG, this was over 3 hours of telephone hassle and it is STILL NOT resolved. OMG!!! To add to this, I, or our HOA, has never received so much as a free movie for our time and troubles, much less a refund for the time our service was off. If I had their TV service for barely an hour, you can rest assured that they would send me a bill for it at this point, XFinity Comcast Cable should be paying US for our time, trouble and all the outings we have experienced. My rate per hour for my business is $100 per hour, as of this morning alone, they cost me $300 in lost wages alone, not to mention how upset I am over this, reassuring them that my dead Father hasn't stolen their boxes, and calming down a grown adult with the mind of a 5 year old. This is horrendous... I can't go through this with this XFinity Comcast Cable, such an awful company any longer not another month, not another minute!"
"Xiaoqing of Valparaiso, IN","Dec. 26, 2015",1,"They mis-charged and double charged my service!!! I returned my modem and stopped my service 4 months ago but they just keep sending bills to my mailbox. I never use their service since 4 months ago but why they charged me for that? When I calling them, they can't explain where those bills come from and keep telling me ""don't worry"". I mean this is so irresponsible. I double checked my receipts many times and I don't know what is what. They can't explain these for you either. Avoid their ** service if you can. And those customer services' accent over the phone?? Give me a break!!!"
"first of Manchester, NH","Dec. 22, 2015",1,I started with Comcast 2 years ago and when I started I was paying $89/mo. Before the first year was up I moved and got another good deal to change addresses. After That year my bill jumped to $160. I called to see about changing plans and they gave me BS deals that were a lot less service for only a few bucks cheaper. Turns out once you are a customer then they no longer care about you and will not offer you anything better. Only new customers get better service rates. Only problem is they are the only ones that service internet in my area. Such a scam.
"Amanda of Shoreview, MN","Dec. 22, 2015",5,"Brittany was knowledgeable, professional and friendly! I tried finding a way to contact comcast/xfinity directly to let her boss know what an outstanding job she did coming to my home and fixing my cable and internet, but couldn't find a place to do so. She made me feel very comfortable with her in my home and I was amazed at how well trained and knowledgeable she was. She went above and beyond just making it work again. She shortened our cords and switched out older connection parts etc. She was very sweet and spoke very highly of her job. I have not been that thrilled with certain aspects of service with xfinity, the price spike, glitches etc, but she made the fix so easy and comfortable for us, so much so that my opinion of this company has changed for the better. This girl deserves recognition and a raise. She really is a gem and Comcast/Xfinity are lucky to have her in the field! (Techs name was Brittany/Britney... north metro MN)"
"Mike of Saint Paul, MN","Dec. 22, 2015",1,"Here's the recap of our joyous experience and ongoing saga. I've had well over 15 hours of customer service calls, fun times! We switched our business to a home office and cancelled residential account yet were still billed for about 6 months on the residential account. The offshore tech support in the Philippines that I generally always get sent to has really poor English communication skills. We were told that we would be credited for the past 6 months of being double billed and that credit would go to our business account yet our service was shut off for being unpaid and having an outstanding balance. Internet continues to get packet loss issues and the service is about as reliable as my 28.8 kb/s AOL service in 1996."
"Ashley of Nashville, TN","Dec. 22, 2015",1,"I can't believe I didn't do the research before getting internet. Working with Comcast/Xfinity has been the WORST decision I've made in my adult life. I am trying to review my bill with somebody, and I have been redirected to 4 different departments. Apparently, it is nobody's job (in Billing) to discuss my bill with me. Altogether, I have spent over two hours on hold trying to talk to somebody. I created an account with Consumer Affairs just to post a review about Comcast. I am upset and disappointed in every aspect of this service, but mostly I am disappointed in myself for not doing my due diligence. If I had, I would see that thousands of people have already been through this. If you are looking to use Comcast, STAY AWAY."
"Stephen of Miami, FL","Dec. 20, 2015",1,"I am writing on behalf of my housemates who are switching this week to ATT. After renting a Comcast modem for years, they purchased a new model (Modem-router combo) at BestBuy. It set up quickly and worked fine. Two months later, they were still being charged the monthly modem rent. After a phone call to get credit, the internet immediately stopped. After about five hours of Comcast blaming the new modem, the service began again. This month, the housemates see that they are still being charged so they called for the credit again. Immediately after the phone call, the internet service stopped. Comcast blamed the modem again and the service has now been out for about 48 hours. Phone calls are passed around and after telling the story, Comcast will ask questions about THEIR modem - obviously not paying attention or just playing mind games to prevent their own boredom. The modem is sending a SIGN-IN page signal to any device which tries to access the WIFI. Putting in the name and password do not do anything. All their suggestions (unplugging, waiting, etc) do nothing. It is so obvious from what has transpired (WIFI working perfectly followed by billing complaint followed by internet service shutting down, two months in a row) that this is just malicious behavior on their part."
"Saquan of Charleston, SC","Dec. 20, 2015",1,"Ordered internet on DEC 09. They said we can install it ourselves. Received it on the 11th. Would not work. Was told to come and switch the products. Exchanged the items. It still wouldn't work. Had to schedule a tech to come out. He came out on time and said it worked. I asked him to show me. He showed me from his phone. When my son tried to connect to the internet it wouldn't work. Called tech support. Was told someone else had to come out. Will be here before 9 pm. I called to see if they was coming. I was told by a supervisor that the person basically lied to me and they will try to come out in the morning. I'm like really I took off today and I was suppose to go in in the morning. He said ""I Dont know what time or if they will come."" Mad is and understatement. They Dont care about the people who they call customers. I open my mailbox. I already have a bill for services I have yet to use."
"kath of Panama City Beach, FL","Dec. 18, 2015",1,"I obtained a bundle service from Comcast to include TV, internet and Home Security. One would assume the contract for all services within the bundle would end at the same time. WRONG!!! TV and Internet service ends after 2 years BUT Home Security is 3 years! I will be charge $770.00 at the end of my 2 year TV & Internet contract to cancel the Home Security service or I must keep home service for the remainder of the contract."
"Serkan of Concord, CA","Dec. 18, 2015",1,"This November, when I called Comcast to transfer my account from the east coast (Wilmington, Delaware) to the west coast (Concord, California), I found out that I was being charged for modem even though I had my own modem since 2010. The customer service agent informed me that they started charging me last year, April 2014. The total amount at the time of the call was $166. The customer service agent submitted a ticket for that amount to be credited back to me. I was happy. Then I called in December (from California after my move) and found out that my ticket was denied. Comcast's reason for declining was I was supposed to check my bill. I am absolutely furious. When I returned the modem from Comcast back in 2011, I had a paperwork stating that I returned the modem and I made several calls to ensure they took it off the bill which they confirmed. After that, I let my auto-pay pay my bill and I did not care to check my bill every month. Comcast made an error. They added modem to my bill in April 2014. And now they are denying responsibility for their error and blaming for not checking my bill. It's like saying if the customer fails to check his bill every month, Comcast can get away with adding charges to the bill."
"Chandramohan of Seattle, WA","Dec. 17, 2015",1,"Last 2 years I have been paying 66.95 usd for only internet service in seattle, WA area. Still everyday internet connections go off and on momentarily, sometimes show limited internet connection and netflix in my TV won't start. Most bizarre thing is if I call other internet providers, they say - only Comcast services this address and so you are stuck or totally screwed... What kind of ** this is. And these Comcast daytime looters keep charging me so much providing ridiculous service. If anyone knows where to file a complaint or something, please let me know. This experience is going beyond frustration!!! "
"David of Pearland, TX","Dec. 16, 2015",1,"So I went online to look at local offers for Xfinity internet service to see what other deals they are offering (I got some sales flyers in the mail for Triple play with rebates or free tablets). I am only interested in internet service as we've gotten away from pay TV and stream with Hulu+ and Netflix. The offer on the screen (which I captured in a screen shot) said $49.99 per month for 12 month with a 1 yr agreement for 150 Mbps service. I click the drop-down and change it to ""No Term"" and the price changed to $59.99 per month for the first 12 months. I'm happy with the deal so I call in on the number from the flyer to set up the install. All goes downhill from there...They tell me that is California pricing and I shouldn't be seeing that offer. They asked if I put in my address and I said ""no, it didn't ask me to."" So long story short they won't honor what they have plastered on their website. Companies just have no sense of Customer Service anymore. I told them never mind and hung up. Guess I will stick with AT&T UVerse. I have my business service with them as well. I will be cancelling that later this month too."
"Faith of Hiram, GA","Dec. 16, 2015",1,"I am so frustrated with Comcast. I had business service and had to close my business. When I called Comcast to cancel, I was informed that the early disconnect penalty would be over $1000.00 because I was in a three year contract. Small business fail every day... So why would Comcast require a 3 year contract with such a massive penalty? So I called back 9 times - put on hold for extremely long periods of time trying to get some options. I was given a business rep's name for the Dallas area and she hung up on me when I explained my situation. I called back and left three messages and she never called back. Finally, after paying the bill for 4 months with no service, a customer service rep advised me to transfer the business account to my residence... Which I had to add Internet and pay double the price... I agreed to do that. I still have to add cable separately because business service in your home does not uncle cable (another additional cost). I finally got the service installed (Internet and phone) after a missed appointment that I took off work for. Now that the phone is installed, I disconnected the residential phone. I have NO phone service throughout the home, only in one room. I called Comcast and was told that business service only works on one phone. What?!? Seriously?? Why would the rep suggest transferring service if I could only have service in one room? Why wasn't I informed of that? Now I have no monitoring for my security system. Again, Comcast provided no options! I cannot believe this company survives with the way they treat their customers. As soon as this contract is up, I am canceling!"
"Jamiku of Nashville, TN","Dec. 16, 2015",1,"There are not enough words to express how dissatisfied I am with Comcast and their lack of service. Monday morning (12/14/2015) a gentleman came out to set up a new modem that my job had previously arranged for work at home purposes. The technician was very nice and professional. Know that the low rating is not due to the technician that came out, but for the manner in which Comcast conducts business.12/14/2015 I noticed that the cable panel box that the technician had to access in my bedroom closet was never put back together (it is still not together as I type this review). The cable wires were out and panel needs to be screwed back. I didn't want to touch this myself not knowing if any cables need to be hooked to anything specific. Called my apartment complex to see if maintenance could do it and I was instructed to contact Comcast. I thought this would be easy enough - honest mistake and they can have someone come out to get my wires, etc back to being in order. Agent told me on the phone Monday by me calling after 6 (around 6:15/6:30 when I called) that they would have someone out 1st thing the next day. Because it is considered a hazard he stated that he was going to put in an escalation ticket.12/15/2015 - I did not hear from Comcast or a technician as to a time, so I contacted Comcast around noon. The agent that I spoke with stated that someone would be out around 6 p.m. Well, no one called or showed up yesterday evening. I contacted Comcast again around 6:30 cst. I explained to the agent what happened and that I need someone out in the morning. He told me that the system will only let him put the visit down for Friday the 18th, but that he was putting a note in the system for a supervisor to contact me 1st thing the next morning (12/16) to get that appointment taken care of today, 12/16. I was not going to trust that considering the broken promises Comcast previously gave me.I spoke with an agent this morning (12/16) who put in another escalation ticket and I was to receive a call within an hour. After it being almost 2 hours hearing from no one again, I called Comcast again and asked for a Supervisor. The supervisor that I spoke with stated that she could not request for someone to come out today. She had to see the next available time which would be Friday, 12/18/2015. So - basically it seems a supervisor cannot do any more than the actual agents. For this matter to be deemed a hazard by Comcast and to have been escalated you would think Comcast would have someone here asap to place the wires that go in the panel back like they should be and to then close off the panel in the manner in which it should be. Instead - it is now Wednesday & I still exposed cable wires and whatever else is inside of that panel.The people at the top really need to look at how this company is being ran. A little common sense goes a long way. This matter could have been resolved quick & smooth. There was an honest mistake made by the person who came out on Monday. Comcast should have apologized for the matter and from there, thought outside of the box and made a special appointment to rectify a situation that was not my fault. Instead they have me, the customer, continuously call to try and get this taken care of. Not once have I received a call from a supervisor. 12/16/2015 - still waiting for someone to find it important enough to have a technician come out and fix the issue of exposed wires and panel that needs to be screwed back."
"Vanda of Delray Beach, FL","Dec. 16, 2015",1,"I have not been able to watch this video because the advertisements interrupted and then the video would not come back! Awful service!

"Lisa of Antioch, IL","Dec. 15, 2015",1,"We had a power outage in our area after which we had internet issues. Some web pages would connect some would take us to an Xfinity activation page which is strange since we do not have Xfinity (Comcast home service), we have Comcast business service. I called Thursday, Dec 10 at 2:30pm. Spent close to 2 hrs on the phone with them and they could not figure out the problem. I asked for a supervisor and she went through the exact same 2 steps the other girl did which did not solve the problem. Not to mention, the 2 steps she had me try were very simple solutions which I had already tried before even calling since I have had such an awful experience with them on other numerous occasions. They promised to have a ""Tier 2 tech"" call me back as soon as possible. It is now Tuesday, Dec 15 and I am still waiting for a call back!!! I called again today and I am now AGAIN waiting for a ""Tier 2 tech"" to call us back. Not only is their service awful but their customer service is horrible as well. They are the WORST INTERNET PROVIDER IN THE US!"
"CARL of Holly, MI","Dec. 14, 2015",1,"One of my checks that was written for the month of Oct. didn't arrive in time, so they called me and made me pay by credit card right away, so they wouldn't cut-off my service. So I paid it right away. Went to bank to try and chase down lost check. Well guess what? Comcast must have either found this check or it arrived late. So they went and cashed this check also, which should have made me good for the next month's billing cycle. Nope, I was wrong. They sent me another bill for $39.00 for a late fee.So I called them and tried to speak with a customer service person, but she could barely speak English and kept repeating the same sentence three times. It didn't seem to sink in with her so I just hung up. The only reason I went with Comcast is because my dish service does not internet where I live. Also I thought that I had signed up for the $99. Triple package. Well this package that I bought turned out to be $142.00 plus change. Boy do they lie, shame on them. Believe me if I could get out from under this package, I would."
"Jamie of Peoria, IL","Dec. 14, 2015",1,"I was set up on automatic payments and they billed me a couple times, then shut my service off because they said my card expired which it didn't, but I gave them all the info again... They said it could take like 30 or more days to update yet they didn't change anything, and then after on phone AGAIN for two hours they found out they applied it to my OLD account... and they swore it was fixed and guess what... it's still not fixed! I have updated online and over the phone and that dumb chat thing and NO ONE will help me fix it! They say well ""I just take payments... Let me transfer you..."" (again) and click! Hung up on over and over while they charge me late fees and reconnect fees though it's their fault, they don't know how to operate a business! SOOOO IRRITATING!!! I wish there was another cable company in our area that was good enough to switch to. They know there isn't so they don't care about us at all and just raise the rates every year... such a trap!!! They need a lawsuit against them. The manager there ""Sarah"" hung up on me on purpose one night, four times in a row. That was not an accident and no I was not being rude. I simply wanted to give them money and ensure they have it right this time. Ongoing for about a year now. They need to be bought out by someone that cares about their customers, and go to jail for ripping everyone off. I have never heard one good word about them. How are they still in business?! Ugh."
"Michael of Camas, WA","Dec. 13, 2015",1,"Spam filter is very ineffective. It took abut 25 minutes and three phone calls to report this to Comcast, due to their very poor phone menu system."
"Derik of Greenwood, IN","Dec. 12, 2015",1,For 5 years now I have had problems with my cable modem rebooting all the time (ALL cable modems I have used. I am up to 4 now). I called Comcast out 5 or 6 times and they could not find a problem anywhere. Still I have 5 to 6 months out of the year where I am getting disconnecting 6 to 10 times per hour. This company really does suck.
"Richard of Lemont, IL","Dec. 11, 2015",1,"Comcast, you've done it again! On 12.10.15 I called your US sales to upgrade my internet from Performance to Blast. The agent convinced me that I should purchase the Xfinity Triple Play with Extreme 150 and free Comcast phone service. I appreciated that as she was actually saving me a few dollars over my previous $250.00 per month package. I informed her that I will not require voice and that I own my own data modem. I asked her when my Extreme 150 would be available, she indicated immediately as long as I power off and on my cable modem and that the voice service would take 24 hours to activate. I was just fine with that because I do not need voice! This is where the NIGHTMARE begins! I performed the necessary steps of recycling my modem per the Comcast sales agent and was anxious to see my speed increase. Alas, there was no speed increase as shown by the Comcast Speed Test and others so I logged into my account to see what was happening. I was extremely surprised to see that my internet service was actually downgraded to ECONOMY. I noticed that my speeds started to decrease so I started an online chat session to gain assistance as the US office was now closed. I do not want to bore you with the GORY details of my chat, but after 30 minutes I was directed to contact the Activation Group. OK, I'm good with that, but why didn't my sales agent tell me that! So, I contacted the activation team, who had absolutely no idea what I was talking about! They transferred me to technical support in Manila. After one hour of tech support doing who knows what, my internet download/upload speeds were 3mb and 1mb respectively. I asked why my account showed ECONOMY as I just had purchased EXTREME 150. The representative said I indeed had Extreme 150 and my service was pending activation! I told him that's why I am talking to him as the chat agent directed me there for activation! He transferred me to billing who said the my account is pending activation, even though my online account showed that the new service was active and the phone was pending. I asked for a supervisor. Sparing you more GORY details. Two hours later, I was assured that my EXTREME 150 would be running in the morning after I powered on/off my cable modem. You guessed it! No EXTREME 150, and my account showed that I still had ECONOMY internet. As a side note, not one COMCAST representative could tell me why! So, this morning, I once again called COMCAST, because I knew that I would be talking with at US representative and I might have a shot at getting this resolved! You guessed it! After 1 hour and repeated requests to talk to a supervisor (who were all in meetings), Comcast finally revealed to me the issue! I need a cable modem with voice capabilities. Oh, by the way that's another $10.00 per month! Of course I asked COMCAST all of the right questions: Why was I not told this at the time I purchased my new package? Why was I bounced around to multiple COMCAST support representatives, of which none could help me or explain how to resolve the issue? Why does my account STILL say that I have ECONOMY internet service? Why am I able to upgrade the ECONOMY service to another level when I have already purchased Extreme 150? Interesting! Of course, I did receive apologies, but no answers to my questions. So, I am now waiting for a COMCAST modem to be shipped to my home. When I asked the sales agent to expedite shipping for me as compensation for my experience, she indicated that it will be an additional $29.99! Of course, Comcast agents had no sympathy or remediation for the 4 to 5 hours I spent on the phone, with an escalated blood pressure level! Cmon COMCAST! Give me a break and make it right! I've only been a LOYAL customer of yours for the last 20+ years and who knows how many tens of thousands of dollars! Oh, and I forgot. I have another account for which I will soon be paying extra for data over 300mb. I may as well direct deposit my check right to you!"
"Soledad of Houston, TX","Dec. 11, 2015",1,"Wow! Where to start. Always trouble with internet on a daily, the automated system is horrible. I've had my email for year since 2007 and had AT&T and Dish since. They never took away my email till now that I cancelled my residential account. Now that want to tell me it's gone forever. Exact words. After I spoke to someone and they told me they can transfer to my business account since I cancelled my home and switch to business... I dislike Comcast. They are the worst!!! But being that they're the only one that services my area I'm stuck with these idiot that are also over freaking priced."
"Hannah of Nashville, TN","Dec. 11, 2015",1,The customer service rep was so rude and indifferent. I felt as though the 45 minutes I wasted on the phone being bullied and belittled was unforgivable. I have only been a customer for 2 months! THIS IS NOT RIGHT! I will never recommend this service and as soon as I can cancel and move to a different company I will be doing so.
"Ana-Maria of Coral Gables, FL","Dec. 11, 2015",1,"I pay $140 monthly for my internet so I have high expectations to have good internet at all times. The internet kept fluctuating and not working for a couple of days while technicians came every day, they did absolutely nothing yet when my bill came at the end of the month I was still charged $70 for their services. I depend on the internet with my job and so I was not able to complete my work because of this unprofessional, incompetent internet company. When I called about my bill they said ""sorry, there's nothing we can do."" So in conclusion, Comcast keeps you from completing your work, then charges you for their problem, and then still does nothing to help their customers. Horrible in every way."
"CJ of Derby, CT","Dec. 10, 2015",1,"Unfortunately you have to choose a 1-5 star to rate. Realistically there should be negative stars specifically made for Comcast. It's humorous how horrible they are. If you love no internet, and horrible service, Comcast is just right for you! I'd say the company is comparable to the U.S government in the sense that lying, stealing, and most likely laughing about it is upheld as a virtue and probably plastered across their walls as their daily goals. On the bright side, the modem they supply you provides other uses. If you ever needed a hole in your wall, just wait until you try and use your internet or connecting with support, then take the modem, and huck it at the wall out of impending rage."
"maribel of Fulshear, TX","Dec. 8, 2015",1,"When I hired the service, they charge me for the technician coming to install the service. When I moved, they send another technician to install the equipment. He came 5 hours late and did EVERYTHING wrong. I started having troubles with the phone line, then the internet connection and the TV. After 1000 calls to tech support and a lot of incompetence, they send another technician to fix the problem. It turned out that the problem was the first technician that made everything wrong. But the worst part is that they charge me for the second technician that came to fix the work of the first one. When I called to ask for my money back their answer was that I didn't hired an insurance to cover that. WHAT!!!! I have no idea, you have to buy and insurance to fix others mistakes. I had understood it was the opposite, isn't it."
"yolanda of Austell, GA","Dec. 7, 2015",1,"I called Comcast - 1-800-934-6489 on December 12-07-2015, I complained about excessive charges billed to my account every month including bogus late fees even when they claim I brought the account current, and bogus activation fees even when the account was never interrupted. Then I called back again to request a disconnect for the entire account. At this time, I was told I was going to be charged a early termination fee, which I don't have a contract with Comcast so I don't understand why I would be charged a fee to terminate. I just need to disconnect so additional fee wouldn't apply.So I proceeded to ask to whom was I speaking with and the representative refused to give me any information to identify herself only to say her name was Willet with no ID # claiming that it was against company policy to provide me with that number which I thought was weird because I was provided with the prior ID # number from the prior CSR which I spoke with earlier. After the back and forth with refusal to identify herself, I informed her that the call was being recorded. She was concerned and put me on hold for a long period of time. Then the call was disconnected. I'm very upset my entire work day was ruin and also my issue was never resolved, now the only thing I can expect is a billed with bogus outstanding charges to my account that will probably hit my credit in error. Please help this wrong."
"Kathie of Houston, TX","Dec. 5, 2015",1,"My home internet went out, called customer service and call was dropped 10 times... These IT people are foreign and I could not understand them and they could not understand me. FINALLY after having been dropped 10 times, they said they would send someone out the next day between 8 and 10. I stayed home from work and they never showed up! A work order was never put in. SURPRISE!! I was without internet for 3 days... I depend on internet for work. This is the absolutely WORST company EVER! They want my cable business... REALLY?? Fat Chance! The Dish Network it is!!

"Eduardo of Woodstock, GA","Dec. 1, 2015",1,"I don't have internet or TV working. My husband is waiting somebody answer the phone for more than 2 hours but he won't hang out because I am recording the disrespect you guys treat us to post everywhere. My name is Adriana **. My husband name is Eduardo **. We are without internet and TV about 5 days already. Nobody answer the phone. I have an important job to do but you guys don't care. I want to see if you will give a discount for 1 week without service because you stolen my money. I pay for something I don't have. You are robbers, right? This is a crime. I know your customer service is the worst in the world. The title in internet is ""Comcast sucks."" But I want my money back now. I will report to GA Business Bureau, also Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, everywhere. I hope my husband learn the lesson. I really want to see Comcast shut the doors. That will be the happiest day of my life."
"Karen of Elkton, MD","Nov. 30, 2015",1,"Service is a joke. Have tried to establish internet service. However, discovered Comcast did not acknowledge my payment, therefore flagging an unpaid balance. Prior service was 4 years ago, payment in full to collection agency 1 year ago but still unable to establish service. Phone conversations, emails, faxed documentation, voice messages to no avail in past 6 weeks. Today, devoted time to resolving. However, was disconnected 4 times, spent 1 hour on hold (placed on hold 10 times), spoke with 8 different employees, each time explaining my problem, providing my phone number, address, and last 4 of my social. Called 2 different numbers. A third I was given was wrong, a recorded message for Chevy cha-cha??? Unable to provide call back number to speak with same person again and was told I would need to discuss with the originator 'of the ticket' who wasn't working today and person I spoke with was going on vacation. Requested another fax of proof of payment and referred back to debt collector. Really? Monopolize the area and treat customers this way? I paid my debt a year ago, recovered financially and bought a new home, now cannot even get internet. Such a shame to be treated this way."
"Keithpam of Douglasville , GA","Nov. 26, 2015",1,We've been with Comcast for years with no problems. We tried to upgrade and it has been three weeks and no upgrade. We called several times with several names and badge numbers with appointments to match. Appointments were made but not kept.
"Dale of Williamsport, PA","Nov. 25, 2015",1,"Trying to get Comcast to service your home is an unfathomable hill unless you live in an extremely populated area where they know they can get instant service from a large amount of people. I have tried to have a site survey done to see if they could provide internet service in my location. I was told this should not take more than 2 weeks at the most. I called multiple times and each representative told me the same thing, ""It should have been done by now"" and then they would mention to wait a few more days before submitting to their supervisor and they would call me back with results. After a few days, no call. I called them back and get the response ""I can't believe no ones updated you on this"". And finally they submit a note to their supervisor and promise to call me back. I call them back and after over a month of waiting and getting the same answer from each rep I'm told there was a decision showing they cannot service because they are not the cable company in the area. They gave me the name of another unheard of company. I gave that company a call to find they have been bought out by another company who currently is not offering internet in the area and the company before never offered it in the first place. I have never heard of these other companies and Comcast is the only cable company everyone including 2 people on my street has. I called back Comcast again and told them this new info and of course they opened another ticket for me which means I will have to wait another month and call over and over to have no results again. Not to mention in between I called numerous times and each rep seemed to have different information, and one time I was told no ticket for me even existed. So I hung up, called back for another rep and they found it right away."
"Don of Chicago, IL","Nov. 24, 2015",1,Comcast what a joke! I've been with Comcast for about going on two years locked in a contract! Biggest mistake of my life. Always having issues with low speed internet & picture & sound on TV!!! Comcast always have excuses for everything!!! They never take the blame!!! Recently for the last two days I have no Internet service & no TV service @ all in my place!!! I contacted Comcast headquarters and told him about my recent issues. There was no care on their end for me as a consumer.
"Robert of Indianapolis, IN","Nov. 24, 2015",1,"My wife works at home for a major energy company as a call center operator. The company provides Comcast ""business class"" service so she can log calls, report outages, and perhaps most importantly alert fire and rescue personnel during natural gas leaks and electrical power line issues. The speed varies so widely and so randomly that the VPN connection to the company systems is lost many times each day. We have had their technical people out dozens of times without any improvement.I am a computer systems analyst and also work from home often. I have AT&T DSL and have patched her into my network. While the Comcast connection will *sometimes* test with much faster speed, it is just as often much slower than the DSL connection and certainly much less reliable. I'll take slow and reliable over fast and flaky any time. Since the Comcast connection is provided by the energy company, I am not able to share any specific information other than the issues we've had and the results we have had to implement to solve the problem."
"Mohit of Redmond, WA","Nov. 24, 2015",1,Internet service got discontinued two times in last 2 weeks. They say every time that no service at your account. Tell me some other new address where service got transferred. First time after spending hours on call and visiting store and producing rental agreement to show address proof they said it will never happen again. And again after 2 weeks same thing happen again. When I called they have no history of last occurrence. They are not bothered and again ask me call again to get service transferred to my actual address. I have never shifted to any address and placed any request of transfer of service. But Xfinity keep giving this trouble and do not even bother about customer pain.
"Matthew of San Francisco, CA","Nov. 20, 2015",1,This is by far the WORST utility service provided I've ever experienced. Their support team is outsourced to India and their script reading staff is full of **. Find any other company but Comcast or Xfinity when it comes to any of your home or business utility services.
"Raj of Houston, TX","Nov. 18, 2015",1,"I was using AT&T 3Mbps internet earlier and never had any complaints, but as my new apartment has Comcast internet I went on with Comcast 6Mbps assuming I would get double the speed which is more than enough for me. But I noticed that I could not do Facetime, stream music or have fast browsing etc, then I did a speed test to realize that I was only getting a max speed of 1-2 Mbps and never more than that when I am paying for 6 Mbps. I called the customer care, and they tried trouble shooting and they said ""You should get at least half the speed,"" and that's the max they can do. I was SHOCKED. They also mentioned that my package is 25 Mbps which was hard to believe, and they did something from their end to get 6 Mbps speed which was only for some time. When I checked the speed in the evening the story repeats, so I called them next day and they said they will send their technician to troubleshoot. Asked me to signup for their Service Plan, otherwise they may charge me for the technician visit. Technician came, checked the speed and went on call for 15 mins to come back and say that my package is 6 Mbps and so they can't guarantee more speed (1-2 Mbps) which was very disappointing. He says, ""WiFi is like that. We can't do anything."" Such a lame excuse from XFINITY. I thought I would try for few more weeks, but it is no better.I am very disappointed to waste the Installation charges ($49.99) and the modem cost ($140) which was again suggested by them. Stay away from Comcast XFINITY."
"Toliy of Sacramento, CA","Nov. 15, 2015",1,"I've had Comcast internet service for over a year. After a year of dealing with their Customer service, (probably outsourced in the Philippines) I will be looking for another provider. Comcast is charging way too much for a service that they hardly deliver on. Why is it so difficult to keep my internet functioning? Why do my speeds vary so much? Is there a department of evil minions that intentionally keep decreasing my internet speed in hopes that I will not notice?"
"Ryan of Sewell, NJ","Nov. 12, 2015",1,I signed up with xfinity and had no working service for 37 of the first 44 days. I called everyday trying to get it to work. In addition to not having the service they had a line running across the front of my yard that was not buried and 2 kids tripped over it. They still did not send anyone out to fix that. With my bill I was charged for the installation fee of $350 upfront when it was supposed to be monthly. When I attempted to get that fixed they charged me an additional $350 plus the $58 monthly fee. I have called numerous times to fix it and when I show my frustration the call magically hangs up and nothing gets accomplished. I have spent over 10 total hours on the phone and have a bill for over $600 still. Do yourself and stay away they are frauds because I heard them same story from 3 different people.
"John of Orlando, FL","Nov. 11, 2015",1,"Comcast's internet is bafflingly unreliable. To make matters worse, they have an absolute monopoly in my area. This means that no matter how poor their customer service or how unreliable their internet, they are the only option. I hope that Comcast understands that if Google Fiber ever comes near here, I'm willing to move just to get away from their Xfinity garbage."
"Christine of Oak Park, IL","Nov. 9, 2015",1,I initially signed up for internet only - 105 Mbps at a new customer rate of $39.99. That same evening I decided to add cable. After multiple calls with Customer Service I was finally quoted a double play package at a reduced rate. I called the day before my installation to confirm the channels I was suppose to get. After the guy hooked everything up and left I realized I wasn't getting all the channels so I called customer service. I spent over an hour on this call just to be sold a different package at a higher price. I was also told by the Supervisor that they are not responsible for what the consumer are sold/told by customer service and they wouldn't honor it.They pulled the calls but after the first call he was bored and offered me a $40.00 credit for 3 months but that would only be for the new upgraded package. I contact customer service again Monday morning and was made to feel like I was just creating my own price points. I've filed a claim with the BBB. I felt like this was clearly a bait and switch scheme by Comcast
"Amie of Westover, WV","Nov. 6, 2015",1,"Tried to sign up for Comcast, but after waiting 4 weeks for the installer to show up, called to see what was going on, and was told that our address didn't exist in their system. Never mind that the house has been there for 60 years, or that they could find the address just fine when we were signing up and said they'd send someone within a week... Went to ** and found that we could get Frontier, so ordered that instead."
"Paul of Santa Fe, NM","Nov. 6, 2015",1,"Hello everyone. I have been a Comcast customer for the past 4 years. Comcast has great services but don't work good with its customers. I recently go divorced and had to take the service with me. I could no longer afford the services I previously had with them and I called them to see if they were able to help me. The representative told me he would help me get a deal to help. I ended up with a package that cost $40 more and at first I thought maybe it's the startup cost. So I finally got my new bill and that was the new price. So I call them and let them know. They told me there was nothing they could do. I'm stuck paying the new price and on top of that they gave me a new 2 year contract. So now to cancel, they want me to pay close to $1000.00 to leave their company."
"patrick of Dunnellon, FL","Nov. 6, 2015",1,"Today I received a letter from Sears canceling my long term credit relationship with them because I had a collections issue with Equifax. After looking at my credit file, Comcast turned me in for collections on an account I have never had with them. The account was not mine and how could they report me without my SS number is beyond me. It has now taken my credit score down almost 100 points and I am fighting it."
"Brian of Mechanicsburg, PA","Nov. 5, 2015",1,"Company is very horrible to deal with, get a runaround on answers, company offers promotions that Comcast reps don't know about, add one feature for $10 - my bill jumps $30. Calling in to get assistance is a joke - having to use the voice answering machine. Get overseas reps that can't understand English and get mixed up by the language barrier. Don't actually get the package at the price promised and more fees that shouldn't be on. Absolute horrible to deal with!! So frustrated! "
"Marissa of Pearland , TX","Nov. 3, 2015",1,"I have had nothing but trouble since I opened my account with them in July. I have had to call them multiple times to deal with NIL to non-Internet speeds (I pay for blast internet). Their excuse was my equipment wasn't working properly (I have my own cable modem and router). I had Netgear run a diagnostic check and my modem was running slow so I purchased a new one that was more than capable of handling our Internet speeds. Yet, the issue continued. In September the Internet was running very slow. Then completely stopped working. I called multiple times spoke to multiple representatives and was ultimately lied to. One representative said they'd compensate me cable and that she would dispatch a tech to meet me by 2:00 on Saturday. I waited all day. They were a no show. I call back and speak to another representative who informs me that they don't comp free cable and the prior rep hadn't put in a service order and the prior rep had also completely changed our plan! I finally get everything settled after multiple line exchanges (or so I thought). They finally decided that the Internet issue was with them and the new rep said she would send out a tech to hook up my new cable TV and check on the Internet (FREE OF CHARGE). A lady in billing also told me to call back once the tech had finished and my services were working so I could be compensated for the days I didn't had Internet. The tech shows up right at 8. He was friendly. He explained that the cable had been undone outside (not my fault at all). He also said that my modem and router were capable of handling the speeds I am suppose to be receiving (when I call and complain they blame my modem and router). He gets the Internet installed then asks where my cable TV box is. I told him I hadn't received one. He said it was no biggie he had one in the truck (the one they mailed came a few days later and after calling them they said I had to return it to a UPS store to ship back, another waste of my time). He gets everything hooked up and running, I'm a happy camper! I then call billing and explain my story (which is of epic proportion). She agrees to compensation not as much as I deserve for a month of slow and then no Internet, not to mention the hours of wasted time on the phone with them! She tells me my $35.00 compensation will occur on my following bill. So imagine my surprise when I open my bill for October and it's double what it normally is. Their excuse is they forgot to apply my $35.00 credit. They also charged me for an Internet install (I already had Internet when the tech came!!!) and to install my cable tv. I was told it would be FREE because it was their services that were messing up. The representative tells me she can't remove the $70.00 service charge because they have to investigate it and she also can't add two charge reduction for 1 billing cycle! So I have to pay $40.00 extra this month for Xfinity's **! I am sick and tired of having to call at least once a month about a problem! It also is absurd that they have no way of keeping track of who you've spoken with. They also have no way to call and speak to the same agent! If you want to overpay for craptastic speeds and the worst customer service ever, this is the company for you!!!"
"ada of Olive Branch, MS","Nov. 3, 2015",2,"Comcast had triple play for about 8 years. Never got a bill over 140 monthly plus tax.

Very unsatisfied customer now. When Comcast take the cap off WiFi, will return again."
"Rey of Livermore, CA","Oct. 31, 2015",1,"Comcast internet service is unreliable. The internet speed is not what they claimed to be. I am only getting 3-5 mbps most of the time and always froze my internet connection. When you call their executive customer service, the calls get dropped the moment you complained about the problem. No more Comcast for me, sorry this is not the kind of service I should be getting from a customer who pays on time."
"Adam of Goose Creek, SC","Oct. 29, 2015",1,Paying for over 100 mbps bandwidth... Getting less than 20 mbps and that's in the best place. I tested all over the (small) house getting down to about .2 mbps in the worst place. Comcast robs their customers.

"Ian of Denver, CO","Oct. 28, 2015",1,"By far the worst internet service you can get. I was suppose to get the top speed and only certain times of day which is only like an hour will you get those top speeds. Additionally the service constantly has outages usually when you need the internet the most. THE WORST COMPANY ever who does nothing to make it right with customers. Now they are talking about and implementing in certain states Data Caps. So ridiculous, of course a terrible company like GE owns this terrible company. There are so many other alternative options for internet. Avoid signing up with Xfinity at all costs! You have been warned! They don't even deserve One Star!"
"Travis of Tomball, TX","Oct. 27, 2015",1,"AS the only high-speed internet provider in my area I am forced to do business with Comcast (DBA Xfinity). They are a complete nightmare to do business with. I had an installation performed on October the 21, 2015; They left the cable laying on top of my lawn, telling me it would be buried within a week. More than a month later I am still spending 30 minutes to an hour a week on hold with their customer service trying to get them to come bury the cable (a service I already paid for with the installation fee). Every time I call they give me a ticket number and tell me I will receive a call the next day to schedule the service. Each time I get a call telling me the cable will be buried in about 5 days as still the cable sits there.I am now getting nasty notes from my HOA about the cable so today I asked for a supervisor to speak with. I have been waiting on hold for more than half an hour now... Still no supervisor. In my experience this company has zero sense of pride or accountability. Every representative I have spoken to during the last month gives the impression that I am somehow at fault for their continuing failure to do what they have been paid to do."
"Jason of West Monroe, LA","Oct. 27, 2015",1,"So I had Xfinity internet service only at my home. I was paying 49.95 per month plus 10.00 for equipment rental so a total of 59.95. One day my bill increased to 89.95 plus the 10.00 so I called in to cancel the service as I had other companies I could choose for half that price. I was told how ""sorry"" they were that I wished to cancel and wanted me to speak to a customer retention agent, so I agreed. I was told that while they could not lower JUST my internet, they could give me cable AND internet for 69.95, so basically the same thing but I would have cable as well. So I agreed...and this was where the nightmare began.They sent me a home install kit which I did and it never functioned. I was told after an hour of troubleshooting on the phone that the box appeared to be faulty so take it to the closest Comcast office and they would replace it. I did this. It too did not work. So finally they sent out a technician. He found an issue in the box outside that he rectified and the service now worked, HOWEVER he also told me I had an unnecessary booster amp on my service which he had removed so I should now have the best service I could get. He left. From that moment my internet did not work, it constantly lost signal. So they sent out a second tech two days later, who came in my home and said ""Oh they are sending the wrong rate code to your modem, so I have had that rectified and it's good now"". He left and it still did not work. So a third tech came out. This time he verified I had poor signal and but was unable to fix the issue. He said he believed maintenance would need to come and change out the cable from the house to the street which was then scheduled for the following wed. The automated call to make sure I was home happened at 2pm Wed to ensure I would be home from 3-5pm. I got home and waited. 5.30 came and no tech. I called and was told, ""oh we have you scheduled for Friday"". I asked then ""why did your system call me to verify I was home?"" He then told me ""oh it looks like you were scheduled for Wed pm but we moved it to Friday"". SO now I am waiting Friday and he comes out and changes the wire from the street to the house and...NO FIX. So A few days later the next tech comes out (now I have had 4 techs and 24 days of no service and I have had to take of 4 half days from work) so here we are another half day missed from work and a 5th tech. This guy doesn't even work from Comcast. He works for a local cable installer that they subcontract. He checks it all and then says ""You Need an amp"" (which I had prior to the original tech coming out to install cable). He added it and the issue was resolved. THEN I got my bill!!!So despite being told of the credits I would be getting for no service, failed technician calls and missed appointment it was not 79.95, it was $245.00!!! They charged me for the call outs. I called to complain and was told they were not going to credit me so I lost 2.5 days of work, 24 days of service and was charged a small fortune because of their own incompetence. I spent a combined total of 13 hrs and 47 mins on the phone with them (not included the first three calls I made which I didn't record the times on) but I estimate that brings it to 16 hrs or so..."
"Daniel of Orlando, FL","Oct. 26, 2015",1,"Salesman came to my house offering a better service, better price than my current provider. They said to test them for 30 days, money back guarantee. Service sucks, 75mbps never had more than 10mbps. On the second day, had no service in the morning. I disconnected the service a week later, and now they want me to pay a bill for $53. The money back guarantee is a lie, they made me go thru a lot of time with customer relations department for nothing. I will not recommend this people to anyone."
"Charles of Mt Pleasant, TX","Oct. 26, 2015",1,"In July of 2015 I moved from Bellevue, WA to Mt Pleasant, TX. I turned in all of my Comcast equipment at the Comcast Service Center in Factoria, WA. I was badgered for nearly an hour about transferring my account to Texas even though Comcast doesn't provide service to my Texas address. Comcast continued to bill me for service, threatening to turn me over to collection if I didn't pay the July and August bill. They agreed that I had turned in the equipment but had not requested service termination.After several conversations with various customer service reps and being told that I would have to pay the late fee even though I didn't owe the bill, I gave up. I guess they came to their senses because they quit billing me. On October 25, I attempted to log into my email account and received an ""ACCESS NOT AUTHORIZED"" message. I called customer service and a very rude representative explained that 30 days after termination of service, all email service was terminated. He said that I should check the terms of service that I agreed to when I signed up for my email account (that was in 1995!). I explained that my business depended on that email and asked if I could at least get access long enough to transfer my contacts and my recent emails. I was told that all records had already been destroyed. That's difficult to believe since I had accessed my email the previous day.I requested to speak to a supervisor and was told that ""it wouldn't do me any good"". However I insisted and after a great deal of resistance, and 25 minutes on hold, someone who claimed to be a customer service supervisor answered and in very poor broken English, questioned me about my problem. She then stated that she needed to do further research and asked if she could call me back in just a few minutes. At my suggestion, not hers, she took my number, repeated it back and hung up. No call back was ever received."
"lakisha of Union City, GA","Oct. 26, 2015",1,"Over the last two weeks I have attempted to reach your collections department to assist me with setting up Internet Essentials and have a block removed from my residents because I did meet the requirements. I have been mishandled, misrouted, and experience unprofessional customer service over 13 times in the last 2 weeks in an attempt to resolve this matter. Your representatives have refused to allow me to speak with supervisors and I've handled myself in a very professional manner. However they still refuse to assist me in this matter."
"Brandon of Pheonix, AZ","Oct. 24, 2015",1,"Ok, so I've had Xfinity/Comcast for almost a year now, and there has been so much trouble, I can't stand Comcast. So you are probably thinking of getting it from the commercials saying Xfinity is faster than a NASCAR pit stop. All the commercials got me hooked. I purchased the ""X1"" version, which has ""double"" the high speed internet than the normal one, and it's faster than Fios. They set it up, no hassle, only internet speed was the problem. I was supposed to be getting 5 bars and like 100mbps speed, but that turned out to be a lie immediately. My phone, computer, and Xbox were even slower than before I got it. My phone only gets 2 and 1 out of 3 wifi bars and it's a 5s brand new. Whenever I use my Xbox, It barely connects to Xbox Live, and when it does, it isn't very fast and will end up lagging me out anyways.... The broadband strength is very weak and you can't even have 2 computers on at once without slow trouble, nonetheless you can have a couple smartphones on it. My upload speed is now about 3-4 mbps and my download speed is 8, maybe even 10 mbps sometimes (According to speedtest.net). Even worse, my ping never dips below 100. I hate having to tell all my friends my internet speed and be the blame for ""lag switching"" the game with my internet. Hopefully, I may be switching to Fios soon, which ACTUALLY has good internet. So in conclusion, don't invest your time into these guys and go and get something that won't keep you behind."
"John of Philadelphia, PA","Oct. 24, 2015",1,"I signed up for a week pass for Xfinity wifi for 19.99. I live in center city Philadelphia (where Comcast headquarters is located). This wifi service isn't even half as fast as the 3g data on my phone. And monthly, it costs about as much as a high speed internet service. The connection constantly drops out and I'm less than a mile from the Comcast building. I guess I'm just going to go back to using my phone plan's 3g data for its superior speed and reliability. I'm not one to normally write internet reviews but I'd like to join in on the effort to pile on Comcast. The fact that a company can provide such terrible services and be so successful is appalling."
"Susan of Fort Myers Beach, FL","Oct. 23, 2015",5,"COMCAST! Please accept my apology for not believing your customer service agent! Thank you for all you did to help me get the service I expect! No one likes to call any cable company's customer service... EVER! Endless waits, repeated requests to speak to agent only to be ignored, and they lie to you, right? WRONG!!! I thought they were trying to sell me something I did not want when they told me my own (not Comcast equipment because mine is better, right?) wifi router needed to be replaced, then offered to sell me one. I didn't believe it until the router went black the next day. I had been putting up with what I remembered to be a few years old router (it was at least 10!) blaming Comcast for my inadequate and intermittent reception! Your equipment does not last or perform well forever, PEOPLE! On Comcast's advice, we bought a new Motorola SurfBoard 6580. Not the latest and greatest, but more than sufficient to handle my upload and download requirements with computers, iPhones, iPads, and DirecTV. And we got it on Ebay for half of Amazon's price and free shipping because it was refurbished and without new packaging. The supplier included sensible 1-page instructions that said, first to call your ISP (Internet Service Provider) to recognize your modem ID. I did, got Laquetia right away! I almost had to wait!!! She was kind, easy to talk to and understand, chuckled at my jokes, and fixed my modem connection immediately and stayed with me until I got to my email account! I'M SO HAPPY I COULD DANCE ALL NIGHT! Thank you Comcast!!!"
"Linda of Baden, PA","Oct. 23, 2015",1,"I just spent an entire morning on the phone with Comcast Support, to no avail! I needed help with my Comcast.net email on my iPhone, and I talked to 3 different representatives, none of whom had a clue. They each said they were escalating me to the next level, but I was either disconnected or sent to a dead-end message each time. So I spent several more hours searching the internet for the answer to my problem and finally was able to solve it myself. So frustrating. Horrible customer service! I am going to change my email provider."
"Laura of Canton, MI","Oct. 22, 2015",1,"I have never experienced such bad customer service from a company. I moved to a new city wanted to get Internet Service. They talked me into getting Internet and Phone service as it was cheaper than getting the Internet alone. They told me someone could come out in a week and half. Pretty long time but ok. The technician Andrew came out and then told me they could not install as there was no line coming to the house. There is a concrete walkway in the backyard leading to the deck. So he said a contractor would have to come out and lay a line under the concrete. Then they could come out again.So days passed no word from them. I call they say ""oh you are pending."" We will have someone call you in 24hrs to make an appointment. She calls back later and says ""oh you need a special permit to lay that line it will take two more weeks."" I tell her I really need the Internet for job related reasons. Candice says ""oh you can use Infinity wifi if you see it on your smart phone. I do so she sets me up with an ID and password.""I get off the phone and try to connect. No luck. I then talk to Danielle who tries to help me connect. She has no luck so she sends me to a technician that has more knowledge than she does. She then passes me on to a hotspot expert. Well by now I can connect but it is only like 1 mbps. So basically you can do nothing with it. She says she can't help and sends me on to the next person. I say you aren't sending me back to the very beginning. Sure enough she does. As I am talking to this person and please realize I have to tell the whole story each time I talk to a new person. This person says you can't get wifi unless you have service set up. Grrr. All that time wasted with these people. As I am talking who is in my backyard but two Comcast guys to lay the line. What happened to needing a permit or two weeks?They say the technician doesn't know what he is talking about you have a line all along. They say they will make a note about it. Just as I am getting ready to call them the next day there is a knock on the door. Three guys from Comcast are there to bury the line. What line it was buried long ago with the previous owners. No communication between the different departments. I call to them about the developments and when can they come out and connect the service in the house. They tell me it will take two weeks. I say you should give me faster service after all this hassle and a discount on my first month of service. They said ""oh we can't do that."" I say let me talk to your supervisor. They say ""oh the supervisor is not here they will call you back in two hours."" Oh by the way some technician cancelled my account so I have to start all over with a second credit check. Unbelievable. No one calls back.I call after I did not get a call back sounds like I have called Mexico with all the Spanish speaking going on. I explain the whole situation again Danny says ""Oh I have talked to the department and they will get you service tomorrow. They will call you around 10:30 am and be there by the end of the day at 6:30."" I did talk to a supervisor then and he assured me as well that someone would come the next day. He said he could not give me a discount on my account because it is not active yet. I say why don't you give me a credit on the account. He says I have to talk to accounting. No one calls the next day or comes.I call to see what happened and they say ""oh they can't tell you a specific time I am going to write them up."" I am now talking to an office in the Philippines. She says they will still have to keep the appointment 2 weeks from now but will try to fit me in sometime before that. So basically I would be on call for two weeks. Next day I call. Wow. They set me up with the Internet at a reasonable rate. Plus they came out the very next day. They came and Ken did an excellent job. Service is working great. Stay away from Comcast if you can."
"Jay of Littleton, CO","Oct. 21, 2015",1,"Absolutely ridiculous. At every level incompetent. I just wasted 3 days due to their wireless internet... Wirelessly it wouldn't connect to Exchange. Wired it does and then every day at about noon the system craps out. This after I told the installer, 3 times, where to put the cable so when I put the deck on the house I don't have to move it... Where do you think he put it?? It's sicken to deal with these people... Oh what phone number is your account associated with...? Well we have 5 phones but one Comcast number and the phone number isn't on the bill."
"Amy of Pompano Beach, FL","Oct. 21, 2015",1,"Do NOT pay for services with Comcast/Xfinity. Upon signing on with Comcast, I was very optimistic. It wasn't until I had extra charges on my account that I changed my mind. I spent months getting the charges reversed. To top it off, my internet would just stop working on a monthly basis. One tech told me that there were just too many people in my area and there was nothing they could do about it. Another told me that I would have to spend time resetting the modem every month and hope that it would come back on.8 months later, they finally admitted to giving me faulty equipment, and although I had already been to the store and waited in line, the only way to get functional equipment without being charged would be to go back to the store (which is 30 min away) and exchange the equipment. Meanwhile, I am supposed to pay for services that I am unable to utilize. Oh, my other option was to go to Walmart and buy my own personal modem. Once again... DDO NOT PURCHASE SERVICES WITH COMCAST!!!!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT"
"David of Estero, FL","Oct. 20, 2015",1,"We've had Comcast for about 2 months now. At the beginning, our cable internet service was extremely intermittent so we called Comcast to schedule a service visit. The tech came, ended up swapping out the FAULTY cable model for a new one, and told us we wouldn't be charged. Two weeks later we got a charge on our bill for $39.99 for the service visit. We've been disputing the charge for 5 days now and each supervisor we speak to says that the charge is valid. When we signed up for Comcast, we expected their service to work. It is an absurd business model to lie to customers about not charging them for a service visit and then charging them in the end. I'd go as far as saying this company is CRIMINAL. Why should customers have to pay to have faulty equipment swapped out? DO NOT SIGN UP FOR COMCAST EVEN IF IT IS THE CHEAPEST OPTION. You will be sorry if you do."
"Sam of Tucson, AZ","Oct. 19, 2015",1,"For the entire time we have been forced to have Comcast - monopolies still exist in our area - we have experienced spectacularly atrocious customer service. Our phone line has been on and off for a year and a half now. Calling to make yet another appointment with yet another incompetent service technician (the phone center is in Manila) takes a minimum of 45 minutes each time, multiple waits, transfers, and often dropped calls. Comcast then usually misses the appointment. If the guy ever arrives he consistently says the past work on the phone line was shoddy, and he spends an hour to two hours not fixing the line. He then promises to call the next day or the day after to continue the work, but never calls back.The last guy actually left his tools here, called, and then came back for them the next day and tried to fix it again. Of course he couldn't, and again promised to call the following day. He did not. When the line again stopped working I spent another hour on the phone with Comcast, made an appointment for the next day, which they did not keep. When I called to complain I was told ""they tried to reach you and couldn't."" This is, frankly, impossible because I gave my cell phone number and that would have taken a phone message if I did not directly answer it. No message was left. In other words, the technician just lied.I cannot quite encapsulate the level of awfulness that Comcast ""customer service"" embodies. If we had any option for phone service and high speed internet we would long ago have switched to ANY other entity. Comcast makes the old Ma Bell seem caring, efficient and cost-effective. I have wasted dozens of hours on Comcast, and as of this very minute I still have a non-working LANDLINE, a technology that dates back to the 19th century. Wow. Frankly, the board and leadership of Comcast should be fired, since shooting them remains illegal in America."
"Shawn of Reading, PA","Oct. 19, 2015",1,We have Comcast TV Internet and phone service. We went out of town for a week and we were Not getting calls forwarded to our cell phones. We drive around in a car wrapped in our business information. We got home and found out that our Internet TV and phone services have been shut off and switched to just basic TV only without our permission. Comcast even apologized and admitted to wrongdoing as per changing our services. Comcast gave us a free month of service and a $50 gift card with an apology note. We don't feel this is nearly enough because we lost unknown amounts of income due to this unauthorized change in service and loss. When customers would call our phone number it would say our phone number is not even in service so it made us look like we were not even in business.
"Robert of Sarasota, FL","Oct. 19, 2015",3,"I appreciate that Comcast offers xfinity for $20, although it is pretty damn slow, and unreliable. It is a nice option for a student like myself. Unfortunately, until recently I would have a hotspot through wifi free to use when the service I am paying for wanted to stop working temporarily. It would at least equal a somewhat usable service.Just the other week whenever I try accessing the hotspot it asks for my login info, and when I supply it I'm given a message my tier of service does not qualify. Excuse this lowly peasant, ComCast. I am so sorry I'm not spending $70 a month for your service to access your hotspot when the connection I'm paying for decides to be doo doo on a daily basis. I just wanted to vent this recent inconvenience, and we all know how far I would get if I had done so over the phone to their customer service, and good luck finding an email to contact ComCast at."
"Marty of Atlanta, GA","Oct. 18, 2015",2,"I was a customer with Comcast. They lied about the discount. Was suppose to have someone do the work so I could get internet service, but he didn't do the work. So, they had to send a tech over after I waited for service for four days. They said there would be no charge for the tech coming out since it was their fault that my service was not ready. Wrong! They charged me for everything. They gave me a discount for 12 months then automatically signed me up for the next year without my consent. The bill was getting higher and higher so I called them. The customer service person told me that the discount they gave me for the past twelve months was added to my bill and each month they charged extra until it was paid. How can these people get away with this? It is as though no one can stop these crooks from their crooked business dealings. I need an internet service. All of them are liars and crooks!!!"
"Malachi of Springfield, OR","Oct. 16, 2015",1,"PLEASE READ! I have been using Comcast for a while now and I have a few things to say. First of all if you're thinking about trying Comcast I would highly recommend not doing it. I live in a duplex and my neighbors recently had a Comcast technician install internet on their side of the duplex. When they did this they messed up and disconnected my internet. I tried contacting Comcast to set up an appointment to have it fixed but the earliest they could come out was nearly a week later. I requested to have it done sooner since it was their fault and they said they would give me a call within 24 hours. NO CALL WAS MADE and I randomly had a note on my door when I got home from work saying I MISSED AN APPOINTMENT. I have been without internet that I have already paid for, for about 10 days. NO compensation was offered from them and they keep putting my appointment back. HERE'S THE KICKER, instead of offering compensation and/or repair of my service, the lady tried to sell me an upgraded package!! WOW Comcast has some of the worst customer service I've seen. Definitely do not recommend using them at all."
"Robert of Hanahan, SC","Oct. 15, 2015",1,"My internet goes on and off or from a strong signal to a weak one. COMCAST has their phone system fixed so that it is impossible to speak to a person. When you choose that option the phone disconnects. I am so tired of it, I am now in the process of setting up my service for phone and internet and TV with someone else. I will not even bother to call them again. Another thing is COMCAST every year raises their prices at the minimum of 5 dollars a month and raises the lease on their boxes or modems. It is pure corporate greed and disregard to its paying customers."
"Pauline of Miami, FL","Oct. 14, 2015",1,"Comcast customer service is deplorable, complete with incompetent, rude and poorly-trained service reps. Instead of improving customer service to attract more customers, Comcast is now trying yet another dirty tactic to increase their revenues and make their customers even more dissatisfied and disgusted. There is no other company I can get ISP so I have no choice but to pay through the nose for Comcast's internet service which NEVER operates at the speed they claim.Last year I cancelled my cable TV service but continued with the internet service (since there is no other ISP in my area).Now, less than a year later, they've figured a new way to screw me - They just sent me a letter saying as of this month they are going to charge $10 per 50 GB of data I use over 300 GB per month. This is EXTORTIONATE! According to the new monitor they've installed, I already used 300 GB in the 1st week. So they offered me a way to avoid this $10 charge. I can pay them $30 a month more for unlimited data so now I'm paying $100 a month for just the internet. This is a 42% increase and I am at their mercy. I have filed a complaint with the FCC and I don't know what else to do. Aren't they violating some anti-trust laws? How is a monopoly allowed to operate? Why is this company still in business?"
"Paul of Salt Lake City, UT","Oct. 14, 2015",1,Sales rep said high speed internet was included in the package I just signed up for. I discovered I was being charged for it on the bill. I called Comcast/Xfinity and they said it wasn't included and wouldn't make it right. I then had them take the high speed internet off and they said they would credit my bill and it would show up in 24 hours and I wouldn't need to pay it. I check a few days later and the charges are still on my account. I got on a chat call with a rep and told them my story and they told me they wouldn't make it right either and that it was still on my bill and I would maybe see it on my next bill as a credit. Not a very customer friendly company and don't back up what their sales reps promise.
"eydie of Blaine, WA","Oct. 13, 2015",1,"I have spend hours and hours of my life that I will never get back. I have been trying to move my business internet & phone to the residential side in order to save money. $85+/- a month was worth it, right? I'm not so sure. I am currently on hold again. This time 41 minutes so far. I have spent 3-4 weeks, spoke with foreign and local agents & even made a trip 30 minutes away to stand in line for 20 minutes & to be told that all I had to do is activate my service.

"Quillen of Hinsdale, IL","Oct. 13, 2015",1,"I was having trouble getting my new router to connect. I called and had a very hard time understanding the agent on the other end, and she clearly could not understand what I was saying or asking either. There were times when she would just stop talking for minutes at a time. I would have to say ""hello?"" to snap her back to the phone call. After 1.25 hours on the phone and about 5 resets of the router, I said ""let me try something"" and fixed it myself. She said ""okay I'll call you back in 15 minutes to make sure it's working"" and then never called me back."
"Michael of Seaside, CA","Oct. 13, 2015",1,We have been customers with them for two years. We got the worst possible plan you can get cause they talk you into it by using misleading information that doesn't contain to the intended service. So by that I'm unhappy and switching to uverse.
"Chris of Middleburg, FL","Oct. 12, 2015",1,"On the surface, these guys seem great. Great internet speeds for a great price. Well, in reality, dealing with them has been an absolute nightmare. I recently moved to a new house (about 10 mins from my old address). I called over a week in advance of the move, and was assured the internet would be on when I moved in. Of course, it was NOT. I called several times, and each time was told that a tech would be out there ""today between 9am and 5pm"". No one showed. This went on for 3 days. Finally I contacted the corporate office, and they got a tech out.Flash forward 3 weeks. I get a call from the Home Security sales division, promising me a ""bundle"" rate that would only be $10 more than I'm paying for internet, plus a free speed upgrade (as the upgraded speed is needed to run the system). GREAT! I took the deal. And then I got my first bill. HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN OVER CHARGES. And if I choose to cancel? $600 early termination fee. After unsuccessfully dealing with their local customer service, I had to get back on the phone with corporate, who finally agreed to let me out of the contract as their own recordings prove that the sales team misrepresented the terms. Here I am, months later, still trying to get a nearly $500 bill corrected. These guys are a bunch of clowns. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THEM."
"Anonymous of Knoxville, TN","Oct. 12, 2015",1,"I have continually had very terrible service with internet speed, DVR working, and getting honest and accurate customer service. My last call tonight was 47 minutes total, 33 of them on hold. The executives do not care about either customers or employees as the last two CSRs admitted they are getting tired of hearing the same complaints about terrible service and do not like working there. Comcast employees: they make gazillions and you have to hear from customers who complain... Do you think they care about you? Until customers and employees start communicating to the execs, who are only concerned about their multimillion dollar salaries/benefits and homes on Kiawah Island, crappy service will continue. Come on America! Wake up and switch to a better company!"
"Victoria of Jblm, WA","Oct. 11, 2015",1,"My husband and I just moved to Fort Lewis a little over a month ago. We have been looking for decent priced cable and internet package. We chose XFINITY. We called and ordered and had an apt set for Oct 14th. We never received our confirmation email. So the next day we called back. It took us a few days to finally get through. Once we did the male we talked to said that whoever put our account together did not do it correctly. He fixed it and set our installation date for the 9th. Once the 9th came along they never showed up. We called again, and they said there is nothing they can do about it because in the computer it still said our apt was for the 14th. So angry we drove 30 min to the closest store to pick up the equipment to set it up ourselves. After taking the whole evening to set it up we were finally able to watch TV. But could not watch on demand (which we are paying for) and we were unable to hook up our internet, because the modem we bought had been previously returned. So now we have to go all the way back to the store to show them our receipt and modem. With all the trouble we have had not once did XFINITY try to keep up as a customer. They did not value our service. So therefore forcing us to disconnect our service to XFINITY."
"Ryndi of Tabernash, CO","Oct. 7, 2015",1,"We spent weeks working on a contract with the Denver-area Comcast to bundle our Internet and phone services. They told us that they had sent out trucks to survey our location, and that our site was serviceable. We were told this by multiple representatives - first by Amanda **, and then by Michael ** (both of whom work in the Denver corporate office in the Comcast Business Class - West Division). We spent hours working on the contract and determining which features we needed, and we took steps to cancel our current service providers. We signed the SOA, which specifically says, ""This Agreement shall commence and become a legally binding agreement upon Customer's execution of the SOA."" Soon after signing the SOA, Michael ** sent us an email saying only, ""We have just received the site survey results back for your location. Unfortunately we cannot service your location at this time without considerable construction costs. I apologize we couldn't make it work this time."" Our location is serviceable, regardless of associated costs. The fact that Comcast neglected to consider the construction costs before sending us the SOA is certainly not our fault. Why was a truck not sent out to determine the associated construction costs BEFORE our site was deemed serviceable and before we signed the SOA? Not only did Michael (and the other representatives) waste our time because Comcast neglected to check the validity of the site survey, but Michael had the audacity to inform us via a brief email. His customer service skills are atrocious.Michael ** refused to provide us with the number of a supervisor until we threatened to lodge a complaint against him if he didn't. He did finally provide the email of a supervisor, Janchessa **, and asked her to contact us regarding our complaint. Not only has this Janchessa failed to contact us, she has yet to respond to ANY of the emails we have sent her. So, not only did we waste valuable time forming a contract, but we have also endured appalling customer service from every representative we have tried to work with - Michael ** especially. The level of incompetence displayed by Comcast in the Denver area - from basic customer service to their ability to accurately interpret a simple site survey - is staggering."
"S of Dc, WA","Oct. 7, 2015",1,"I called COMCAST to get a Double Play Bundle Special. The advertisement baits you by quoting $89.00 for a double play. My final price was $133 if I wanted internet speed that actually worked. I was then quoted $79.00 for the double play bundle before all of the extras but I had to sign a two year contract. I think that it is next to impossible to get cable/internet for the advertised $79.00. Each month my bill has increased. A year later my bill is $195.00!! Each month they increase a different item on the bill. Sometimes they will actually overcharge for the number of set-top boxes that you have. It is next to impossible to get any item changed. If you get one price adjusted, they will overcharge you on a different section of the bill. The customer service representative who you initially speak with will promise anything to get you to sign up, then Comcast states that the charges are not part of the actual contract therefore, they can change them. I was told recently by customer service that the $79.00 was a limited offer discount, but that was the price I was quoted to sign up not a limited time special. When I called Customer Service (in the Philippines), I am told by the supervisor Al, ""We can always change the price whenever needed"". I signed a two year contract with the understanding that I was guaranteed the same price for two years. I might as well be speaking with a robot or a computer as someone in a call center who has no ability to assist me. If you are quoted one price to get you to signed the contract and you are charged another price- I believe it is called BAIT AND SWITCH which is a deceptive advertising practice, fraud, and it is a violation of consumer law. Comcast makes being a customer a painful, agonizing experience."
"Whitney of Plantation, FL","Oct. 6, 2015",1,"My service goes out every week. I work from home and this is causing a major issue for me. As usual I called Comcast today (10/5/15) about my internet outage. I was advised by the customer service agent that there was a outage in my area. I asked if that information can be sent to me through email. I was told ""NO"". Then I asked to speak with a manager. After being on hold for over a hour, I finally was able to speak with a manager. I explained my concerns and that I need this outage information for my employer, because this has been a ongoing issue and I need to provide an explanation to my employer. The manager put me on several holds and also advised me that she was not able to send me the needed information and that there was no outage in my area. During this whole time I still had no internet and neither issue was resolved. As I continued to explain the importance of my service and why I needed some type of documentation of the service outage the manager ID# ** disconnected the call. Immediately, after the manager hung up on me. I received 2 text messages from Comcast. The first one: ""The service outage in your neighborhood has been restored. Check your connection status anytime by logging in to https://customer.xfinity.com/m/commection/."" Then a second message: ""Your monthly bill is available to view online. Visit www.xfinity.com/myaccount to view and pay your bill. Reply STOP to stop text from Comcast Alerts (SM)."" WOW WOW WOW. I cannot get any internet service, I cannot get customer service assistance, but now my bill is due and oh they have increased my bill $10.

"Andreas of Tucson, AZ","Oct. 4, 2015",1,"Comcast in Tucson is charging a base fee for their internet and limit the use to 350GB. ONCE you go over, they charge you $10 for each additional 50GB. NOBODY knows where all that data is going and/or coming from but they just keep charging. Internet from Comcast in Tucson, Arizona is being treated as if it was gasoline. There are NO extra charges, no extra effort to Comcast or by its employees. No reason for the cap of 350GB. They just do it. Dare you stream or share anything. They don't want you to use your smart TV. Dare you. These people are pirates and scumbags. NEVER ever get Internet from these people."
"TIBERIU of Commerce Twp., MI","Oct. 4, 2015",1,"We switched to Comcast because of the better rates and performance they promised. Well, it's far away from AT&T that we had before. And for the price, the TV options are so poor. We would switch yesterday for another supplier. We don't even get FOX + for the money we pay. At least be honest COMCAST and say all your promises are LIES! Unfortunately, we don't have too many options in choosing the providers in this area. So we are stuck with this nightmare for a while. We would NEVER RECOMMEND COMCAST for any kind of service!!!"
"Carlos of Philadelphia, PA","Oct. 1, 2015",1,Another rip-off move from Comcast/Xfinity now charging customer data service in blocks. This company should be sue by the government for rip-off business practices. Always squeezing customers wallets. Rip-off company.
"Victoria of Riva , MD","Sept. 30, 2015",1,First of all everyone should double check their bill. I can't even get refunded through customer service who is trying to charge me for an extra month after I canceled service. I'm thinking I'm going to need to take this Mickey mouse operation to court.
"Cynthia of Royal Palm Beach , FL","Sept. 30, 2015",1,"Enough is enough. Waiting for a digital box to be sent to use and 2 weeks of Comcast rescheduling service calls that they never showed up for, I finally canceled Comcast went to AT&T U-Verse. I had problems with my cable TV and internet was very slow. Every time I called they sent out a signal, it did not work also. Scheduled appointments between no shows, not being able to watch TV, or able to stay on internet. We had enough, I canceled Comcast on 09/09/2015 after 15 years of business. (AT&T found the problem right a way. The squirrels ate into cable.)"
"Tony of Snellville, GA","Sept. 30, 2015",5,"I am writing about Comcast for unfair business practices due to the fact that when I moved into my house in April of 2003 I had AT&T service but as time progresses AT&T said they no more cover my area where my house is situated and that I had to go with Comcast. So I started my service with Comcast and when they started going up every time I opened my bill, I decided to try to go with the competitor AT&T because their charges is cheaper. But to my amazement they told me that only Comcast cover my area and my Comcast bill for a basic phone service for my alarm system and internet service has suddenly gone up to $133.75 a month which is almost double of what AT&T would have been charging me. But they said there is nothing that could be done. I was so disappointed that this kind of practice can happen in an open market economy like America, but I'm subjected to my faith of continuing to pay the unfair exorbitant bills because there's nothing I can do."
"Mary of Branford, CT","Sept. 29, 2015",1,"After about one hour of being transferred and disconnected, repeating same information about 8-10 times to live individuals and robotic voices I was able to get a service appointment to try and correct a chronic problem with inadequate wireless service in 1/2 of our home. We are paying for full service and only getting half. The company seems to have no problem wasting their customers time, they are not able to provide a fluid ""connection"" to the appropriate resource."
"katie of Tuscaloosa, AL","Sept. 29, 2015",1,I would never recommend XFINITY to anyone. I am literally paying for nothing. I can never use my wifi and every time I call I cannot even understand the person I am speaking with after I finally get off the phone with the automated messenger for 25 minutes. They are useless and are overpriced. I tried to call and cancel my account but they wouldn't let me over the phone.
"Margaret of North Lauderdale, FL","Sept. 28, 2015",1,"Comcast originally called me to state ""they were updating their equipment."" I needed to switch out my modem. They would mail it to me & I had to install it. I told them that I paid for my computer to be set up & I was not a tech, they should come out to switch out the modem. Comcast said they would charge me & so I refuse to have anything done. Next thing I know my internet is down & landline phone is down. I call & they tell me I need a new modem. I told them they need to install the modem without a charge. Comcast Rep say okay but would charge me only $20.00 for the installation but the Tech Visit. above my normal bill. I agreed & we set up an appointment for Saturday 9/16/15 from 8-10 am. I go to work & pick up my emails and find they sent me a bill for tech visit $39.95 plus the $20.00 installation. I called & spoke to another Rep, she makes an excuse that it is automatically generates a bill. She took off the $39.95. Saturday Tech never shows. I call & they tell me they cannot get in the gate but they never called me. I waited all day. I had given them my code to the gate so all they had to punch it in and it would ring to my cell since my landline phone was down. So they set another day up 9/26/15 Saturday & the time was 5-7 PM. Another no show. I wasted another Saturday waiting. And again they claimed they could not get in the gate. They had my cell number and gate code. I got my bill for September, called asked them to pro-rate the bill since I have no internet and no phone for two weeks. They said no, paid the whole bill and we will credit next month. I paid the bill. I tried calling corporate, left message for supervisors etc. but have had no help all. I call my landline phone and all it say that owner is not receiving incoming calls. Comcast does not care for their customers. All they want is their money. Buyer Beware!"
"Rami of Tinley Park, IL","Sept. 28, 2015",1,"The worst service ever. Slow... slow... slow! You pay for high speed internet as they claim (75) mgs per second and the actual internet speed is 6 mps. Unprofessional techs, from installers to customer support. They are all just like their company. Garbage."
"T of Arnold, MD","Sept. 28, 2015",1,"I cancelled my account with them on 8/22/15 due to their incompetence. Was told I would receive my final bill soon, which I did. The final bill was due by 9/23/15; no problem, I actually paid it in full on 9/25/15. I received a letter from a collection agency dated 9/17/15 that I needed to pay immediately for they now were handling my account/case, mind you this letter reached me on 9/26/15, yet dated 9/17. Idiots.Complete lack of common sense and customer service in regards to all their employees not to mention you cannot send a person to collections if they have not missed their due date! I would have given them a negative ""star"" if able to. I hope people realize sooner than later to go with other companies or simply ""unplug"". Needless to say I nor anyone I speak with will ever be their customer again, for I have yet to speak with someone who actually has something positive to say on their behalf. Good riddance."
"Pam of Fresno, CA","Sept. 28, 2015",1,"Similar to other reviews on this site, Comcast Xfinity offered my husband a great introductory price for one year of internet service. Yet, they never charged that price. The first month, they overcharged more than double. When he complained about the overcharge and mentioned the introductory offer, they said ""that's only for new customers."" He explained he was a new customer and they said since he had an account, he wasn't. He argued and got the rep to agree to adjust the price. Repeat the above for the next FOUR months. Every single month a different ""customer service"" rep said they would adjust the charge and the plan on record but they never did. On top of that there is no way to email the company. In fact one customer service rep said they are not allowed to email customers. I guess they don't want to leave a paper trail... all conversations over the phone leaves deniability over what was said. I am convinced that this is their business model. Quote one price and then charge another until the customer gives up and pays it or goes elsewhere (which is not an option for some areas of the country). I would leave NEGATIVE stars if I could."
"Nina of Ann Arbor, MI","Sept. 28, 2015",1,"After dark on a Sunday night, a repairman starting working on my house. I was frightened because I didn't know this guy was outside my house. When I asked him to step away from the house, he refused to identify himself or move away from the house. When I called to complain, the only people who would talk to me were in the Philippines. I hate Comcast. I am cancelling every contract I have."
"Matthew of Arlington, VA","Sept. 27, 2015",1,"I have two options for Wi-Fi in my current location: Verizon and XFINITY (Comcast). My experience with Verizon is that they make their money by perpetually screwing up my billing. After doing this THREE times in a row, I am changing my cell phone service and avoided them for wireless internet service for my new address. That brings me to Comcast's XFINITY. I happily called them, and after waiting a week (due to technician availability), I scheduled an appointment for the tech to visit my apartment and set up the cable, internet, and relevant equipment. Well, after barely 24 hrs., I'm back at STARBUCKS writing this review. Apparently the equipment Comcast uses has OCD rendering it in a state of ""perpetual reset."" It does NOTHING but reset itself. NOTHING. While Verizon perpetually screws up my billing (tho' not for long), Comcast bills me for NOTHING. Great business plan, guys. You all SUCK. I wish I could have a job where I could make money by screwing up everything AND providing nothing in return."
"Sherzod of Pittsburgh , PA","Sept. 26, 2015",1,"They charged me EFT return fee. They cannot explain the reason. All they say is, ""Call your bank."" My bank said there was not any charge from Comcast. I called 5-6 agents. They all said they can't see why there is a charge. I wasted 2-3 hours of my time."
"darrion of Dutch Flat, CA","Sept. 25, 2015",2,"About 3 weeks ago I switched my basic internet service with Comcast to a Bundle since it was actually cheaper at the time. $59.99 for Performance Internet (50Mbps)/HBO/Basic Cable for 12 months. I confirmed multiple times over the phone with the agent and thought everything was good. Today I called in to check on my current balance since the online system does not update for several weeks (apparently once a billing cycle). I was shocked when my balance was over a $100. The agent told me she did not know of any such package at the price point I was promised, but my account did show full pricing for the internet, some ""HD Tech"" add-on I didn't ask for, and the cable. So they were able to pile on all the services but not successfully bill me the right amount. Go figure. Fortunately, I called in and after some difficulty was able to get most of the charges removed (we will see, I have been promised things from Comcast before). I switched back to my prior internet-only service with them. Why doesn't Comcast email a receipt for the service change? Are they afraid that something in print could be damaging to their image? They keep everything secret on their end - you have to call in constantly to make sure things are being handled properly, otherwise things just magically slip up. It's an antiquated system from an antiquated company. I just hope the near-future will offer some alternatives for ISPs (Comcast has a monopoly in my area)."
"Nelson of Marietta, GA","Sept. 25, 2015",1,"I am sadly upset with lie after lie from Customer Services Agents and Supervisors. On September 20, I spoke with a female agent, who offered me a package of internet service plus Latino TV for $ 34.99 (no signed contract), and she stated that this amount will be kept for 24 months. I was driving and could not finish my deal with that female agent.On September 21, about 1:00 PM, I spoke with a male agent, who again offered me a 24 months no contract 3 GB internet service plus 119 Latino TV, plus many English Channels, including all Nickelodeon, all Disney Channels, Food Network and GSN (Games Show Network) Channel plus 2 HD boxes for $ 34.99 with an special technician, who will come to my house to install everything for extra $ 5.00 dollars. The male agent scheduled me for a technician visit for September 23, and said that the technician will bring the 2 HD boxes, and then he complimented: ""on September 22, you will receive a phone call from the technician to inform you what time on September 23 he or she will be there.""Last night (September 22) after no phone call received from the technician, I called Comcast Customer Service, and spoke with a Supervisor, who apologized about the 2 agents lies, since Comcast has not 24 months agreement with no one. Also, he informed me that no appointment was made, no 2 HD boxes were added, no special channels; but he said that he will be add the extra box (since the liar male (and female too) agents offered 2 HD boxes), and also he made the appointment for today September 23, between 1:00 to 3:00 PM.Today at 2:45 PM, I called Comcast Customer Service, and a female agent said, that the technician will be in my home about 3:20 PM. I called again at 4 PM, and spoke with an agent named Luis, who asked for my phone number since his supervisor will call me immediately. It is 5:00 PM, and no technician showed up, no agents and/or supervisors answer my phone calls, and I am in the limbo, since I disconnected my Dish TV service, expecting to have Comcast TV Service at 3:00 PM.It is very suspicious, that 2 agents, in two different occasions in two different days offered me a 24 months package, if Comcast never had that kind of agreement. I believe that those two poor liars agents, among others, had been trained by Comcast's Supervisor to sell those kind of lies to clients. And now, no technician, no agent, no supervisor, no Comcast TV, no Dish TV, and nobody is responsible for inefficiencies/ineptitudes /inadequacies within the soul of Comcast.Finally Comcast technician came at 6 PM, disconnected my internet services, used all previous Dish TV cables, asked me to move and remove furniture from 2 bedrooms and clothes from a closet, unrolled white and black co-axial cables inside and outside of the house, and suddenly I saw him packing his tools, without saying a word. When he was in his truck, I asked him: ""Are you leaving and have not internet and not TV?"" He got out of his car, and connected my internet, and then said: ""Tomorrow, I will be back or a new technician for TV purposes"", and left, leaving on the floor, bunches of connected cables to TV.Comcast agents and supervisors, just ""apologized again, as usual"", and nothing was resolved. Next day, September 24, no one from Comcast appeared, called, and no TV and one's responsibility. I am elevating my voice protesting with this Comcast's disorganizations and bundle of poor thing liars agents and (and do not know what to say about the Supervisors, who supposedly to be the example for those low IQ liars agents), and incompetent unrespectable, unconscious technicians (but to expect of this miserable company?) Expecting that this cause some shaking and roll heads of the Comcast's handful agents and Supervisors, who maintain Comcast's ineffectiveness, and are direct responsible of those."
"Pranav of Chicago, IL","Sept. 25, 2015",1,"I opened an account on the 9th September and my account got disconnected without my permissions on 21st September. After over 10 hours on the call and chat, nobody could figure out what happened and I was told the account is dead. So finally the resolution was that I open a new account which I did as of 24th September. I called later in that night to activate my modem, which I own, and they activated the service. When I wake up today I see that they activated the service on the account which was apparently disconnected on error. Now I have 2 accounts at the same location with the service I don't want.Cancelling an account without my consent was breach in my privacy. Also, Xfinity/Comcast made a hard credit check without my consent which is another major breach of my privacy. Every time I talk to an agent they give some new info. If nothing happens soon, I will be forced to sue Comcast for mental harassment."
"L of Humble, TX","Sept. 24, 2015",1,"I have been leaving resumes/filling out applications daily where I could find employment. It's been over 5 months already, stressful - but trying to keep a positive outlook. Suddenly my e-mail thru Comcast stops working. I start off following directions to ""get new password"". The entire online system takes me thru ""loops"" back to the beginning 3 times, frustrating. So I have to phone them, the answering system, places me in 2 different loops on two different subject matters due to the fact I was trying to get the correct department. When I finally get the correct department, and I explain to the technician what happened concerning the phone loops. He goes into of an explanation of ""how the phone system works..."" (but it doesn't work that way, maybe as a customer they should try it, so they can find out what the customer is dealing with). I continue my contact Comcast; the technician stated, they disconnected my e-mail due to me not having service. But I did have service and it was in good standing. I had no warning, all my resume/job connections via my e-mail were gone. I entered slight panic mode, I felt I was violated. Something that was mine, taken. I do pay for service monthly phone and internet to Comcast for a few years now. They said it would take 3-7 days to fix. The technician stated very emphatically ""it was the customers fault it happened."" ""Excuse me? How is that?"" ""Well the last person who had that e-mail address canceled the account."" ""No, he got married to me, moved in, and I had Comcast/Xfinity, what is the problem."" ""See I told you, it was customer's fault.""So we have been using this e-mail address on nearly everything we had for over 2 years. They disconnected it with no notice, no empathetic apology, just pointing at us. So all I could do was wait. 3 days later I call again (same loop with the phone system). This time the salesperson said, he didn't see an explanation of any previous phone calls on my account. When I then explained to him what happened, he very calmly said (without any typing) ""Oh, they are working on resolving the issue."" I hesitated and asked, ""how can you say they are resolving it, when you just said you didn't see anything on my account?"" Slight sarcasm, ""Well ma'am, I see it now,"" then a firmer comment as he was frustrated with me, ""They are resolving the issue."" At this point I had my doubts, so I asked, ""do they have a solution in which they are working on? Or will I get this same comment 6 months from now? Working on it could take 6 months?"" ""Ma'am, they are working on a resolution, that's all I can say."" Once again with sarcasm. Disregardful of a human being on the other side of an e-mail address (despite the fact I was a paying customer). Loops online. Loops on answering system. Accusatory to a customer, not really best practice for a loyal paying customer. They actually went up $15 on my bill for the next months service (not due to late fees etc), just went up.When looking for a job, all need e-mail accounts and passwords on job sites, and many on applications which need to be verified/confirmed thru the e-mail account. This put my job searching to a halt, and if anyone contacted me thru e-mail for a job will probably figure I blew them off. Thank you Comcast. While I was updating passwords etc, and feeling the same frustrations speaking with operators and different places of business, none of them made me feel as insignificant as Comcast. Some were quite pleasant and gave me a hope for humanity again. I contacted other internet providers. Oh so many. They are none which service in my area, other than Xfinity. I figure I have no choice. Then again, I do. No internet or phone service for me. Thank you."
"Frederick of Sunrise, FL","Sept. 23, 2015",1,"Service was interrupted on September 20, 2015 at 5:30 PM. We opted for the bundled service. As a result no landline service either. Had it not been for AT&T (cell and tablet) service we would be toast. Comcast could not get a technician out until September 23. My issue is an isolated one, my neighbors don't have this particular issue. For a company that prides itself on superior service it appears amplifiers are prone to lightning strikes."
"Nabil of Jacksonville, FL","Sept. 22, 2015",1,"I don't know from where to begin, but briefly I advice all users not to deal with Xfinity - Comcast Internet provider if you wish to save your time, nerves, health and money... It is the worst I have ever dealt with and the worst service - internet not stable, it fluctuate, the Billing is ALWAYS ALWAYS HIGHER THAN IT SHOULD. They seem to be helpful and supportive but in fact it's nothing but a cheat just to so called, offer support that does not solve any issue. I came to the point that I would even stay without internet just for the sake of not using what they call internet service. I recommend everyone not to use XFINITY- COMCAST!! IT IS JUST SO DISAPPOINTING."
"Beverly of Memphis, TN","Sept. 22, 2015",1,"Recently, once again my internet service was out. This happens regularly about every 3-4 weeks. I spend hours on the phone with their tech department only to have them 'schedule an appointment' for a repairman who sometimes show up and sometimes doesn't. If during the conversation you happen to get disconnected, which also happens regularly, they do not call back so we, the customers, have to call again and go through their long process a second time, doubling the time you are on the phone. Well, today after getting a bill that increased another $10, I called to reduce my plan so I could afford to watch TV. It is strange to me that a company that cannot keep their internet service working can IMMEDIATELY drop your service... I mean in seconds! Just a thought!"
"Vinh of Katy, TX","Sept. 20, 2015",1,"For the past couple months, I have been contacting Comcast regarding my overpriced Internet bill. They can never seem to get my bill correct even after numerous confirmations that they have made the changes in their system. At the end of the month, I am charge with an insane amount and on top of that, they provided TV service/equipment (which was stated, ""Free of charge"") and billed me $50 fee extra on top of the incorrect internet quote. Looks like Comcast needs to train their employees better and take the time to invest in taking a step back and reviewing the numerous complaints that many others have expressed to know what it takes to provide customers with excellent service. I am happy to close my account and look elsewhere since a simple communication and problem can easily be resolve even by a 5 year old."
"Ira of Boca Raton, FL","Sept. 20, 2015",1,"We got Comcast internet services over a month ago and from the day we order till this day it has been a mess! At first the company confirmed a day of connection, they did not show up! Then the technician left the cable unburied in the back yard and said that in one week the workers would come to buried it - it has been over a month and they never showed up for that. What they did was to connect another cable and left the rest of the roll hanging on the wall for about three weeks now. They did not call to say that they were coming and much less what they would do. So we have two cables in the back yard, one hanging and other loose on the ground and we have called them many times and the work never got done! The customer services is one of the worse of entire world. If you are lucky you get someone on the phone located in US otherwise you will get someone in Philippines as I spoke with three so called ""supervisors"" from there and they did not do anything at all! :( The bill arrives super fast but the work to be completed is far to be fast! We are so very disappointed and went through so much aggravation in such a short period of time with this company already that we are looking to sign up with a better one! Comcast should closed their doors, they do not have structure to operate as a decent business and much less to have lots of customers so unhappy!"
"Stephen of Claymont, DE","Sept. 26, 2015",1,"I have been contacted by someone from their executive support dept. after talking with them, all that was able to be resolved was 50.00 credit and an offer to replace the modem / gateway to an older model and I would have to get my own router. This is basically all that can be done. Comcast does not consider this a real problem worth their time and expense.Original ReviewI just checked and of course, the Wi-Fi has been enabled again, just as I thought Comcast is purposely enabling the WIFI Hotspot after I log out of my account. I know this because I use a app called Wi-Fi Analyzer and it shows a Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspot broadcasting signal. The ID numbers are almost identical to mine (only the 2nd number is different - EX: Mine is E8 / Xfinity WIFI Hotspot is E6) to prove that it is my gateway broadcasting the signal, I unplugged the gateway and yes both signals disappeared and reappeared when I plugged it back in. This is clear proof that Comcast is purposely lying to me and all it's customers - letting them think they can shut down the Free WIFI Hotspot, knowing that it will be automatically turned on when they log out of their accounts. It's bad enough that I pay a high bill for my Internet, plus the fact that Comcast charges me a Gateway Rental Fee and you lie to your customers about this. I guess Comcast doesn't care that they leave their customers open to Hackers and ID thieves. Of course, they will claim it's totally safe, but any decent hacker can get around the firmware & software and hack a router/gateway. Nothing is fool proof."
"Joseph of Portland, OR","Sept. 18, 2015",1,"I just moved to Oregon and the ISP for some reason couldn't install the internet connection for 2 weeks... Even with the ""We'll put you on the appointment cancelation list"", assurance. So I noticed that the WIFI signal for XFINITY- WIFI was open and more importantly strong signal, so I connected and they gave the option to try for an hour and to purchase access. During that hour, with this connection, I was able to stream the NFL game and while not perfect... minor buffering issues, it provided that level of bandwidth. As soon as I purchased the service it became terrible. Literally just surfing the web was so painfully slow that it wasn't even functional. I can't stream an internet radio station because it holds a continuous ""buffering"" screen. I believe that this is the classic ""Bait and switch"""
"Kirsten of Naples, FL","Sept. 16, 2015",1,"I just moved into my new home and contacted Comcast for internet and TV. Outdated equipment was delivered via mail - no install offered. Needed to hire video/audio tech at my expense. Buzz (very fast internet service) 0 - none existence. Internet is most of the time down. Spent about 3-4 hours with Comcast every day to fix problem. Special offer of $49 a month turned into a premium account for $99 a month with monthly billing of $249.00 for no service! Executive team all by the name Brianna, Rianna, Kesha., sounds familiar (I think they watch too much music videos), apologize bla bla bla bla but don't accomplish anything."
"Terry of Shirley , MA","Sept. 15, 2015",1,"They promise 100 m download for their blast service. My computer NEVER got over 72 and during peak hours it dwindled down to 15 m on the speed test. They had 101 excuses for this including blaming my laptop. No credit given for service I was not getting. They do a transfer of service and move my billing cycle 2 weeks earlier. This caused a $100.00 discrepancy in my normal monthly bill. Tried to explain what happened but they cannot do simple math and justified my bill as accurate even though I was getting ripped off for 2 weeks of service for them changing the billing cycle and them charging a month in advance. FIOS is not in my area but wish it was. My mother has FIOS and it is 100X better than Comcast with 100X better customer service. Don't be another Comcast victim, get FIOS if all possible."
"Michael of Smyrna, TN","Sept. 13, 2015",1,"We recently terminated our contract with AT&T because their offered internet speeds were just too slow for as many devices as we had, with at least one person in the house always watching Netflix most of the day, and two gamers in the house. Comcast is currently the only high-speed bandwidth provider in my area, with Google Fiber soon on the horizon. So I signed up for the 25 mb/s speeds to start with. There was no term contract, which was good, because as soon as Google Fiber rolled through my area I was going to drop Comcast in a heartbeat and switch over.About three months in, I've had zero issues so far. I received a call from a Comcast rep telling me about this great new deal they had. 75Mb/s download speeds for only 20$ more per month. Sounded great, still no contract, so I agreed. I was actually getting well over these speeds by using my own equipment (A router and modem that I had purchased), so I was fairly satisfied. Until yesterday. I received an email from Comcast telling me I had reached 90% of my 300gb/s bandwidth limit, and it was only the 13th. I have never received this mail before, so I went to the website to check. It actually took a good while to find the usage meter hidden away off to the side of the screen, and not on a page that you would expect it. Something like this you would think would be right on the front page of the My Xfinity page, or in at least the overview.What angers me is at no point did the rep mention this to me over the phone. It was not in my plan before, as we've binged watched countless hours of Netflix shows. And now, all of their plans have changed suddenly, all but the 300$ a month internet packages have this nonsensical data cap, I found when going to downgrade to my previous internet speeds. And the 'Unlimited data option' that they mention in the FAQ? Not available for my area. There was no warning that they would be imposing this cap, the customer service rep on the phone seemed to have glossed over it, and no reasonable way to get around it. I am highly dissatisfied with my services, and their sneaky hidden agreements and charges. I wouldn't even recommend Xfinity to my worst enemies."
"Jeffrey of Inkster, MI","Sept. 12, 2015",1,"I called on 9/1 to set up service and they told me they needed to call me back. Never did. I called them on 9/4 and they gave me an address to go to a Comcast center to set up my account. I followed the address To Plymouth MI but the address was invalid and took me to an abandoned building. I called customer service and they said they would return my call with the correct address. Never called. I waited for their call but called them back a few days later and they sent me to another store in Dearborn MI on 9/10. This office actually existed. I went in and set up the account and was given a certain modem to buy at Best Buy. I went and bought the ""zoom"" modem they suggested. After waiting on the phone for over 2 hours I was finally directed to someone in the Philippines who hardly speaks English but told me that the modem I had bought was incorrect. I went and bought another modem they suggested and that one was Comcast approved. She gave me a callback number to call her when, in her words, ""the light no more flashy"". The light continued to be ""flashy"" and when I called the direct line number she gave me back it was disconnected. I eventually was able to reach someone who spoke English to schedule an appointment for a technician to come out to my house. But because they were Philippines they tried to schedule an appointment for me on my yesterday. But after helping them understand that I don't live in their time zone she scheduled an appointment for 9/12 between 2:30 & 4:30. The technician never showed. After spending an hour waiting for customer service to pick up the employee didn't apologize for any inconvenience but rather let me know that I will be charged for the past two weeks of not having internet even though I have had no service in the slightest. He let me know that the only time someone is available to come out and turn on my internet service I've been paying for is next week. Even with this review their website has refreshed causing me to rewrite my complaint. I've lost a good 20 hours of my life working with Comcast. I will be pulling my services tonight unless they give me a a credited 2 weeks of my life back... if I can even get through to anyone. I have had service with multiple other companies over the years and they have all give me access to Internet within 3-4 days TOP. Never 2 weeks with an insane amount of follow up on my end."
"Jean of Wellington , FL","Sept. 12, 2015",1,"Where do I begin... (they deserve 0 stars) Here's my story: I placed my order and was told I'd receive it by Sept 3rd. That didn't happen, I contacted online chat to find that my order was cancelled. Why? Nobody knows. My inquiry was escalated to a new person who said she was looking into it and then closed the session without speaking to me. I called the customer service number (laughable) to see what was going on. I was sent to 3 people after the usual 30 min wait on hold... Nobody knew why my order was cancelled so it was reordered for a Saturday delivery 9/5.On Friday, I get a call from this ""phone number"" 261-450 and left a message that my account needs to be validated. But she didn't say what company she was from, I had no way to redial the number as it doesn't exist. She didn't leave her name either. I only knew who it was because I recognized her voice. Once again I called... And waited... I spoke to a rep who told me that Saturday delivery was not possible and that she gave me wrong info. He set it up for rush delivery (Labor Day weekend) but I wouldn't get it until Tuesday.Tuesday came and no order, I called. My stuff was supposed to arrive Wed but they couldn't tell me for sure. Ugh!!! Wed came and finally so did my stuff. After setting up my equipment and it didn't work - what a shock right? - I had to find a number to call because their instructions to ""activate"" the account only include a web address (ummmm I'm setting up my internet right?) If I don't have an android or an iPhone, I simply cannot activate my account. Sooooooo I went online - (yes whew I have an iPhone) to find a phone number which I did. Mind you this is the number specifically for activating the account.After validating who I was, the only option I was directed to was this - ""your account balance is zero.. To set up payment, please press 1""... Omg I wasn't asking for my balance! I hung up and tried again. Same thing. This time I kept pressing zero in the hopes of getting an operator. After allllll of that, I'm told that I need to call back during normal business hours. So I found a new number to call the next day... The extremely under enthused rep was walking me thru install and said... Hold on please... He send me to tech support with no warning. The tech rep is trying to find out why my internet was not online. Then he asks the magical question, ""Did anyone come to your home to set up the service to your apartment?"" Grrrrrrr no!!They were supposed to set that up the day that my order was placed. They tried to set me up for an appointment 8 days later. I said absolutely not. I am not willing to wait. I explained that after all of these phone calls and errors and waiting, if someone wasn't there that day, my account is closing. What next? They put me through to retention.This supervisor promised a call back within 1/2 hour. I did get a call about 2 hours later saying that someone would be at my home on the 11th and I didn't have to be home. On the eve of the 11th, I called again. Surely there was a tech here that did the job and simply didn't notify me. I attempted to set up the equipment. Nope! Not working. This rep told me that he would find out what happened and call me back. Did he call me? Nope.So I called someone else to cancel my order. An extremely condescending person named Mark told me that he would speak to me if I was so angry. Really? I enlightened him with reasoning. Especially that I told him that I wasn't directing my frustration at him. Moving on, he apologized about the service and said that he's never seen a rush service not be completed as it was escalated to urgent status. He said that it would be completed today the 12th. And I would hear back by 10 am.By 12:30 I called customer service AGAIN! After reviewing my entire situation yet again, the rep told me she would get a manager to call me back as I told her that I must have someone call me immediately. 2 hours later, I missed her call from another non existing number. She told me to call her back at her number. I called. This was the message ""you've reached this number at non business hours, please call back"". Needless to say, I haven't heard from her. I called customer service yet again. I demanded my account be closed. Mind you that they won't tell you that they tell you that they'll see what they can do and promise a call back that doesn't come. This new rep told me that I'm scheduled for service on the 19th! I adamantly refused and demanded a manager. After waiting 10 minutes, she came back on to tell me that she'll connect me to a manager now... NO. I was sent back to customer service.My blood was boiling. In the meantime, I received a call from my buddy Mark. You know, the one who told me that I would get a call by 10 am and that today work would be done. He now told me that I'm set up for the 19th. Needless to say I was furious!!! He was excruciatingly rude, condescending... And he hung up on me. I returned my stuff to the store. I was told it would be a 60 minute wait. I said absolutely not and demanded a manager. ""Pam"" came over and told me that I can leave my stuff there but no receipt. I said there's no way that I'm leaving my stuff with no receipt. She told me that she can't give me one. I was calling the police. Which I would never do normally ever but this was just insanity and waiting another hour was not happening. A very rude rep came over and to me basically ""too bad, if you don't want to wait, return it to UPS"".I headed right over to XFINITY and returned my stuff. I put my foot down and to Pam the supervisor that I'm not leaving without a receipt for my returned equipment which she refused to give me twice. I told her that I'm calling the police (which I'm not the type to do but this was all just too much). Finally, she agreed and gave me a receipt. Ps- the 4 people that came in after me were just as angry as I was. They also had serious complaints and zero tolerance when they were all told to wait an hour. What are the odds that in a 10 minute span, of the 5 customers that came in, all of us were furious at the non service received. Stay away from XFINITY / Comcast! Terrible terrible terrible!"
"John of Santa Fe, NM","Sept. 12, 2015",1,"Every time you call Comcast you have to suffer through minutes of pushing buttons, no one is ever available with whom to speak. You get run through the mill with advertisements and requests to spend even more than you are currently charging for monthly services. When you get someone on the telephone most staff is out of country and frequently cannot communicate unless they read pages of information printed in front of them. Frequently, you are transferred to a second individual and often the phone connection is disconnected. Thus, one has to start all over with listening to the worse automated information doing nothing but constantly aggravating you. I believe it is your subconscious goal to aggravate all of your customers since you have such a monopoly. Any other corporation has to be better than you. Scale of 1 to 10, you rank with everyone who has you in a minus category lower than one."
"Kimyona of Lithonia, GA","Sept. 11, 2015",1,"I am an existing Comcast customer. Upon signing up for this company cable & internet services on 6/25/15 to waiting approximately 7/26/15 to have my service installed & connected I received my first bill of the amount $349.22 on 8/15/15. After making numerous attempts of having an negotiable agreement was not met on my behalf as a loyal customer, I was spoken with in a rudeness manner while having the phone hung up on me while making my complaints several times."
"Minerva of Jacksonville, FL","Sept. 11, 2015",1,"The worst. THE WORST. I could tell you of a dozen times I spent 3+ hours on the phone just to report an outage. This last one round of phone wars went TEN HOURS, because everyone wanted to argue that I wasn't experiencing the outage that I was indeed experiencing. I tried to cancel service and they phone tagged me around for another FOUR hours. Do they think this time isn't valuable to us? I harassed AT&T until they finally agreed to put a line down our street. I gave up on trying to reach someone on the phone and took my router in and had my service disconnected. The guy at the store said my router, that was given to me by Comcast only a year ago, was super outdated and my internet was going at about half the speed. He said I should have been sent a different one two years ago. He also said my plan was grossly overpriced and they had newer, cheaper plans. WAY TO NAIL THAT COFFIN SHUT."
"JERYL of Savannah, GA","Sept. 11, 2015",1,"I have been on the phone with various Comcast Reps from Customer Solutions Department to resolve the so call promotion end that wasn't indicated on the bill. They all have given me different dates of when and what notes they can review notes, but since I know this to be a problem I give them the dates from my notes. Their consistency that our promotion ran out without a reminder is not a good business practice. I am emailing the CEO of Comcast and I demand to be treated fairly. They should have no right to adjust anyone's bill without notifying the customer. We went from paying $57 a month to $130-140 and then their explanation program expired, but no restitution for the 3 times reps have came out to figure out why our speed is so low and constantly buffers. The rep. then said ""you have the fastest internet we have."" What A JOKE! It buffers to load a video. Comcast Xfinity is the worse provider and someone needs to come into Savannah and show them that quality over quantity is what consumers want. On hold with Daisy for almost an hour. Loretta (Customer Relations) and Latoyah (Customer Relations) happened to disconnect me without calling back after altogether 3 or more hours. Restating the same thing over and over. Company is full of excuses and lies!"
"linda of Bloomfield , CT","Sept. 9, 2015",1,"It is really so disheartening to know that your company can get away with this type of service and not have to have any accountability. I am expecting that you pull every last one of the calls that I have made today to hear each and every conversation with the 8 various people that we spoke with. How would you feel if you were sitting in a house that was 92 degrees? I found out a very good lesson today: You do not value me, a customer. Make sure to listen to the call with your agent, Chris, that took place at approximately 8:39. He is a winner. He didn't care about my issue at all. Thanks for being such a bad company with the most awful customer service that I have ever encountered. Take note to let everyone that I spoke with know about the 3/15 rule -- If a person receives great customer service they will tell 3 people. If the service is bad they tell 15. I will be telling way more than 15. This complaint will be posted on Facebook, Twitter, and any complaint website that I can find. You have treated me like a used, worn-out rag that has been thrown to the side. Shame on you.I made an appointment yesterday with Comcast because my thermostat which was installed by Comcast stopped working yesterday, After getting a low battery light I proceeded to change the batteries. After doing so the thermostat would not light up. I called Comcast yesterday and after going through their troubleshooting the representative told me that she had scheduled an appointment with Comcast for 09/08/2015 and that they would be at my home between the hours of 9-11 a.m. My husband stayed home for the day after canceling all of his appointments. He is an accountant. At 8:30 a.m. a Comcast technician comes to my home and drops off a thermostat stating that an electrician would be by my home within the hour. At 1:00 p.m. my husband calls to inform me that the electrician never showed up and he had contacted Comcast who informed him that the call was noted as being resolved. He informed them that not only was it not resolved by on the hottest day of the year -- our home was a hot 91 degrees. He spoke with a woman by the name of Ashley. After speaking with my husband I too called Comcast and spoke with a gentleman by the name of Jonathan. I explained to him that my husband had been on the line with Ashley who stated that she had call a dispatch ticket in and stated that we should hear from someone within the hour. This was at 1:00 p.m. Since my husband had previously called Jonathan stated that we would hear from Comcast by 1:22 p.m. Of course that time came and went. I called Comcast back at 2:15 p.m. to advise that no one from Dispatch had contacted us. This time I spoke with Chris who stated that he was showing in his system that we were contacted and a electrician was en route to our home. Chris indicated again that Dispatch had advised us that they would be at our home. This was a flat out lie. No one from Comcast ever contacted our home. I called my husband to see if the electrician had arrived and he indicated he had not. I called Comcast yet again. By this time our home was a very hot 92 degrees. Side note: When the central air is controlled by a thermostat you have no cooling options. I spoke with a fourth person named Wally and demanded to speak with a supervisor because this was not acceptable. They stated they would be at my home to check on my thermostat. Between the hours of 9-11 a technician drops off a thermostat and advises that the electrician will be at my home within the hour of his drop-off time which was 8:30 a.m. So at the latest the electrician should have been here at 10:00 a.m. It is now 8:03 p.m. We are still waiting on an electrician after being told at 6:15 by a supervisor named Bree that someone would be here. Why is it that we can call Comcast 6 times, get six different answers, and still be in a home with no air and a room temperature of 92 degrees? When did it become ok to falsify documents and state that you would be fulfilling an obligation and then not have to do it? Oh and then the kicker, we are told that we do not have an appointment for today -- it is tomorrow. If all phone call documentation is pulled you will find in each call to Comcast we received different information. Not only did we receive different information but on the last call with Bree we were promised that an electrician would be at our home. Hmmmm, do you really think that someone will be at my home with the room temperature of 92 degrees at 8:06 p.m.? Please note that this is my formal complaint against this monopoly who obviously feels like my time is not of any importance. Not one phone call from them but trust me you will see that I phoned them 6 times. Really, what am I getting for my 375.00 plus dollars per month? What, you ask -- sub-par service that they should be ashamed of. This is the worst company in the entire world. How can they get away with lying to me for an entire day and still not showing up to install a thermostat that they dropped off at my home at 8:30 this morning? This is not the first time that they have failed to deliver. Tell them to pull all call logs from the numerous times we have called since January of this year. Shame on you Comcast. You are greedy and obviously not a company interested in customer satisfaction. While it is 8:50 p.m. called Comcast for an ETA on when the electrician would be here tonight and we were just told that the electrician would not be at our home as someone has closed the ticket out. Really, FCC, in what world is it ok to just close out an escalated ticket and not notify a customer that has been waiting all day for an electrician that was promised by Bree. She assured us that someone would be at our home tonight and now we are being told that it will not happen and we will have to stay in a house with our pet and children that is 92 degrees. I hope that you really take action against this company. If you can not resolve my issue this information will be posted on all complaint boards so that others know that no one really cares."
"Vic of Santa Cruz, CA","Sept. 9, 2015",1,"So I was without internet for 4 days before I was able to finally schedule a service call (they said there was a general outage in my area and once that was fixed my internet service would be restored as well. It was not hence the need for a service call). I scheduled to take time off work so I could be home for the technician. After waiting 2 hours he never showed up. I called Comcast and they said my appt. was cancelled. They never notified me it was cancelled. I was very mad. They said they would send a guy out to check the pole and verify service was available. This would occur between 8am and 8pm the next day. If there were any questions they would call me. Well I had taken the day off so I thought maybe there was a chance it would get fixed. Around 6 that night I call and say that I'm still without internet service. They told me they cancelled the pole guy.Huh. Why? ""Oh you have a problem with your router and need a new one since we cannot contact it"". This state of affairs had been verified several times already which I believe was the reason for the pole guy to begin with. So I go to the Comcast store and return my ""defective"" cable box. While I'm there I get a text saying I can save myself 10 a month by buying a cable box. So I run over to a chain and grab a router and register MAC address with Comcast. Still no internet. Call Comcast again. ""Oh you will need a technician. Let's schedule you an appt."" Well there were no slots available over the weekend so I schedule to take time off work again.I'm at home cleaning the carpet. I noticed a call. It is Comcast telling me the technician showed up but no one was home. Yes Comcast there were people there. So I get on the phone and demand they send him back. Twice they say they will call me back with an ETA. Both times they fail to call me back. I finally get a supervisor and he tells me they only work between 8 and 6 on weekdays. Well I'm not about to take more time off. So I schedule for the coming weekend. We will see if they show up, can fix the problem or if this is dragged out for a few more weeks.What strikes me about this encounter with Comcast is their 1st level employees are all reading from scripts. They just keep spouting the various scripts until you give up or do what they want. It really is like talking to machine that is responding to keywords to determine the script they will read from. When I compare this process to T-mobile's 1st level help, who I was talking with during the same time period since I needed to buy more data from them until Comcast fixed my internet service, it is just night and day. The T-mobile reps took action instead of trying to delay the need to make a commitment.The other thing that stood out about Comcast is just how unconcerned they are about customers. They canceled a schedule appt. without contacting me and then after I went ballistic they offered me $15. Which I think is what they owed me for the number of days at that point I was without internet service. They did not care that I lost a total of 5 hours of work time (two 2 hour appointments and needing to leave 30 minute early for each appt.) and they repeatedly ignored my request for compensation for the lost work time. If they had shown up I'd be OK with taking time off. But they just blew me off and that shows a real lack of respect towards their customers. My goal now is to find an alternative service. And convince everyone I know how much better that alternative is to Comcast."
"brant of Shoreview, MN","Sept. 8, 2015",1,"After a decade of non-stop issues with Comcast I finally decided to go with another company with a slower speed just to get away from them. The customer service has been a non-stop charade of rudeness and glaring ineptitude. There is a reason why there is an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to how bad a company this is. Each to their own, but you've been warned... Stay far away from Comcast!"
"Julie of Cumming, GA","Sept. 7, 2015",1,We have been X-finity Comcast customers for the last 10 years. We have a good package and average monthly bill $250 to $300. We have not had to deal with customer service the last 10 years. I have seen some bad reviews for company but not experienced it myself until now. The last two months we received a $650 and $860 bill. The data usage they are billing us is enormous. We have a Meraki wireless access point that tracks data usage and device usage. The discrepancy is enormous. The amount of data they are billing us for is 3000GB per month. We travel almost every weekend with kids sports and kids are in school during weekdays. I use internet below average and no streaming.My husband has called customer service 8-times in the last 6 weeks. The case has been open 6 weeks and they have not contacted us once. No phone call or email stating they are working on resolution or providing insight on usage. NOTHING! We just got text stating we are 110% over usage and only 7-days into cycle. We have only been home 4 days of the last 7. We decided last week to cancel service but even that is impossible. They transfer you or hang up on you. Not one person can answer your questions. The customer service department truly cannot help you. This is very bad customer service and not acceptable for a company that you pay thousands of dollars. We have lost faith in Comcast and wonder is they are fraudulently billing customers.
"Makoto of Bellevue, WA","Sept. 4, 2015",1,"Cable box malfunctioned (2 months of ""We'll send signal to correct it""). Returned the box at Factoria (Bellevue, WA) service center on Aug 3, 2015. My turn was skipped. When I complained, a staff told me that ""I called your name 3 times and you were not paying attention"" - not true. When I said (sorry to lose my temper, but...), ""that's **"", that staff tells me to ""Shut your mouth"". Called the manager to complain. Jacob ** never returned my 7 voicemails or 2 emails. Escalated the complaint to corporate (""executive escalation""). ** calls on Aug 24, with excuses that his phone has been malfunctioning for 2 months (hmm, corporate sure got through) and he did reply to my emails - hmm, nope. Both corporate and ** promises credits. But, have not seen any on my statements. Apologies from staff and management were promised, but none received. In the meantime, I was billed for a DVR service which I have never had. Called to have the bill corrected, and the call center in India removes that DVR and my HD signal. No TV service for 4 days. (Finally corrected by in-house tech service). Yes, I may get some credit, but no evidence thus far."
"Sylvia of Milton, GA","Sept. 3, 2015",1,"I was on the phone with Comcast to cancel my internet service and the agent offered me another package that was bundled with HBO. The price offered on the phone was $44.99. After I got my bill, the price went to $49.99 before tax. When I received the bill, the price was $49.99 and after talking to them over the phone, no one took the blame and I am stuck with $49.99. Clearly the agents at Comcast are not train to help the customers but themselves.After I got the TV box and tried to activate the cable TV, it was not working. We called Comcast 4 times to fix the issue and they agreed to send someone to help us. But without advising us in advance, we were being charged $39.95 for the service that was supposed to be done over the phone. No agents could help us on the phone to activate the TV and we were supposed to pay for their lacking in knowledge? Very frustrating experience!"
"Guy of Saugus , MA","Sept. 3, 2015",1,"I have been calling Comcast out to my house for almost a year now. They have been out over 6 times. I was told to upgrade for the 50 Mbps and lucky at some points getting about 10. Now since last time a month ago they replaced the modem again and now only getting to 2 Mbps. Now they said I have been paying for 50 Mbps but not having the codes setup for it. Working with them to get fix again and trying to get some sort of credit. Each time I ask for a credit it's amazing how in the peak of the day when I call their sales system is down. But, when call them back to ask to add a package to my account that is working..."
"Russ of Berkeley Lake, GA","Sept. 3, 2015",1,"Comcast, THE WORST! Installer left without system up. NO internet, NO cable, NO phone. ALL DAY to get customer no service to help and get tech back to my house. NO apology, NO help! Fast Internet Speed, not true."
"jennifer of Hobe Sound, FL","Sept. 2, 2015",1,"I am a business owner and strive very hard to get back positive reviews. However, this company here in Florida should not even be allowed to operate. My experience has been a fraction of what others have encountered but I cannot in good conscience keep silent. I hate calling customer service to be hung up on or be kept on hold for 20 mins. Unreal!!! What is so difficult? Send out your technician!!! Just Horrible!!! They don't deserve even 1 star!!!"
"Astra of Westminster, CO","Sept. 2, 2015",1,I was a previous customer of Comcast about 5-6 years ago. In May of 2015 I contacted Comcast to inquire about internet service. I spoke via chat to a salesperson to get information. I never completed any order. I never activated any service. But on 09/01/15 I received a bill for 169.00. I contacted Comcast and they said I had to file a fraud complaint and police report because someone was fraudulently using my information. I had recently pulled a credit report and had no other unusual activity on my credit report. I believe the salesperson opened this account with my prior information. I have four email from Comcast that show I never completed any order. However I have to do all this work of filing these reports when Comcast most likely knows this was an inside job.
"W of Lovejoy , GA","Sept. 1, 2015",1,I had internet and home security installed a few months ago. I was not told that I had a data limit. When I discovered I had a limit I was told I could check my usage online. This was false. I cannot get anything but an error message telling me my equipment cannot be loaded. I tried 3 times to get help. The last time I was told I would have to call for my data usage. After I got finished speaking to tech support my home alarm started going off. Xfinity says it is not going off. I can only assume I am being punished for having an issue. I would not suggest Xfinity Home or Comcast internet to anyone. The customer support is an overseas call center that bounces you from one person to the next and they never solve the problem. I am now stuck in a 2 year contract with internet I can't use for fear of incurring fees and a home alarm that keeps going off.
"Florence of Berkeley, CA","Sept. 1, 2015",1,"More than I year ago I experienced slow internet service (slow page load). A Comcast service rep recommended an upgrade to the modem box and unneeded upgrade to Extreme 150 internet service for an additional $50/month. After accepting the service, and more than one year later I learned that the Extreme 150 was no benefit for regular Mac users that do not do gaming or streaming services. The Mac speed is less than 70 cannot handle the 150 extreme services for routine internet browsing, emails, and downloading documents. Be smart and don't be misled by the Comcast Service Reps!"
"Joni B. of Parkland, FL","Sept. 1, 2015",1,"We have been stuck in the phone wheel of death for 2-3 hours on three occasions in last three months trying to get resolution. They send people out who then have no idea what they are doing. They get on phone with supervisors, look for direction, spend hours in my home wasting our time then tell me someone will call me the next day to reschedule. On the last and fourth such visit, we were scheduled to have the whole house rewired as we get 3-5 mbs and pay for 100! Supervisor Alex comes out then tells me they were not scheduled for rewiring, we were scheduled for troubleshooting. I lose it of course and after 1 hour on phone with numerous people, he says they will have to reschedule. Says he will not leave the property until it is resolved and rescheduled. I leave and go to work as he is to call my cell phone. He never calls and of course leaves. I am left back at square one. I am at my wits end. I have a house full of teenagers and need to often work from home but with spotty internet I pay a fortune for, we are out of options."
"helena of Issaquah, WA","Aug. 31, 2015",1,"I first got Comcast over a year ago at my apartment. I got everything set up and ready to go while on the phone with them, and asked them if I could make my first payment ahead of time. Whomever I spoke with proceeded to tell me my first month was free since I was a new customer. I did not remember ever seeing that anywhere, but was also happy when they mentioned it. So my first bill comes and it is double what my bill was supposed to be and it says I have a late fee added since I did not pay my first bill!Confused I called the customer service which btw is terrible!!! The lady I spoke with was so unbelievably rude I was in such shock. Telling me that I do not know what I am talking about, etc. She hung up on me eventually. I was so angry. They continued to add late charge fees even after I paid my bill. After 4 months of having Comcast I cancelled because I was so angry with the way they treated me. I swore I would never get them again...To my luck, my new house I just moved into only receives Comcast in this area. So I signed up for Comcast internet and they quoted me 59.99 a month for a speed of 105. I picked up the modem and went to call to activate it. Comcast then told me my account had been cancelled. (WTF) I had just started service with them 4 days prior! So then I got transferred a total of 8 times and was asked to verify who I was 15 times making the phone call a total of 3 hours. Eventually I was able to get my original rate back for the same speed (or so they told me).I was not getting any internet whatsoever... The speed was sooo slow I could not even load one page on the internet. Angry and confused I call them back to now find out that I am paying 59.99 a month for a speed of only 50. They then proceed to put me on hold for 25 mins two times! Saying to have 105 speed I need to pay $20 extra a month. I am now not happy. After arguing they then reduce it down to only an extra $5 a month. So now my plan is $65.99 a month. I then proceed to ask for them to email me over my price sheet and contract so I have evidence and a paper trail of all of this and he tells me that he is not able to do that. I HATE COMCAST !!! What can you do to fight back against them if they try to overcharge me, etc. They make me worried to have them as a company. They are stupid, liars, and not trustworthy."
"Garth of Bellingham, WA","Aug. 31, 2015",1,"We have used Xfinity for years. Unfortunately, there are few alternatives. They change the bill amount at least three times a year, make us call, tell us they will fix it and then we call back next month. They say one thing and do another. Today when we called, ""We have no record that you previously called."" This is common and very irritating. I would go with any other company if I could."
"Colleen of Southfield, MI","Aug. 31, 2015",1,I recently tried to switch to Comcast from AT&T to get faster internet speed. I ordered the self install kit which I was supposed to be able to plug in and login to activate with current service lines... That didn't work. I called to have it installed by one of their technicians; When I went to setup my Smart TV to connect to the WiFi it wouldn't connect. After spending 2 hours on the phone troubleshooting I was told it was the TV and I would need to contact their troubleshooting department. What kind of service can't connect the WiFi to a TV? I called to then cancel the service. I don't have the time to have them keep coming out to correct it when it should have been done at the time of install. After all that's said and done I was billed $125 for what... No service and a huge headache. Absolutely unbelievable. When I called to question why I was billed it was for the service (that I never had). I will not recommend Xfinity to anyone for any reason. AT&T has great customer service and they're reliable. I wish a little faster internet but I will take it any day over dealing with Comcast Xfinity ever again.
"Vinesh of Sacramento, CA","Aug. 29, 2015",1,"Wow wow wow that's all I can say... Comcast is gone from top to rock bottom... Worst internet service ever. Even terrible than AT&T. I have signed them like 3 weeks ago and the speed I am getting is 3 to 4 mbps. I have to call the support daily and I mean daily. Only thing I hear is that ""Sir we will credit you 20 since you aren't getting what you are suppose to"". I mean really. My bill I checked is 311. They are freaking charging me for the tech guys who was here to fix the problem and yet nothing has been fixed. This is ** so and get SureWest. They are 1000000 times better than this suckers."
"Denia of Philadelphia, PA","Aug. 28, 2015",1,"I am so tired of Comcast. I had to move twice this summer. It was unfortunate but it's something I had to do. When I moved both times my bill was paid. However, when I go online to pay it for the next month there is a bill of $898.07 and there is no breakdown of how my bill actually amounted to that much. My bill is usually a little over $200 a month. So I called and chatted online to see what was going on. And they basically stated that the bill was created from my previous residence. I don't understand how that can be when I paid every month, how do I have a back payment of $420? They refuse to change the bill claiming that everything on my acct adds up to $898. Which is ridiculous because only Comcast can see the breakdown of my bill and I cannot see it on my end. I am so frustrated with this company. They just don't give a crap about the customer period."
"Franco of Ridgefield, CT","Sept. 23, 2015",1,"Finally on Friday, Sept 11 another technician came to install., at first he said he was coming to install inside the house, but could not because the drop bury work has not been done yet - I was speechless.Fortunately for my family and me this time the technician knows his job and wants to go the extra time with dedication and effort. He investigated, removed some dirt and found that there was already a tube going below the street from the pole to my house; he uncovered that and voila! There was the drop bury ready for him to bring the cable down to my home (it was probably there all the time and the rest did not bother to check). Long story short, he spent the next 3 hours or so installing the services with a fabulous attitude, service, etc. This person did an awesome job.Original ReviewIt has been without doubts the worst Customer Experience ordeal. 08/02/2015 - Call Comcast sales to requesting cable+Internet+phone service for my new home as I have been recently relocated to Connecticut, and subscribed for a 2-year agreement for Starter XF Triple Play bundle. Paid $197.45 for install+1st month of service. 08/24/2015 - Technician arrives to my address on-time but says that he cannot install as there is no cable from the pole to my house and he needs to call the ""higher fix"" team. He says somebody will contact me to reschedule for a second appointment. 08/26/2015 - Nobody has call in two days so I contact Customer Service and they schedule a second visit for 08/27/15.08/27/2015 - Technician#8023 arrives on-time but after inspecting - same thing the first technician did - he says that he can't continue and will need the ""Construction Team"" to schedule a THIRD visit, and reiterates that somebody will call me to schedule it. Technician left a copy of a Construction Drop Referral Form JOB # 162031.08/27/2015 - I contacted Customer Service by web chat just to find out that my account was Voluntarily Closed - needless to say I didn't do such a thing. After spending more than an hour the agent representative did not offer any solution that was not opening a new service request from scratch. I will not expand on how many times I explain the situation as just to write it down seems a waste of time, but I am attaching the full transcript."
"SUNG of Oro Valley, AZ","Aug. 28, 2015",1,"Before I complain about the Comcast internet service, I have to mention this. I am a Korean and had the fastest internet service in my country with low monthly payment. AND there is no limitation for the usage. Yesterday night, one message was popped up on my computer. It said my data usage reached almost 90% of my plan. I was shocked and angry. Data usage limitation? I haven't heard about that before. So I called Comcast internet customer service. The customer representative said there is no data usage limitation on internet. She added that if the message keep popping up then contact Comcast internet security service. All of sudden, she said since I have been their customer almost 9 years she recommended to change the service program, as a bundle of internet and cable TV for $59. It was attractive but I said I was OK with my program now. But she kept pushing me to have the new bundle. So I said since I was not sure if I stayed in the same place in next year, I did not like to have one. But she said there should be no early termination and even if so they could handle it. I didn't and don't believe her words. But that was not an issue. So, in this morning, I felt uncomfortable about the message again, and called Comcast again. I asked about the data cap and the customer service representative said there is none. So I talked about the message but she said there is no data limitation for home internet service. I asked her to transfer my call to her manager. Then, she transferred my call to security department! The security department guy said they could not help me because I am not the account holder. I explained that I was calling for my wife and I am the one who pay the monthly payment. Then they explained me that there IS data cap/limitation. What a bummer... I argued that I did not sign on the contract under data limitation. He said it was implemented. So I argued that the Comcast only shows customer two different speed internet service without explaining data cap. And he said normal speed internet has cap of 250 GB and high-speed internet was 350 GB limitation. I haven't hear of that. I quickly searched about that while I was on the phone and found only a handful cities in the U.S. have the cap, and Tucson AZ is one of them. That guy explained me that since I normally used under 300 GB except only one month I did not have to worry about the data cap and if I use more than that, they are going to charge 50 GB for $10 more.I argued that I had no memory to read that policy through their official letter and I had no reason to agree with the data cap because I signed the contract back in 2006. And I asked him whether there was another choice or different program. He said he could transfer my call to their sales department. But he transferred me to data usage department. I had to explain the same subject over and over again. The technician did not know what to do with my question. He did not even know there is a limitation. He said he could check the internet connection. So I said I was not talking about internet connection. Then he transferred my call to sales department. The sales department guy said there is no limitation again! And all of sudden she said there is. I told her I did not like to have limitation on internet usage. She said then I have to choose $350 internet service. And she added that was the only option, otherwise I have to pay $78 per month plus over usage fee for every 50 GB with $10. I just wasted my 2 and half hours with useless call and customer service. There was no way I could get help from them. Like you see, half of them didn't know their internet service has data usage limitation. Other half did know but couldn't handle my complaint. I did not sign up for the stupid internet data cap. If that service is like other mobile phone service, I cannot help accepting it (Verizon forced me to resign contract from unlimited data plan to 7 GB limited data family plan. Otherwise I could not change my broken Samsung smartphone) BUT, the home internet service is supposed to be unlimited. Internet itself is democratic and the providers are not.One comment the security department guy told me was like this, ""There is a limitation, but even if there is, we do not disconnect your internet service. However the fee on your billing reflects the usage, 50 GB for $10. That's why the customer representative said there is no limitation."" For my entire life I haven't heard that kind of logic. Only word I can think of the event is GREEDY BASTARD. I like to join a class action if there is active one now."
"sophie of Jacksonville, FL","Aug. 24, 2015",1,"I have a triple play service, and I use my phone and Wi-Fi for a work at home job. I don't understand why Comcast is running stating it is easy to move with Comcast when it is clearly untrue. I called on Thursday august 20th, asking to transfer my services. But I emphasized on the fact that I didn't want any problems with my line because I needed for work. On Sunday I wasted more than 3 hours on the phone with Comcast just so they can make it right. After speaking to more than 5 agents and doing lot of troubleshooting, it seemed to work. Now today, Monday august 24th, to my big surprise, I saw that I was assigned a new number. Therefore I am not able to work because I have to wait for them to get my old number back and after that I have to wait for another technician to remove all the features. This is not right. This is not acceptable for one of the biggest company. I wouldn't write this long review if it was the first time this problem occurred. Indeed, this is the second time. You can mark my words whenever I will get the opportunities to switch to another company, I will do it. Comcast failed to deliver on their promises. Why every time I called to make a small change to my services, there is a problem with my services. No I don't get it. There was only one instance I was late on my bill and it was just for one day. The agent had to lecture like a kid before waiving half of the fees. Every time you speak to an agent, be prepared for a different answer. This is not worthy. There is no company that treat me so poorly. COMCAST deserves to be named the WORST COMPANY in the USA. As of right now (Monday August 24th 2015) I lost a whole day of work because of the incompetence and lack of care of Comcast, and unfortunately, I am still counting the hours that I will lose. They promised to call me back and I am still waiting. My situation is different. I need to work in order to pay my bills. My husband lost his job and I can't afford to put my kids in jeopardy. Back in February, I lost two days because of the same issue. I called to remove the tv from the triple package and the next day I found out I had a new number. "
"Sandra of Seattle, WA","Aug. 23, 2015",1,"I bought the 30-day access pass to Xfinity for $54.95. Most of the time, the wireless internet is slower than a dial up connection and often quits working entirely. It is close to not usable. Recently I went to a mall close by and there was an Xfinity stand with a representative. I told him the problem and he said something like ""oh yeah, to those one month subscriptions we give the slowest speed we have, 6 mbps."" I should come see him and sign up for a cheaper and better subscription once this 30 day pass is expired, and I could also terminate it at any time. How can I subscribe to Xfinity, if this 30 day test is already as bad as it can be?"
"cathy of North Port, FL","Aug. 21, 2015",1,"You know I have had Comcast/Xfinity service forever and no matter where I moved to I never had a problem keeping my email address. In the last 7 yrs I have moved 3x and the last 2 addresses I lived at where I had created the email and then where I moved to I had no problem taking it w/ me but now this past May I had to move and the email was fine until this week. I received email up to 10:17 pm on Monday night. When I couldn't access my email on Tues I called Comcast. I verified my last 2 previous addresses that I lived at where I used this email and I was told by Wednesday night I would have my email transferred to my new acct.Mind you it took 5 phones calls on Tues. but guess what it didn't happen on Wednesday so I called them again and again and again... Do you know since Tues morning I have been on the phone w/ Comcast for a total of 20 hrs. Finally tonight I called again at 513 pm which lasted for 2hrs 18 mins bc my email is still not transferred and guess what they are telling me that they have to call me tomorrow to verify my last 2 previous addresses again even though I have verified it every day since I've called on Tues... Jesus Christ doesn't even expect me to verify myself this much. Mind you for the last 3 days I have given them that info every time I spoke to or was transferred to someone... I believe I must've been transferred to 10 people including a supervisor tonight on this 2 hr 18 min phone call and can I tell you that my issue is still pending and not resolved... that's what they call great customer service.Now I have to wait til tomorrow, verify my last 2 addresses and then it will take 72 hrs to appear on my acct. It's a good thing I'm NOT dying or counting on an important email. Can I tell you that as soon as I can get out of this contract I am transferring my internet service to Verizon since I already have cell phone service w/ them and they don't treat their customers like this. I have had Verizon since 2002 so that's where I'll be taking my internet service. Before you decide to transfer to Comcast check out your options bc yea they are a large company but their customer service stinks. I work for Walmart and I know all about customer service and how to treat and take care of the customer. Sorry Comcast but you failed and receive a F in taking care of the customer. Everyone deserves good customer service no matter where or who you work for."
"Emily of Grand Island, FL","Aug. 20, 2015",5,"I've been with Comcast since 2011 now. We switched to them because they were the only way to get fast service in Central Florida, beyond 10 Mb/s. This is where I differ from a lot of reviews for this company. We've had service interruptions, but they are infrequent, and usually are being worked on by the time we call customer service. We have had to replace our modem twice, once because the wireless router failed, another time because lightning may have fried it. However getting a replacement was as simple as driving to their office, dropping off the old one, and picking up a new one after we call ahead. Then installation is just me putting in the new one and calling their tech support to send it an update and it's done. Our speed has universally been faster than advertised. Originally we had 15 mb/s, but we consistently rated at 25 mb/s on Speedtest.net even when picking an out of state source.We later upgraded to 50 mb/s when it became available, and they gave us 65 mb/s. Just recently they upgraded the lines and gave us 75 mb/s for no charge, and now here's my latest speed test - 88.5 mb/s! We also picked up TV service through them recently, and we have seen a lower total bill plus fewer outages when compared to Dish. While their On Demand forces you to watch commercials by refusing to let you fast forward, it is extensive. In short the only two problems I have had with them is their new computer that directs customer service calls has a tendency to hang up, and their On Demand won't let you fast forward. The actual people are helpful, and their service is reliable. I know people complain about this company a lot, but at least in Lake County, Florida, their service is the best."
"Jason of Rancoh Mirage, CA","Aug. 19, 2015",1,"I attempted to initiate service with Xfinity last week. It has taken me over 5 hours of phone calls to try to get service. I still do not have any. Initially, the customer service agent failed to take my e-mail, explain to me the new landline number, and took my last name incorrectly. I was supposed to receive a self install shipment of supplies. The shipment never came. Luckily, I called to check on the status. After being on hold for 25 minutes I was told that the order never took place. I waited another 25 minutes for a supervisor. The equipment was received the following day. I waited on hold 20 minutes to speak to an activation representative. Then waited another 25 minutes to be called back by the same rep. The activation was unsuccessful and I waited another 30 minutes to speak to a supervisor. This has been followed by approximately another 75 minutes in phone calls to supervisors who attempt to give you their word that your issue will be resolved, but in reality, you are one of over 20 million customers whom they provide service to. Your business means nothing to this company. They have a sales and representative force that is poorly skilled and overwhelmed. It is truly sad to think that this is the state of customer service in 2015. I have been met with a litany of inexcusable, incompetent service thus far. What began as a simple phone call to start service has turned into the worst and most time consuming lack of customer service experience I have ever experienced. If there was another option in my area, I would rapidly flee to it. Any other provider, DirecTV, Dish, Time Warner, etc. would be a welcome choice. I DO NOT recommend Comcast Xfinity based on my statements above. Simple fact is that they have too many customers, a poorly skilled customer service force, and are unable to accommodate the volume or service area this billion dollar company has taken on."
"Cecilio of Hollywood, FL","Aug. 19, 2015",1,"Comcast sells 75 mbps service. My connection is, most of the time, under 0.9. Complains take 30 minutes. Improvement: none. Why are they allowed to stay in business?"
"Mary of Brunswick, ME","Aug. 17, 2015",1,When we moved to Maine last year we were not told about them having a data cap. It wasn't until over a year later when we somehow started going WAY over our data cap that we learned of it. I am very upset that we were not told about this when we ordered our service. I feel like we have been taken advantage of. We have no other option for internet in this area or cable for that matter and are stuck with this horrible company who thinks it's okay to lie to people and cheat them. I do not think we have gone over ever. I think it's their attempt to get more money from us. No added devices or more data use but somehow we went from using under 150 mb to over 300 mb? I don't think so. Seems fishy to me.
"Emily of Jacksboro , TN","Aug. 16, 2015",1,"I am very upset with Comcast and have been since August 7th. I signed up for online bill pay and forgot the next month that I had done that so my TV and Internet was cut off, that was okay and my fault, so I paid $170 to get it turned back on and here it is 8 days later and it's still off. I have to talked to 5 or 6 different people. One of which hung up on me, one said I just needed my box reset, another said that the $170 that came out of my bank account, that I paid isn't showing up in the system. I have called over and over and this problem still isn't resolved. My TV is still off. I'm still getting bills in the mail with it being off. I'm out almost $200 with no TV or Internet. Money that I could have used to cancel my ridiculous and inconvenient contract. I've never seen such an awful lack of communication. I'm very disappointed and upset with paying over $152 every month for one TV and internet, and now this."
"Mary of Nashville, TN","Aug. 16, 2015",1,"I am receiving two fees for installation totaling $60. After the installation, the operator told me one fee was for the truck to come to the house and one for hooking up the modem. We already had service hooked up to the house as the neighbors in our townhouse already have Comcast. This to me sounds like two fees for the same service. They didn't show up to the first appointment at all. We had to schedule another one. Making this a two and half week process. The hidden fees and poor customer service provided by Comcast is making me search for a better company. I do not recommend this company."
"Vanessa of Oakland, CA","Aug. 15, 2015",1,"Being a Comcast faithful customer for a 1 year and a half they are not there for the customer. You can pay up 224.00 a month for a year but they will increase your plan without even notify on discounts. Comcast is not for the customer!!! Grant it, I know it's good business because in the area I'm in you can only get Comcast, but for someone who has been trying to pay!!! And has been faithful for months. I remember they took my money out of my account then say I didn't pay it. When they found it, they applied it. Great, but they couldn't tell me my discounts was expire, let's see if we can get you on another plan. No help.I have three kids, work full time, trying to finish school as well. My income is not a lot, yet I remember paying 620.00 a month just to get out of a hole only for them to increase my payments from 170.00 to 230.00 without notification! When I paid that 621.00 yes, I thought that covered the next month. Again, it's not like I did not pay!!! Now my bill is 726.00, that's more than what can afford to pay for a service that's not help, not for the customer and loves raping in the pockets!!! They won't even work with me on getting it down to something reasonable. Nobody has 462.00 to pay for cable yet alone 726.00. Robbery!!!"
"Debra of Sicklerville, NJ","Aug. 15, 2015",1,"Service shut off twice this year after not receiving the bills.

This is it for me. I hate greedy monopolies that deliver poor customer service!"
"Susan of Glen Ellyn, IL","Aug. 14, 2015",1,"Trying to get services reactivated with Comcast after they in error deactivated services was a very disappointing/exasperating experience. Customer Satisfaction was not a priority or concern of agents. After dealing with Customer Solutions, Technical Solutions, Billing and devoting over 5 hours of time on the phone with the various departments and repeating numerous times the problem and account information, I have given up! Only two of the services within bundle are reactivated and phone services could not be restored due to outdated modem. Service Technician to reinstall a new modem couldn't come to home for over 1 week. Prior to Comcast deactivating service in error all services were working without issue. Comcast Xfinity does not provide satisfactory customer service."
"Veronica of Chicago, IL","Aug. 13, 2015",1,"Never getting Comcast again!!! They suckered me into a two year contract because I thought they were giving me a good deal, ended up paying over $220 a month for their services. Now I'm canceling and I have returned equipment over three weeks ago and I get another bill and I get charged yet another month!!! I have been calling numerous amount of times and no luck. I have just been getting the run around. I'm currently on hold for 28 minutes before getting an answer. Now all they say is ""please call back on the status"" and when I do call back the next person says the same. I'm guessing I'm just gonna keep getting charge until they finally feel like disconnecting. Comcast is not about their customers. I have been stuck with a little money problem and they are not compassionate nor understanding. I just keep getting charged and I'm getting no help at all. I warn everybody about Comcast scamming people."
"Nina of Bethesda, MD","Aug. 12, 2015",1,"Comcast has one of the worst customer service telephone service in the business. It takes at least 10-15 min to get to speak to a live representative, after that, repetitive confirmation questions which apparently are not saved in the system after being transferred numerous times to get to the right person. After I finally reached an X1 service representative, he dropped my call and I had to wait another 10-15 min to get another representative. Finally, Dave did help me to resolve my question (log in ID and password to access X1 on iPad), but could not find any record of my previous communication with the prior X1 representative who dropped my call after confirming my identity and account, then putting me on hold.Overall, 40 min of my life wasted, something that could have been accomplished in less than 10 min. This is not just one occasion, this is EVERY time Comcast Customer Service is contacted. They are verbally polite, but excessively so, and more importantly, are either incompetent or do not care. Often times in my experience, this may be rooted in not being taken care of well by the company themselves.If Comcast wants to keep me and thousand of others as customers, telephone customer service system needs to be corrected for automated system redundancies and incomplete options, inefficiencies, lack of accountability and a major waste of time Comcast is repetitively putting its customers through. Look at other reviews. This is not an isolated incident. This is a systemic problem!"

"Merle of Cumming, GA","Aug. 12, 2015",1,"I arranged for a technician to evaluate for home security. I have an existing service. 4 separate technician visits suggested by Comcast could not figure out how to integrate my system. Canceled the attempted transfer. Comcast canceled all of my preexisting 2 year discounts on my 3 services without notice. They miscoded cancellation of security install in their system. They are billing me for services, tech visits, and equipment I never had. I have been on site at store twice. Received 2 different quotes on new costs. Billing not adjusted to reflect Comcast error. Billing us $622.28 for service I don't have. Additionally someone during this process in Comcast altered my social security number. I could not access services. I had to go into a store and present a social security card. No follow up on either issue from any management as was promised. My bill is due 8/13/15. I have been dealing with these errors since April when my number was altered.Updated on 08/19/2015: I spoke with my escalation case manager yesterday afternoon to discuss issues listed above. In addition I noted additional charges on my online account information. The additional charges are unexplained at this time. It was noted that although these show up on my online account they do not show up on Comcast system. It was also explained that online charges, even if incorrect, do not disappear until the next billing cycle. The explanation for the 3 different quoted cost of the same services by 3 different representatives is this. There are different levels of representatives. Each level has a list of price quotes for services. This indicates that the pricing may be selected for your services by the level of the representative. Is this consistent and a fair practices way of charging customers?The third topic was how my personal information could suddenly change in their system. The case manager stated he tried to recreate that scenario while we were on the phone and the system did not allow it to be done. We discussed this at length as there were inferences that perhaps somehow this was not done by Comcast at all. If not, does this attempt to shift blame back to me, the consumer, who does not have access unless done in person. I cited another person with a similar issue and was told he had never come across this before. It was documented in their system as to the date this change was first encountered. This allowed me to again stress that this was an unauthorized and unknown intrusion into my personal account information. I have requested further escalation to a management level. My case manager was unable to answer one question when the charges online are corrected."
"Charlyne of Fargo, ND","Aug. 11, 2015",1,"When I called to establish service they had to call me back. Their ""system"" was too slow to tell me if I was in their area. I then spent 30 minutes going through their options and establishing service. I received a call the next day and was told that even though I had set up a installation date and established service with them they could not come out and connect service on the first of the month because there was already service at the house. Until that was cancelled they could not install mine. I have moved numerous times and I have never heard this before. The representative was unwilling to try to explain the issue in a way that made any sense and would not let me speak to a manager. In the end, I told him that I did not want service through Xfinity and would find another provider."
"Stephanie of Boulder, CO","Aug. 11, 2015",1,"I was told I would be charged a $100 unreturned equipment fee upon cancelling my service with Comcast. The fee is for a cable box that I received as a part of my internet package. By the time I found out about this, I had moved out of my sublet and my landlord had thrown out the box. When I was given the box by an Xfinity employee, I was not told in any way that I had to return it or that there was a fee associated with it. In fact, I did not even need the box, as I did not have a tv inside my sublet. I have called customer services a few times to try to get the fee waived, but they were very dismissive and told me that nothing could be done about it. I would be okay with the fee if it had been verbally clear to be that the cable box was rental equipment and had to be returned, but since I wasn't, I feel incredibly scammed and disrespected as a customer."
"Christy of Spokane , WA","Aug. 11, 2015",1,"I've been dealing with Comcast for 3 years now. I have watched commercials that brag about their wonderful service and their great, wonderful customer service. I don't find their service to be wonderful or great. I don't find them to be a step ahead of the rest, they're actually a step behind the rest to using cable and routers. Representatives are rude and you get disconnected if you're one day late even after 3 years. My thought is to just go back to DIRECTV because I never had a single problem and it costs a third of the price that Comcast has cost me. I feel like Comcast is a big fat waste of money and time."

We then go to the second Tier, which hangs up before we start so I have to call again. There seems to a blaming of my Gateway which is constantly misnamed a ""Modem"" or ""Router.""

We set it up ourselves and it worked fine for the first 2 weeks. All the sudden it stopped working for no reason. We called someone to come out here and they didn't tell us it would cost a dime. After waiting a week for them to send someone out, my boyfriend waited at home all day from the 8am-11pm timeframe they gave us. They showed up an hour after; he obviously was out running errands after sitting all day waiting for them. We had to call to reschedule. Another 5 days went by before they could someone out for a second time. They ended up fixing the internet. However they screwed up our TV (DirecTV who is awesome!) and WE had to end up paying DirecTV to come out here to fix what Comcast screwed up. We cancelled our service with Comcast before our month was even up and I was told by not one, but two different (surprisingly nice and helpful) customer service representatives that they were sorry for our trouble, ""it sounds terrible"" and that we wouldn't be charged anything for the service. What a joke. They ended up sending us to collections for $94.76. My boyfriend paid it so it wouldn't hurt his credit. I called and spoke with Comcast and THE RUDEST person was ""helping me"" and told me that it ""didn't matter what the other people had told me and this is the way it is."" Now looking through the bill I'm also seeing some ** ""Failed CHSI Sik"" charge for $99.99. Which would mean what, exactly, Comcast?? The most **, shady company in the industry. We hate them so much that we literally would rather not have the internet at all than work with Comcast. And in this day in age you can imagine how tough that is. But I refuse to give that miserable place another penny. Don't ever do business with them. The only reason they are still in business is because there are not many other options out there. Just remember Comcast, Karma is a **. Can't wait to see you slowly fail."
"Erin of Mokelumne Hill, CA","Aug. 8, 2015",1,"From Oct of 2014 to March 2015 I spent over 11 hours on the phone with this company working out problems that they had messed up on. Staring off their website when I was considering buying has the deal pop up sliding window. They had a deal for $20 month internet. But when you clicked on it it always disappeared and internet deal started at $50-$60 a month and I did not have location devices on my computer while this was happening. And when I called the company asking for the $20 deal, they said there was no such promotion that had ever been going on. So I stupidly still signed up with them and they gave me the wrong equipment. Not only that but they gave me two cable boxes. Which I had to return. They overcharged me three times on my bill. One of the times I spent 2 growling hours on the phone with a payment support agent who told me at the end of the phone call after he could not figure out for two hours what was going wrong with my bill. He said that he could not change it after all that time and that I would have to call back again tomorrow and have them fix the problem. And even when that wasn't happening they had their company's collectors calling me asking me to pay the bill days after it had been payed. I have two addresses that I used internet at. Called to pay on one they say the bill is paid. Then a couple days later my internet is shut off at the one I requested to pay on. When I called to find out what it happened they had paid towards a future billing on the other place and not the place I asked. This kind of incompetent behavior goes on every time you talk to them not to mention that every time I called I would have to speak to a min of 3 different people to get help on a problem. No one knows what they're doing there and they just pass it off to another department which is always the wrong department. I'm not kidding when I say 11 hrs on the phone with them. I kept track after the third phone call in a month. They say I owe them $100 dollars for the last bill. I told them they owed me money for all the bs. I also have the Internet box which I don't even want but I'm not giving them their stuff back if they won't erase my bill. They are an EXTREMELY fraudulent company and should be dealt with. If they offered $1 month Internet it's not worth the stress."
"Deborah of Stafford, VA","Aug. 8, 2015",1,"Comcast has had my bundle business for quite a few years, so you would think that they would want to provide good customer service. Well think again. I called two weeks ago (the week of 20 July 2015) to ask them to come and move my cable line which is buried in the ground. I am trying to have a garage build and the line is in the way. I was given an appointment of Thursday, Aug. 6th. They were a no show. I called and was given another appointment of 8/8 between 9-11 AM. No show. I called a third time and was they would be here today 8/8 between 2-4:30 and still they never came. I am at my wit's end."
"Edmond of Riverside, IL","Aug. 7, 2015",1,"My internet cable was broken in a storm and when I asked them to repair it, they told me they were going to come the next day. No one showed up, and when I called them, they had scheduled an appointment two weeks later. I have many medical issues, and I need to connect with the doctor daily to transfer information and check different appointments. I told them my situation and they still didn't care. If you don't care about people, how do you expect people to care about you? They only come fast when you order their service. After that, they don't. Terrible company, terrible customer service."
"Therese of Glenview, IL","Aug. 6, 2015",1,"I'm so tired of the excuses I get for lose of cable. It rains - I lose!!! The technician 2-hour window is a joke when they come 5 minutes before the 2-hour window is almost over. I've been told by a tech that someone else needed to come out. I had one only spend 5 minutes in my home -- RUDE, gave me no name, and told me to call tomorrow for a new tech that can fix my problem. My sisters have AT&T and don't lose as much as I do. They are reading off a screen and don't care!!! I'm hiring a lawyer for the time I spend wasted on waiting on the phone or waiting for them - can be spent with my child!!! I once was on the phone on HOLD for 1 hour 15 minutes!!! If I could give zero stars I would."
"Matt of Bonita Springs, FL","Aug. 6, 2015",5,"I have had Comcast/Xfinity services for 3 years now, and in that time I don't think my services have been down more than 12 hours which boils down to a 0.0456621% downtime, or 99.954% uptime. That's an amazing statistic! And to top that off, I live in SWFL, the lightning capital of the world!!! I have internet speeds up to 90 megabytes down, and up to 12 megabytes up, I have unlimited US/Canada/PR/Guam calling, and a few hundred channels to watch at a cost of $160 a month.People complain about the cost of cable, but the way I look at it it's a great deal, and a lot of service for the money spent. Heck, 20 years ago my phone bill alone was $200 a month (and what was $200 worth 20 years ago?) But now I can talk all I want without the worry of how many long-distance minutes I was using, and how much it cost. In addition, I have blazing fast internet which keeps everyone in my household connected to the whole world!In an earlier post I read about someone complaining that if they pay for a service, electric, water, or cable, they expect cost-free service and maintenance. First off, people tend to forget that TV is a luxury, not a necessity! Secondly, if your kitchen sink is leaking does the water company come out and fix it for free? If a light switch is broken, does the electric company fix that for free? Then why do people expect that if you have 35 year old coax wiring in your home that it's the cable companies problem? I do electrical work, and must tell you that 30 year old RG59 coax cable will not reliably support today's technology. If you want the latest & greatest tech, you need lines that will support that technology."
"Jose of St. Augustine, FL","Aug. 6, 2015",1,"I've been a Comcast Customer for over 8 years. Recently Comcast raised my monthly service to over $200 per month. I called to cancel in May and was sent to the ""recovery"" department. I was offered a deal so I would stay. A month later I called to cancel my service once more, as I was not completely satisfied with what I was offered. I was transferred to the ""recovery"" department again where I was given, what I can see today as, a ""too good to be true"" deal. The individual offered to lower my monthly to around $160 per month total and would increase my internet to 50mbps, plus phone. I really did not need the phone as I have a cellphone plan but the internet MBPS increase got my attention. And he promised that this rate will not increase for 2 years, and that I could cancel if not satisfied.I was in the middle of traveling for work so I decided to try it. He said I had to listen and accept something over the phone and then I would receive an email, so I did. This month my bill was $200 again and I could not believe it! I was very upset, so I called to cancel my service for cable but decided that I would keep my internet. I was told that I could cancel but because I am into a 2 year agreement I would have to pay $250 cancellation fee. I was speechless to say the least. I explained that I never signed anything to what I was asked if I had to go thru a phone acceptance. To make the story short, I was tricked into a 2 year contract I guess because I called so many times to cancel, that whoever I talked to decided to lock me in so I would not be able to call to cancel again.After trying to make them understand that I was tricked into this and what I was told, I finally gave up due to the Comcast representative lack of interest in resolving the issue. I feel so betrayed by the company I have given my loyalty and business for so long that I decided to cancel anyway and take the $250 hit. Unfortunately I need my internet and the only other ISP is not the best. So I told him I needed to keep my internet. I got hit a second time by Comcast telling me that because I am cancelling an agreement, the only internet plan I can get is 105 mbps for a cost of $114 plus fees and taxes. WOW! All I need is a maximum of 25 mbps but I cannot even get that from Comcast after I pay them the $250 unfair fee. This company has changed a lot! I remember when they used to care about their Customers. Now they treat you well ONLY when you do not have a contract and when you do not call to complaint. The strength of a company that provides a service and/or a product is on their Customer service department. It is how well and effective they can resolve Customer situations, so you can keep your Customers. After searching the internet looking for answers, I just found out that Comcast is at the top of the list but for worst Customer service! I can see that... I guess Comcast has become so big and ""business"" like that people have just become a $ money icon for them. They do not care anymore... It looks like they do not mind the turn over as new Customers keep signing up every day now."
"Nope of Nadda, OR","Aug. 5, 2015",1,I pay my bill monthly. I am always on time. But Comcast can't even provide a reliable service! The internet cuts out. There are HOURS that go by without any service. I call in and try to contact support and I get thrown through a roundabout of machines only for them to tell me they can't do anything about it. Comcast is the worst internet provider I have ever seen. They don't care about giving you service. They don't care if you are satisfied. They don't even want to provide you with good service. All they want is to take your money and ** off. For three weeks straight I've had the worst internet service you can imagine! It is a horrendous business. Never give them your money.
"Gracie of Gadsden, AL","Aug. 5, 2015",1,"I am having to use my data on my phone to even be on this site right now because my WiFi is not working, which isn't unusual. They have the worst customer service ever. It took them a week and 3 days just to get my cable working and I still have problems with it way more than what I should. They are way more expensive than what they should be if you think about what you are truly getting for the price. They should be ashamed. I definitely don't recommend them at all. Just because it seems like it might be a good deal at the time doesn't mean it really is. Too much ** and ignorance to deal with. I would rather be attacked by a puma with brass knuckles on a regular basis than to have to deal with this company any longer. I am switching tomorrow."
"Brady of San Ramon, FL","Aug. 4, 2015",1,"EXPLORE OTHER AVENUES TO GET CABLE & INTERNET! My experience with Xfinity and Comcast seems to be the same as everyone else... Service is the worst I have ever been exposed to. Customer Support never knows what is going on, if it is set up and working, you're fine. GOD forbid if you have an issue... My Issue: moving and trying to transfer services. They shut my service off too early, and then have not been able to get it back up and running effectively for some reason. They canceled my scheduled appointment for no reason, of which I set a month ago. They randomly were adding disconnection and connection fees - of which they shut off by mistake.After 4 days and 8 different people, they still can't get the information correct. Was told on 3 calls that a supervisor would call with in 2 hours... It's been 1.5 weeks not a single call back. Transferred from department to department all saying they took care of it to find out in an hour that nothing was done and had to call back - YET again... We are supposed to get 100mb and we are paying for the higher amount - of which we never get. So now they are telling me I can get faster if I upgrade yet again. REALLY?? Had a service tech scheduled - waiting, waiting, waiting... Oh nope... He never showed and no reasons given. LOL - now they want me to sign with a 2 year agreement!! Are you kidding me!! AT&T is not as fast (I get that) BUT it is a lot less headache and far better service. Trust me, that is not saying much..."
"Tom of Coon Rapids , MN","Aug. 2, 2015",2,"I call and call and get the same old responses which never help. They only want to sell me something to better my experience. Blast is what I need to get a better connection for my internet, they say. I don't want Blast, they put it in my account anyway. I ask for them to remove Blast ($12.99/month), they remove it. A month later I see Blast back on my account. Comworst is such a scam. If I were scamming people the way they do I would of been locked up long ago. I always say, if you ain't got tons of money in this world, you ain't nothing."
"don of Brentwood, TN",42216,1,"So they tell me now that I'm getting 75 mbps internet speed. And often I do. But then again, often I end up with .35 mbps.. that's point 35. Slow enough that my internet service is useless and I have to leave my home to continue with my job. For years they have been coming to my house, trying to charge me $75 per trip to fix THEIR ISSUE. It's intermittently messed up so by the time they get around to helping me, it's ok again. And then they say things like, ""it's hard to fix something when it's ok when we get here."" (I send them speed reports to prove it was slow.) The supervisors say they will do what it takes to fix it and then they do nothing.When the techs get here they say things like, ""we saw the issues you are having in the office on our equipment so we know you are having issues"" but then nothing ever gets fixed. I'M SICK OF IT BUT I REFUSE TO GIVE UP. I DEMAND THAT I GET THE SERVICE THEY ARE CLAIMING THEY PROVIDE. AND I REFUSE TO GO TO A LESSER SPEED SYSTEM LIKE DISH OR AT&T."
"George of Bastrop, TX",42216,1,"I called the Comcast Xfinity hotline to get internet only (no TV, no home phone). There was no option to set it up online. The rep put me on hold for about 10 min to ""put some packages together."" Then she claimed that the best option for me was a promotional package 75mb/sec for $39.99 plus monthly $10 for modem rental. I explained that I already had a modem that I would want to use. I told her that this was quite expensive and asked if she had something cheaper. She replied that the only other ""package"" she had was for $29.99 for 6mb/sec. All in all she was a bit snotty during our conversation and was quick to hang up after I said I want to explore other providers."
"Michael of Charleston, SC",42215,1,"My internet service has been unreliable for a majority of the 2 years since a move outside of AT&T range forced me back into Comcast Xfinity's monopoly. I'm on my 3rd rental modem, 3rd technician (2 no shows), and countless hours of phone calls. The customer service center seems designed to stall or aggravate you to hang up by having you repeat the same information many times, then keeping no account details when trying to reference previous calls, so you are always starting from scratch. Very frustrating to feel like Comcast is my only option and to be treated like they know it."
"Shrikant of Pembroke Pines, FL",42213,1,"I got Comcast internet with telephone this month for the first time. To avoid monthly modem fees I opted to buy modem on my own and Comcast rep suggested me to buy DOCSIS 3 modem before the technician visit for set up. On visit the technician suggested the Netgear modem Docsis 3 was not suitable and suggested me to buy another modem with Wifi networking. He suggested that I use their modem till I replace and then we can set up by phone call to service center.I bought a brand new Arris TG862G modem - same model as the one installed by Comcast technician. On setting up on phone Comcast was not able to get the modem work. They asked us to replace it again. We did that and called again. They still were not able to get it connected after 75 minutes on phone and said they will have to send technician again. Today they informed that there will be a $39 fee to visit as the modem is not owned by Comcast. After making us replace modem 3 times.It looks like it is a deliberate trick by Comcast forcing us to use their modem for which they charge monthly. The customer service today were very rude. On asking them to connect to their supervisor, he flatly refused saying he know his job and there is no option but to pay - almost blackmailing us. As a new customer I am very disillusioned by Comcast, especially the way the customer reps talked today. No wonder they are top of the list in the worst customer service companies."
"Ramesh of Aurora, IL",42213,1,"I had blast for over 2 years. Recently Comcast increased my price to $70 from $40 and told me that my speed is increased to 75 mbps. In reality I was only getting 1.5-2 mbps. I contacted service just to go through the monkey drill of power off, disconnect etc., nothing changed except that the support said sorry and disconnected abruptly."
"doris of Savannah, GA",42213,1,"On the line for five hours, trying to restore cable and internet which were not working when we arrived home this afternoon. Could only reach operators in the Philippines and could not get any help in the US. Transferred many times, left on hold, with no ability to solve our problems. We rely on the internet for our medical record work--we are both doctors. No help was given, and one gentleman I reached did suggest a temporary connection to xfinity hotspot, which is not a secure network. I was told that customer service would call back in 30 minutes. It is two hours later, and of course, no one has called. Why can't they have local US telephone numbers where a customer can call and receive appropriate service?I am lodging a complaint with the FCC, which I believe, will follow up with my concerns. What does a patient do who relies on the internet to send reports back to a doctor or hospital? This service is really an abomination, and the system is very broken. If I treated my patients this way, I wouldn't be in business. How do we reach this monopoly and change their customer service? They must have gotten this message before. What is the problem?"
"ratna of Philadelphia, PA",42212,1,"June 25, after attempt to self connect the internet myself, not working. June 30 I call Comcast. A lady ask me to do phone trouble shooting, still not working, so she said the modem defective, she will send me another one in 3~5 business days. After 1 week did not receive. I call, they said sometimes it takes longer. Another week (so it is 2 week) I called back because still did not receive the modem. The CS said, that he cannot locate any order sent out, so he said there is no modem sent out yet, because he just found the work order. I request to talk to Supervisor. The Supervisor talk to me and give me solution that the next Monday (I called on Saturday), tech will come to my house at 7~8 am. Monday morning my sister in law wait on the sofa next to front door from 6:30 am to 9:30 am, nobody come. She even called me if I give them the right address, I said yes.So when I came home the next Sunday July 26 I called Comcast. She said she only have next appt on August 3. I said I need it earlier because it's more than a month to connect my service and my daughter need to finish her homework on early August. ""And why the tech not come?"" She cannot answer. I ask for Supervisor. The Supervisor need me to review everything of my story again, but he keep cutting the story, and when I ask if the Comcast tech really came to my house that Monday, he answer, ""I cannot say yes or no."" I don't even know what that means so I ask a higher manager to talk, But He (initial D) insist that he is the one who responsible to solve my problem, and refuse to let me talk to someone else. So I said I cannot understand him, and I ask ""should I just close my account?"" He said ""you can do it, if that's what you want to do"" and he said he's going hang up on me because I cannot talk the higher manager. Only they the one who can call me. So he hang up on me. Around 10 minutes later he (initial D) the same person call me back at a more calm voice (he was aggressive on the first call) and said that's the earliest appt he can give to me but he don't even have the early morning. So he even can only give me the next day August the 4th morning and warn me if 7~9 its mean the tech can come at 9 and I have to answer their phone call and that they can finish the job for hours and hours later so I have to be ready to stay home all the hours. Which is mean he warn me I cannot go to work. He keep insist he is in the right position after fail to connect my internet for more than a month.This is a ridiculous situation and not even one word of sorry they said and keep arguing with me after keep breaking all their promise. So watch out customers."
"Ben of Sycamore, IL",42211,1,"Comcast sells different tiers of Internet speed that never as fast as advertised. I pay $85/mo for 75 mbps internet; usually I have 20 mbps, and often only 5 mbps(!). Comcast offers to send a service person out, for a charge, and tells me that ""Internet speeds are not guaranteed."" HOW CAN YOU SELL DIFFERENT SPEEDS THEN? The only way to get their attention is to make a complaint to the FCC (which the FCC recommends)."

I've called once to fix it and will call again. I've also ran speed tests on Internet and I'm only getting 30 mbps... My Internet package is the 50 mbps. Oh yeah... Recently the ceo of Comcast sent a letter congratulating me on receiving their new blast.. Now my Internet will be 75 mbps. What a joke. These ** people are something else.

"Jeffrenia of Phila , PA",42202,1,"My family and I have been customers with Comcast for many years. When Comcast just started, they were a really good company. As years went on, they got worse and worse. They have the WORSE customer service team. Their information is never, ever accurate. Every time you call, they always give you different information. Not one representative never gave me correct info. Their bills are always wrong. They never keep their promises or commitments. They never call back when they say they will. They charge sooo much. Worse of all, they have horrible service. Especially the Internet. I feel like I'm on dial-up."
"Sorrelle of Evanston, IL",42202,1,I called Comcast/Xfinity in the middle of June regarding the slow speed of our internet service. The agent immediately said she would send someone out. SHE DID NOT TELL ME THERE WOULD BE A $70.00 CHARGE. The service person came and told me there wasn't anything he could do. And if I wanted faster speed I should try taking my laptop to the modem and sit next to it! I called to complain when I saw that there was a charge for that visit. The rep said she'd see if they would remove it because I wasn't informed of the charge beforehand. Never heard back. Called back today and was told they'd give me a $20.00 credit and that I'd have to pay the rest. My contract is up in December and I am choosing to end my service with them and get rid of Xfinity altogether! I'll use Roku for everything. Poor Comcast they don't make enough $$$???!!!

Day of installation appointment, they called my wife to say no one was home at 1:14 P.M. The garage door and the front door were WIDE open and clearly visible from the street (50 feet from edge of street). By 1:16 P.M., my wife had given them my number, and they found the time in 2 minutes to call and leave a message saying that I would have to reschedule. I filed a complaint with the BBB. They attempted to contact me after I had previously (7 days earlier) told them to remove my number and email from their database. They still wanted me to establish service with them which would require me to take more time off work (unacceptable) and offered a $25 credit. What an insult. Never doing business with them. EVER."
"Marc of Atlanta, GA",42201,1,"Well, they really have zero workers who have brains. The repair time for their mistakes is always a week out or more.

When I called to cancel I was promised that a service person would show up TODAY 7/15/15 between 8 am and 10 am to remedy the issue. I took the morning off work for this to be done. At 10 am I called Xfinity/Comcast since had not relieved a phone call or seen anyone show up. The customer service rep told me that I have to reschedule because the service guy did not show up!

All it does is keep loading. Small businesses run entire offices off of 1.5-3 Mbps of Internet service, why can't a small family of 3 run the usual technology devices? I call Comcast every few weeks to get assistance with my issue. I spend an hour on the phone and nothing gets resolved. They reset my modem and try to seek me faster internet service which is 50% more than I'm paying now. I have zero options for other internet providers in my area and feel Comcast should be allowed to monopolize the business and continue to provide horrible service."
"Terrence of Pompano Beach, FL",42199,1,"I made a payment extension with Comcast/Xfinity to extend my payment for another week. They told me that they would have to print a ticket for it but my service would not be affected for a whole week. The very next day they shut my service off. I tried to call them to resolve the matter and I was on 30 minute+ wait times. Then it kept disconnecting me every time I entered my information. When I finally got to a live person, she asked for my info then placed me on hold and disconnected me. I called after that and I continued to call afterwards and was disconnected every time. I contacted Comcast by chat and they told me they don't see a ticket that was ever printed and they can't help me. I wonder why in the hell do I even waste my time speaking to customer service and make a payment arrangement if they are incompetent at honoring their agreement on their end. I advise anyone to go to DIRECTV or DISH Network if they can so they won't have to deal with this type of disrespect from a cable company who feels they can treat you any kind of way."
"Sal of Charleston, SC",42199,1,"I called to have a new installation for Xfinity internet. I was scheduled for 6 days later between 3 & 5 pm, what they called ""the guaranteed two-hour window."" On that day no one called and no one showed to do the install. After spending 1 1/2 hours on the phone with them I was finally told no one was available to come that evening and they rescheduled the install ONE WEEK later. After repeated attempts to talk to a supervisor I was finally able to get them to agree to come two days later, but was given a 12-hour window. I had to take off from work. The install was completed at about 7pm and the installer left, but by 7:15 the service no longer worked. I spent another hour and half on the phone trying to get some resolution but I was told I would have to wait another 4 days. The next morning I called and spoke to a supervisor then finally asked to terminate the service. I was transferred to the ""Customer Retention"" department (this took about 45 minutes) who then assured me she could find a solution. She transferred me to a ""specialist"" in Florida who assured and promised me he would resolve the issue. He promised that a technician would call me in an hour. When two hours passed and I had not received a response I called and cancelled the service.In the past I have dealt with Optonline, Verizon and AT&T. Never before had I been so deceived, received such poor service and witnessed such ineptness. Comcast is, without exaggeration, the worst company I have ever dealt with. In the end I lost out on two full days of work, spent a total of nearly 4 hours on the phone, been lied to a total of four times, sat through two missed appointments, and navigated through their phone system dozens of times (which is a barbaric experience).Please note that the individuals who answer the phone are polite and attentive. This is not a criticism of them as individuals, but the company they work for is horrible. They do not care about their customers. They do not have systems in place for situations where things fall apart, and they are cold, impersonal and unresponsive. Do not let their advertising slogans and ads fool you. You will not like working with Comcast. If there are any other services available in your area, choose of them before Comcast! Do not make the mistake of becoming one of their customers."
"nell of West Palm Beach, FL",42199,1,Worst service I've ever had. Our HOA gives us free TV from Comcast so they give us the cheapest internet equipment even when we return it for better equipment. And forget them sending anyone out. But if they do they won't /can't fix problem. Moving to DSL. Might be slower but I might be able to stream a 30 minute show in under 3 hours including interrupted service.
"Faisal of Walnut Creek, CA",42198,1,"This is the worst cable company I've had the displeasure of dealing with and working for at one point. They mislead you with their promos and when you call to complain, you just get the runaround. I hope your stocks plummet!! Billing is always off and support sucks."
"Max of Minneapolis, MN",42198,1,"I have had Comcast for 3 years and over time my internet cost has gone up tremendously. They continued to try to upsale us on cable and finally offered a deal where either our internet and phone would cost more than what we would pay for internet, phone, and cable so I took them up on this. Eventually the cable price went up more and we started at paying 45 dollars a month approximately and ended up around 120. I started getting suspicious as every time I called them they offered me different prices on different things. Finally I decided it was time to remove all services other than internet because the bill was just too high. Every time I said I wanted to remove a service they told me they could discount it and this is after many people had told me the rates they were offering were their lowest rates and I wouldn't find anything lower anywhere else. I realized that the bundled packages aren't actually accurate offers. They tell you how much the internet cost at a higher rate than what they actually will charge you. Then they tell you the phone is only 3 dollars more a month. But if you cancel packaged services it opens up other pricings they won't reveal to you until after your service is cancelled. And even then you have to wait days until that cancellation has taken effect before they reveal the newly available discounted price for single service package.The worst part of all of this is that I was sold a 50 Mbps internet package without being told that in MN the maximum they can offer with that package is 25. They continually told me 50 is not available but then I find out that there is a 50 Mbps package (it is actually 105 but in MN the maximum they give for that package is 50). I didn't even want to start the conversation of requesting a refund for the difference in pricing between what they sold me and what they provided. I did eventually argue with a customer loyalty rep for a while about what pricing options they had available until she agreed to actually look and found the pricing option that I was referring to which she had insisted wasn't available.Their business model is so similar to illegal drugs. Get them hooked on convenience and affordability and then raise the prices and introduce new services at discounted rates only to increase those rates dramatically as well. If you call to cancel your services one at a time you can get the best prices out of them. I am now getting double the internet speed for half the price I was paying. Again straight up misinforming customers about what they are purchasing is my biggest complaint and secondary is their purposeful taking advantage of people who just don't happen to call in to ask if their services are available at lower prices."
"Douglas of Tucson, AZ",42197,4,"Just moved to a new home in Tucson. After being with Cox Cable for years, this location required I have Comcast. I'd read reviews and was concerned. After calling three different times talking with customer service reps and getting three different requirements and prices for bundles etc. Talked with the supervisor and got no relief. I was so frustrated I called home office in Philadelphia and talked with Mike. He listened and repeated back what my concerns were and turned me over to Amanda who also listened carefully and understood my frustration. She had Ben from Portland, Oregon who is charge of Arizona, contact me and he gave me what I needed. Amanda expedited my hook-up and I'm a happy camper. Why did I have to go through all that? More training is needed in Tucson for sure. These three, Mike, Amanda, and Ben more than atoned for my frustrating experience. I'm thrilled thus far with all the services. It's not how you start, but how you finish. Thanks Comcast!"
"Renata of Arlington, VA",42197,1,"This company is the worst. I started with Comcast in May 2014. It started out ok. But then the internet would go off and then I would have to call them to see what was going on. Every time I called I would get a phone call after a week or so and the message would say ""you requested service. If you don't call us back we'll assume you still need the service."" What in the world? I would desperately call back knowing that a service request meant extra charge. I would call and ask ""What is going on? When did I request this service?"" Another time I was moving to a new apartment. I called to request a transfer of the same service with no changes to my new apartment. A lady told me ""yes, yes it will stay intact and the same service will be transferred"".. What a liar! The first month I get a charge that was supposed to be $85 including taxes was $172. I called after opening my bill and the rep tells me. ""oh, yes ma'am, you requested A New Service and therefore you have a new account number""! Upset I hung up the phone, called back. The new rep told me that I didn't request the new service, which that was accurate, ""but the reason you are charged that amount"" he said ""was because when you move, the account changes""? I told him that before moving to the new apartment I called to make sure that the service would stay the same. He said, ""oh no, it never stays the same when a customer moves to another area."" At that point I was so angry. I didn't want anything to do with this company. I spoke to the manager of the condo I'm renting and she said that Comcast is the only internet and cable service available in the units. :( I was so disappointed, I spoke to the Comcast supervisor requesting a service removal for good. He gave me a better price and ""removed"" the mistake, but then again after a month I get another bill for the amount $172. I called back again, the rep would tell me ""it's solved now"". After a month same thing for the amount $162 now. The supervisor again gave me a promotion to have me stay with them and not to remove the service. He said that there was no record of my payments!! Unbelievable! I honestly hope this company goes bankrupt like GM did. I will be so happy when this happens. Today I called again because I got a phone called about 45 minutes ago from a Comcast rep telling me another lie. She said on the message ""hello miss, we have scheduled a technician go see the problem, and if you Don't call us back, we'll assume you still need a technician"". I never requested anyone to come to my home. So I immediately on a Saturday at 8pm when I got this untasteful message, called back and the lady rep tells me, ""Yes, you have a technician scheduled for Monday at 1pm"". First of all that was a lie, and second I would never request anyone on a Monday and much less at 1pm.I honestly need someone to look over the company. Someone has to put a stop to this. This should not be happening in America. Corruption is present in this Comcast company and should be banned. Time Warner Cable has been the best so far, but it's the North. I guess in the South there's always more corruption. Thank you for reading my complaint. I actually give the company -1000 STARS."
"Bryan of Plantation, FL",42196,1,"XFINITY customer service center, thank you for surpassing my expectations today. I had arranged for new 75 mbps Blast! service to be installed today to replace my 18 mbps U-verse Internet (btw 12 mbps taken up by U-verse TV) between 10am and 12 noon, and appreciated the email and calls confirming the time. I was able to rearrange my phone calls and appointments, and put the dog in the crate. Thank you Comcast for respecting my time, the only resource I cannot get back.At 11:53, no one had called or shown up, so as a proactive customer service center you had me call into your 800 number, which asked if I was calling about my installation, and then proceeded to inform me that you were unsure when a technician would arrive, and transferred me to Shandra in customer service. Shandra told me my tech was on the way. In fact, Shandra was so good, that Shy (escapee from Inside Out - and yes that is her name) from the Sacramento OC Dispatcher team called at 12:05 to inform me my tech was running late and would be there in about 20 minutes. At 12:20, because of the proactiveness of Comcast, I called customer service again, figuring that the tech had to take lunch. I mean, no appointments are scheduled between 12-1 according to Comcast and they are subject to hourly wage laws. I spoke to two people including a manager who offered me $20 gift card or 3 months of a premium service for my time. Um, did you see I only have Comcast Internet, not Comcast TV? Oh yes, I was told that unlike Domino's Pizza (yep, Comcast brought up Domino's!!), who can track my pizza to my house, Comcast does not know where their tech's are until they press a button on a phone or laptop. Hello, 2015 calling - if a tech does not enter an update 15 minutes before the next call, perhaps they are going to be late, and you may want to proactively notify the next customer? Comcast mentioned that they were going to be having such a service for customers in the future, so you will now be able to look up where the techs are not supposed to be. I think it will be an Apple Maps program they use to locate their techs.Or just look up Domino's to find your Comcast tech.At 1pm, I called Shy in dispatch because Comcast expects me to follow up with them first when someone does not show up. Shy paused and asked if I had cancelled my service, because the person she had scheduled to show up by 12:20 had a cancelled ticket from me. She apologized and said it was a Comcast issue (be still my heart) and she would arrange a new call between 1pm and 3pm today. At 1:38 Comcast called me (woo hoo! I am special!) and told me the tech would be at my home between 1 and 3pm (it was 1:38pm) and more than likely would be here by 2pm. Are you sensing a pattern? 2:03, let's call Comcast up to see how their automated system is working. Hello ""we are unsure of the arrival time of your tech, please hold for an agent."" John comes on the phone, and he is good, and empathetic, and talks about under committing and over performing. He wants to take ownership of the issues - now someone is talking my language - and will call me back to follow up to see how the installation goes.3pm, who let the dogs out? Me, they were tired of being cramped up. 3:07pm, called Sacramento dispatch to talk to my Pixar friend Shy, no answer went into some IVR hell with options such as ""choose 4 for Not Home Service"". Hung up, called 800 number. My computer friend again said unsure when tech would arrive, passed me to an agent. She is trying to connect me to a supervisor. They are all busy exceeding customer expectations on other calls, and I ask her if she can have an agent call me back. I was in tears, begging, pleading, on my knees - please stop the Xfinity, I mean insanity! She said ""no"", there is no option to have a manager call me back, but they review all these types of cases so they can resolve them and prevent from happening again. I asked her, ""do you resolve these issues without talking or following up with the customer directly?"" And she saidŠ—_ wait for itŠ—_ ""yes"". I asked her ""how can you provide customer service without involving the customer? How do you not have an option to have a manager or supervisor call a customer back?""As I was on the phone with the customer service person the tech showed up. His name is NoName or we can call him Tech 7546. He never introduced himself. As he walked in carrying dirt on his shoes (btw AT&T tech all put on booties over shoes when they come into homes) and smelling of an overflowing ashtray (he does not drive for Uber in his spare time) he said he was from Comcast (thank you!), and then he was on time for his 3pm-5pm appointment. Valerie came home and could not park, because NoName parked in her spot in driveway instead of on street.He was on time! Thank you #Xfinity! I love Comcast for showing up on time 3 hours late. But they continued to exceed my expectations, my pretties! ""Hmm, there is no cable here, you need to have one installed"". ""Yes"", I responded, ""just like the work order I put in requested. Let me show you the attic access I have had cleared out for you all week"". NoName went outside, checked the box, came back with his ladder and more dirt because Comcast wants us to exercise after they leave, thank you for thinking about me. He looks in attic and says, ""I cannot fit in there. We need a smaller tech and it is hot in the attic. I cannot do this job"". NoName is skinnier than me, I can get in the attic, and we had 3 people in there last week cabling electrical and network cables without an issue. NoName leaves, head down, shoulders sunken back to his truck. 10 minutes later, I get a call from Comcast. They are calling me! Publishers Clearing House must be outside! What did I win? ""Hello"", she said, ""we need to reschedule for Saturday. The installation should be done early in morning because it is hot in the attic, in Florida, in the summer, during the day when we do our jobs."" I asked her, ""like between 10 am-12 noon?"" She said ""yes"", but had an 8-9am opening. Oh Joy! Comcast will allow me to wake up earlier to set expectation of not showing up that much better!But I missed John's call. Yes, John who wanted to help and take ownership called me back at 3:26, and apologized for not calling at 3pm. ""I see the tech arrived at 2:45, hope all went well and I will call you back shortly"". 2:45?? Well he is closest to the pin, and he did call back so I give him kudos for doing what he said. So now we wait, I called Executive Customer Relations in Philadelphia, where the difference between normal customer service reps and Executive ones is the Executive team has access to better drugs. They are on morphine and do not have any emotions after dealing with issues like this all day long. She tells me a manager will call me back within 24 hours. I asked her ""24 hours Comcast time?"" There was no response.So now it is Minions time, the Amc 8 Movies Sunrise serves alcohol so it should make the movie even better. At least I will feel better, whilst I dream of little Comcast trucks driving around a neighborhood but never stopping anywhere. And I have XFINITY to thank for showing me how sales and customer service are supposed to work, and exceeding customer expectations. The $20 gift card or 3 months of premium cable service (did I mention I am only an Internet subscriber, not TV?) will go far to recapture the glorious moments of the past 8 hours, as there was the epitome of what a Friday should be."
"rachelle of Wyoming, MI",42196,1,"After having the installation it became clear the salesman had NO working knowledge of technology side of the business. The salesman also gave a quote that was far off. For example, the installation was supposed to be $19.95 (Special promotion, he said), but ended up being $35. Then I was told I could use my own modem (I specifically asked if it would be compatible). He resoundingly said Š—“it would work just fineŠ— -- WRONG! That's another $10, plus tax, a month for the Xfinity/Comcast modem (Or you can purchase one from Best Buy for $200). In addition, there is almost $25 of extra fees/taxes, not including the sales tax! Just ridiculous!I was reassured emphatically that the amount at the bottom of the page was the final charge plus the normal sales tax - the great promotion they had going, he said. THEN to top it all off, when I called and spoke to a sales representative (assuming it was all just a billing mistake), not only did they do NOTHING to fix the bill (in fact the charges were defended), but the woman PURPOSELY gave me the wrong date of 30 new install termination so I would have to pay the $230 early termination fee. Also, shockingly, an hour later my conversation with the sales representative all of our on-demand disappeared -- the system said we were not subscribed -- of which was supposed to be part of the promotion I signed up for... Coincidental? My gut knows better. Comcast is the worst company I have ever dealt with, completely unethical and shady. I am going back to Dish."
"Michael of Brandon, MS",42194,1,"This is the worst service I have ever had. My wifi is always offline when I am at home trying to work, but get up in gone morning at 3am and all is good. Comcast service is the worst I have ever had. You want payment, I want good service."
"karen of Toms River, NJ",42194,1,This has got to be THE WORST internet service EVERRRR. So slow. Have Chromecast and the Movies have to reload every three Minutes (that's being generous). It takes like five to ten Minutes and I have to restart. Takes like three hrs or more to watch a normal length movie. To search the web... also takes more than double time. I usually turn off wifi and just use Sprint which also sucks but NOT AS BAD AS COMCAST!! That's sad. Your internet sucks and cable costs way too much. Unfortunately it's my only choice. Can't wait for fios to be available. :-) :-) :-)
"russell of Modesto, CA",42194,1,"After learning Comcast was the only internet company available in my area I was immediately distraught. I've followed consumer advocate groups as I am picky with who I do business with. I currently have/had DIRECTV which I am happy with but I just needed internet. Went to the Comcast office. They told me I can get 150 mbps internet for $54.99 a month with free cable at $0.00 and HBO. I was fully aware that it was up to me to cancel with 12 month or they will increase my bill automatically which I brought to the rep's attention and she confirmed. Installation would be $67.00. I knew after reading the disclaimer that was a mere estimated quote. Took time off work. Comcast comes out and explains to me what they need to to do get me internet. They would basically need to wire darn near my entire grid on my power line poles some distance away (3 power line poles crossing several private properties). I knew that wouldn't cost $67. No way, considering I'm a supervisor in the maintenance field. I know this game. I get an email about the appointment they made to execute the configuration in the neighborhood. I didn't have time to ask my neighbor's permission for Comcast to access their properties as that's just too much. Directv sent me a modem and it took me 30 mins. to install on my own. That all I wanted. So I call after hours (they claim they are 24 hour service hotline). After I finally get navigate the option to find downgrade or deactivate the automated system tells me something like ""The automated system is currently closed. Call back Mon-Fri 7 AM-7 PM"". Mind you my personal phone number was logged in to their automated system and they knew my account info based on my phone ID. I called while at work just hours before they were to install and each time I called I was immediately directed to a message stating ""The circuits are down. Please call again later"". I called 15 times repeatedly. And lucky me, I have a work phone. I immediately call and guess what, it connects. They didn't have that number on file. Eventually after repeatedly explaining I don't want their service as they continue to attend a reschedule the install, I tell the guy ""Have a good day."" As he is hanging up he says ""Yeah whatever"". And that was my great escape."
"nancy of Downers Grove, IL",42193,1,"For a year, I can't streamline a television program or even play more than one song on Pandora radio, why? My internet speed is too slow to do anything! I have DirecTV on Demand and can't watch anything. Every time I call, the tech person switches me to a different internet channel, which works for less than 24 hours. A woman came to my door advertising the new Comcast fast service so I signed up. They put new cables in the ground. It's worse than dial up from the 90's. My double play bundle is 98.90. This is for one landline and slow internet with BLAST. MY sons tells me it's like the old party lines. They put too many households on the same line. I just called billing and told them I wasn't getting what I'm paying for and he switches me to tech. I had a tech guy out to the house last month. He walked around outside and again switched my channel. My speed went up for 24 hours only then back to the snail's pace. So much for false advertising, soliciting at your door, and getting help. They know what they are doing! After being on hold for 20 minutes I was transferred to a disconnect line and just heard a dial tone."
"Lu of Scotch Plains , NJ",42192,1,"I received the promotion mail from Comcast stating they provides $29.99 per month for 12 month for internet up to 25 Mbps for new customer, expiring July 14th, 2015. I was so excited since I will move in to a new apartment on July 7th, 2015. I have called the number on the promotion letter @ 1024698. After 40 minutes on the phone with one representative (she was trying to get all my information and sell me to the package which I do not need), she told me they cannot offer me the package stated in the letter. Instead, they can offer me $34.99 per month internet with only 3Mbps. I was very frustrated but decided to call the number again (giving them another chance) to talk to another representative hoping he/she treats customer better. I asked him whether he can give me the price as stated in the promotion letter. The answer is straight no with no apology. I told him what I am going to do is not going to be Comcast customer and will write a review. He does not care. Here I am writing the review... Hoping you see it and now understand why Comcast is not a good business and losing its market share: dishonest and not caring their customers at all."
"beego of Awfe, Other",42191,1,"They promise you a certain download and upload speed, and the vast majority of the time it's a fraction of the speed they say it should be. I tried to check my download speed, and the website won't even load. By far, one of the ** companies in the world and I hope Google Fiber starts getting to more cities, because Comcast is ripping us all off of our money and ** us up the ass in the process with their overpriced rates."
"Elizabeth of Fairfield, CA",42190,1,"I recently called to downgrade my service with Comcast because my hours were cut at work. I explained my situation to the Comcast rep who sold me a downgraded package with a cost quote of $110 and told if it didn't work out, I could cancel in 90 days. Well, I got my first online billing (but no actual PDF of the bill) which was $154 not $110 - At the next opportunity I bundled up my equipment and went to my local office to cancel the tv service; however, I was told by the office rep that I only had 30 days to cancel, not 90 and I would have to pay $240 to cancel my service. She refused to cancel my television service but did take my equipment. Now I have no tv, but I'm still being billed because they are refusing to honor the 90 days or to cancel my service. How can they get away with this?"
"Andrew of Toms River , NJ",42188,1,"I have Comcast Service at my home in Florida, as well as in New Jersey. Customer service appears to be outsourced, and attempting to explain a problem appears to ""suffer in translation."" I am now having problems in New Jersey, after attempting to deal with a problem in Florida with minimal success. I cringe at the possibility of having to call a Comcast representative again to resolve a problem. Shame on you, Comcast, I am not impressed that you just got your name atop an iconic building in NYC. You should be focusing your efforts on BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
"Evelyn of Mount Dora, FL",42187,1,"Internet service off and on for last two months as of the 29th of June. No service for 3 days, July 2nd 2014. No realistic eta on resolution. IVR keeps stating a time frame of when services can be up and extending it. Reached out to local office tech supervisor in Lake County with no response. Reps are rude and disrespectful. When asking for a manager they state there is no one available. No one has answers or keeps you informed. Even for a compensation of credit you have to call to inform for it to be documented and then call back when the service is back up to get credit. I have no service and I am treated rudely and unfairly. I am told I have to deal with it and wait without knowing when I will have service. This is not an isolated issue. This is a power failure in my area for the last two months they have not been able to fix."
"d of Boston, MA",42186,1,I have never had a good experience with their customer service. Always long wait times and are never helpful at all. I would never be a customer if I had a choice but they're the only provider in my city. Worst company ever!!!
"lizdaris of Waukegan, IL",42185,3,"I had a previous bill with them and they send me to collections - 1400 dollars. I call and I wanted to have a new account, so they promise me to start me up with a 0 balance. They call me and say ""yes, 0 balance"" 3 times before they then came. I ask again if it was going to be 0 balance, they told me again yes. On the same day of connecting the toll, me: 0 balance. Well when the bill came in it was for $528, so I have call - spend over seven hours on call and now they tell me it was a previous balance that was not paid. I ask them, still no help with this. So why they tell you all this and set you up for failure again?"
"James of Memphis, TN",42185,1,"On June 6, 2015 I called Comcast customer service for help with internet service. At the end of the call, the CSR who gave her name as **, gave me a sales pitch. ** told me I get increase my internet speed for only $7.00 per month, and it was a 30 day trial period during which time I could cancel at any time and not be charged. I asked ** at least five times if it was only $7.00 per month and that I could cancel at any time and not be charged. She said yes. I was also told I would not be charged the $7.00 until the end of the 30 day trial period. I said OK.On June 16, 2015 I went online to look at my Comcast internet data usage for the month, and found that my bill had increased by $17.00. I called Comcast customer service - billing - and spoke to **. ** told me part of my increased bill was due to Comcast price increases that go into effect on July 1, 2015. ** told me that $11.42 would be removed from my bill and that she has no idea why ** told me a $7.00 price. I told ** I wanted to go back to the exact service I had. ** assured me she would take care of it.On June 20, 2015 I went online and Comcast still had not corrected my bill. I called Comcast billing yet again, and spoke to **. ** said it was in the system to remove $11.42 from my bill, and ** assured me it would be taken care of. On June 30, 2015 my bill still has not been resolved. My bill has never been paid late. My bill is due tomorrow. How can any company be so incompetent? I really don't think they care. I am getting ready to switch to DIRECTV for TV, and AT&T for internet service."
"April of Hudsonville, MI",42185,1,This is absolutely the worst company I have ever dealt with. I spent 4 hours trying to resolve an issue. In the process was told that my banking information that I gave to a phone rep was never received but that I should trust them with it again. I was talked down to numerous times by a manager. I missed family time to try to resolve this and at the end of the night I have no resolution and I had 2 hours of chat transcripts of me going in circles. One rep actually tried to contact the department that I was trying to get a hold of and ran into the same situation of being in the queue for 20 min and then kicked to a random voicemail due to waiting too long. This is ridiculous.
"Chris of Dallas, GA",42184,1,"In May 2015 I agreed to upgrade to the X1 platform at the rate of 159.49, with no contract. Since the upgrade my bill has never been the correct amount. It has gone up. Also since installation the service has never fully worked. It will freeze up and black out. Some of these have been due to Comcast working in the area and others there has been no explanation. I have had to switch my modem out once already which has not fixed the problem of it not assigning the correct IP. I have tried several times to talk to someone using the 800 Comcast number but get bounced around departments or told that there is nothing they can do. I am at the point to disconnect all my services and find another option due to the utter lack of ownership of the problems I have had. I tried to have a technician come out and check the original install of the X1 and was told that they cannot schedule techs during an outage and that I would have to call back later. This is ridiculous. I would like to speak to someone who can actually fix my problem without bouncing me to another department where I have to start over from the start. But I am not sure that there is anyone who cares about the customer more than they due the money."
"Sallyann of Peabody, MA",42184,1,"I ""updated"" to Comcast blast about a month ago. Since then my WiFi is at a CRAWL and that is saying it nicely. There is no way I am getting the promised speed. Dial up was faster and of course, no answer from Comcast. As soon as I figure another service out this company is out for me. They should be sued for false advertisement."
"Christina of Murfreesboro, TN",42183,1,"My husband and I are paying $30 more a month now that our 1 year agreement is up & because I won't sign up for a 1 year contract it will be $30 more each month. This is the only service for internet in our area and it has been the worst service I have ever dealt with. It interrupts what I am doing every few minutes to tell me that the Ethernet has stopped working and needs to find the problem, or the internet freezes and I always have to reboot the computer. I am done with Comcast and I will make sure not to move in an area where I have to use this service again!! Comcast, if you want to keep your customers satisfied, lower your rates because the way things are going these days people are taking different approaches to watch tv and fix the internet problems."
"Sameer of Bloomington, IL",42182,1,When we moved to another address we closed the Comcast account and our online access to our account was ceased. They didn't even send paper bills and we were charged with late payment unnecessarily. Not going to use Comcast services again in my life.
"adena of Bryn Mawr, PA",42181,1,"I have been having problems with Comcast on demand for a long time. Items scroll and literally choose themselves. I have looked at programs to watch, and it will buy the item just by clicking info on it. I let most of this go. I have even paid for programs I did not order on occasion because customer service is so difficult to deal with. Last evening I tried watching a video and it came up that I needed to contact CS for billing. This was midnight. If you call the number they give you on the screen, you are told it is not during business hours and you need to call back. If you go through the entire menu and push other areas, having to do with paying your bill, all of a sudden there is a live person to talk to. I will not make any politically incorrect statements but CS reps are unable to speak clearly. Do not know the language. The first person verified me quickly, told me I had reached my video credit for the month! And needed to put in for EXTRA video credit for me! He hung up on me after I was put on hold for 10 mins. I called back and as the rep who answered began I could hear this other person in the background talking! I told her what happened, and all of a sudden she said I was not a verified user on the account! I have always been for 12 years. She insisted I wasn't. I asked for a supervisor. He got on after 15 mins and said I wasn't a verified user. Both reps told me I could go fly a kite pretty much for all they care. Today, I called to find out what the issue was, and lo and behold, I am of course a verified user, and it seems there are tons of orders for a program we never ordered, but they insisted we did. Comcast used to be wonderful. It's horrible now."
"Nicholas of Lynchburg, VA",42181,1,"If I could choose lower than one star I would. Absolute worst internet I have ever had. One minute it works fine then next it doesn't work at all. Every morning doesn't work, sometimes loads up to 50% then stops. Apartments need new choices besides Comcast."
"Greg of Auburn, WA",42181,1,"I've been complaining for months about slow internet around 1 to 5 mbps and not able to open emails half the time. Finally they agreed to send someone out after I went and got another modem from Comcast and bought a new wifi router and still no improvement. The day before they came out, I was getting 3.34. The day they sent a tech, I was getting 25 to 60 mbps. I have a history on my speed tests every month for years, and they haven't had that speed for over 6 months, except the day the tech came out. They have been throttling my account. It's so wrong!!!"
"SS of Smyrna, TN",42180,1,Although we are writing here but there will be no effect. Comcast connection is very poor. Wifi always loses connection. Planning to move to AT&T.
"Nickolas of Brandon, MS",42179,1,"Alright so for starters, I have 50 mbps down. I just replaced my router I think for the 5th time in a 1 year span. Still the same ** issue. I am getting 2-5 mbps with a few bursts of 40 mbps. These bursts last for about 10 seconds. I have an idea for Comcast. They should rename their company to Shitcast, maybe then people would not be so pissed about their ** service. Their ""Award winning customer support"" is all but that. The people on the line do not understand half the ** of what they are supposed to. When I am trying to do some things sometimes I will lose connection. Their customer support is god awful, and their servers double that. Whatever you do go with anyone but Comcast. Hell you prob will get more speed from DSL than Comcast Cable."
"Sonya of Atlanta, GA",42179,1,"I called Comcast about why my internet bill has increased $250.00 each month. Internet. When I signed up for Comcast I was told my bill would not exceed a certain amount. And so I agreed. But each month my bill is higher than the amount. One representative noticed my GB were lower than they should be. When instructed to phone the Internet Customer Security Assurance Department, after holding for over an hour or more, I was informed that the rep was incorrect in telling me that my usage was capped incorrectly.And furthermore I was told that in my area, Comcast only offers a certain amount of 300 GB. On the online image of my account it stated 250 GB are what I'm presently receiving. I'm told by Comcast that my usage exceeds 1000 GB. But Comcast does not know why. I followed all Comcast steps and still my usage exceeds. This practice is unfair practices to customers. Comcast has the authority to charge overage fees but has no way of knowing how you are going over. Comcast should not charge until Comcast can show what exactly they are charging."
"Christian of Houston , TX",42178,1,"Do not get Comcast. They--this business is not recommendable, the internet is poor poor poor, channels are horrible, options and price is way too high. Be aware of this big American scam!"
"Deepak of Atlanta, GA",42178,1,"I have been facing extremely slow internet connection and frequent disconnections for the last two and a half months. I have spent at least 10 hrs on the call to their customer care. Three technician visits and one scheduled, the trouble with service continues. Since I didn't get any internet they promised to compensate for the time and here they start malpractices as I should put it. Compensation did show up on the online account so I didn't pay anything for that month and I was at least relieved. But when I was to pay this monthŠ—Ès bill everything from the last month appeared back and an additional 70$ charge was mentioned for technicians visit.I did what any troubled consumer would do, I called their billing department. What happened on the call was shocking least to say. The lady on the phone kept on reading from the present bill and was absolutely deceitful & impolite. She kept on heckling me throughout the call and was venting spleen. After 45 minutes of discussion she offered me to take out the technician fee and told me to pay for rest of the bill even for the time when I couldn't use the internet.The conclusion is, cheating the consumer is not going to fructify and with a bitter heart I am saying that if you can't provide the services and solutions then don't promise to your customer. You exist because we are using your services. The day we decide to move away you will cease to exist. I leave the decision to the readers of this review to decide for themselves whether to back the unethical practices."
"Bradach of Marianna, FL",42178,1,"Comcast is throttling customers internet speeds down by ridiculous proportions. I remember the day I signed up the speed they sold me was 25 mbps. They later made me happy when I got a letter in the mail informing me that my speeds were increasing to 50 mbps for no additional charge. What happened next shocked me when my speeds decreased to 3 mbps download speed. They told me that's what I was supposed to get, but they didn't know I was an I.T. Comcast is trying to pull a fast one of epic proportions. They are bringing us back to years to early DSL speeds. What they are doing should not be tolerated, and someone needs to do something about it."
"A. of Manchester, NH",42177,4,"Comcast seems to get a lot of hate, but I have never had an issue with them. I've been a customer on and off for the past 12 years, and my parents were customers before that. My spouse was in the Army so we moved every 9-36 months. We got Comcast for our internet (and sometimes cable and phone) whenever we were in an area that Comcast offered service. Every charge was explained beforehand. Any service issues were fixed within 3 days (usually within hours or even minutes). Customer service representatives were always easy-to-understand and helpful. Internet speeds are decent (I can browse the internet, have the kids watch Netflix, and my husband and his friend can World of Warcraft on 2 different devices, all at the same time with no issues.)Installation is cheaper than some other companies (we can choose to do it ourselves and skip the fees). They are military-friendly. We have had to cut our contract short a few times due to unexpected (less than a month's notice) moves, and we were never charged a fee. They even offer services/bundles without a contract, so there is no cancellation fee. When we last had to move unexpectedly a few months ago, we were even able to get our Comcast Xfinity Internet and Cable switched the same day! Comcast isn't perfect, but in my experience, I (luckily) haven't had any serious issues."
"Carla of Gadsden, AL",42177,1,"I have called Comcast no less than 50 times over the last two months with the same problem. For no apparent reason, the internet modem will reset when a new device attached. After several attempts to watch this pattern, I begin to feel that this is an internal policy that is not disclosed to the public. I am now prepared to start a class action lawsuit to settle my complaints and go public with my assumptions. I ask Comcast to step to the plate now before it gets really bad. I have lost rapport with my customers because I am unable to connect to the internet 75% of any day. I have lost money because of losing rapport. My business has suffered. No I don't have business class as I do not operate a large business, but I expect to be able to access service at least 75% of the time I am forced to pay for it. I am so angry, I am having health issues."
"Josh of Corvallis, OR",42175,1,"Since I have had Comcast, I have hated this company. Prices are ridiculous and speeds are not as promised. They use speed throttling to fool speed tests, but actual internet speeds are not close to what was promised or what speed tests show them to be. My internet constantly goes out/down, wi-fi only works part of the time, prices keep going up constantly, and they get away with all of it because there is no other competition in this area. I created this account just to leave this review and was not surprised to see that there were hundreds more like me on this site. As soon as I find any other high speed provider, Comcast will never see or hear from me again."
"naveen of Richfield, MN",42175,2,"I have a Comcast xfinity internet account and I moved from one apartment to another and called Comcast customer support and informed then about the move and they said all set to go. And I asked her, ""Do I need to do anything on your site,"" she replied not required. And I have not received any email about my past due amount which is $78.80 except all promotional emails. Now a Debt collector emailed me about the due amount and I don't know whether it will be reported to credit agencies and It will affect my credit score. I called Comcast after receiving this letter and they said I need to enter my new account number to see my updated due amount. I logging using my user name and password and I called Comcast reported about my new move but they have not updated that account under my name and not even sent me any email about my payment not because of this I'm affected because of $78 amount. My credit report will have a collection account and I don't know that I have to update my account number. I will assume any system will update it when I called and reported it. This is bad experience even after paying all the required amount. I paid that amount to debt collector."
"!@#$ of Baytown, TX",42174,1,Comcast is the ** internet service I ever had in my life. When I started with them it was $30 for 25mbps. Now it's $35 for 6 ** Mbps. Now I pay $66 dollar for 25 Mbps. Still I cannot watch any online videos at night without buffering. This ** Comcast is the only internet service in my city - that is the only reason I still use these ** internet service.
"Ron of Brier, WA",42173,5,"Comcast has not provided the service they promise. I purchased a 100mb/sec internet plan and have not received consistent service since going with Comcast in 2008. Constant data hits (which they can't seem to detect) and, when calling to find out what the problem is, their response: ""We don't see any problems from our end."" ""We can send a technician out, but you'll be charged a service fee if a problem is not found"". Well, of course they aren't going to find a problem, because the problem is on their end. They oversell their servers and their data transmission lines become inundated and the flow is inhibited. Comcast relieves themselves of this responsibility because they use third party resources as a transfer medium. I am done with Comcast and will NEVER go back. I'll pay my 211.00 early termination fee, turn their box back in and be done."
"Federico of Chicago, IL",42173,1,"Comcast charged me for the Mayweather-Pacquiao Fight that did not play. They claimed that shows up in their system as the event did play for 54 minutes, when in fact it did not. I have an SD box so I ordered it on the phone in Standard Definition and they charged me for HD. They said that in their system shows up as if I ordered from the box in HD. The fact is that I could not play the fight. When I try to call, the lines were super busy because apparently million of people were having the same issue. I've waited on the lines for approximately hour and a half and finally gave up and hang up. The charge did not show up in my account online, so I assumed I was not going to be charged with all that fuzz going on. And of course I forgot about it because believe it or not some people do have to work for a living and can not be on the phone all day and make our lives about Comcast.Of course a month later the $99 dollars show up on my account and when I called they said it was too late, that I should have call earlier. When I said that I call that same day, they said that I should have call the next day. I tried to explain that I can not make my life about them, but that did not help. I spoke to a guy in Spanish and he escalated the claim saying that by mistake the show was provided in HD and that couldn't be played it on a SD box. Of course a week later the charge was still on my account. When I called they said that my claim was denied by their credit department (Of course they did not bother notifying me). And the new representative told me that despite the fact it was in HD my box can play it anyway. Of course I'm technically savvy and I'm telling you the pay-per-view did not play in the 810 channel they claimed.Under pressure he gave me the option to discount $25 dollars that that's the only thing I'm ever going to get. And of course after having fought with 3 reps I was emotionally exhausted and finally gave up I took the $25 discount because it was not worth my emotional health and my time to keep fighting for $99 dollars. Of course by giving me those $25 dollars under cohesion they protect themselves from further claims I suppose. But regardless I feel this is a great injustice, especially after giving Comcast thousands upon thousands of dollars and they do not have any client consideration. And of course because they are a monopoly I can't cancel their service, because they are the only ISP in my area. So the multi-billion dollars company managed to get away and steel $99 dollars from my account."
"Grace of Albuquerque , NM",42173,1,"I went into the local Comcast store and wanted to cancel my service because my health has deteriorated in the last couple years. Upon dealing with 3 different people, I was then directed to the person at the last stop to wring me out on why not to cancel my service with them. I explained I have been placed on a limited income due to my health, and could not afford the service at the price I had been paying. The young lady said, ""Oh I will get you fixed up and you can have better, faster service at a better price."" ""What? Really? Ok, are you sure?"" ""Yes, and it will not ever go up!""Three months later I pull a letter out of the mailbox that says, we are so sorry, we have made a mistake and the price will now be 10.00 more a month starting next month. We did not charge you for the modem. So, I called and explained the arrangement of my monthly payment and was told after climbing up the ""chain"" of professional bargainers that we are truly sorry, but you have to pay the 10.00 because of our error. I believe the large civil lawsuit that was filed against Comcast in Philadelphia that states Comcast will pay out $16.67 million in cash for overcharging customers, should have been an idea to let's do things right the first time. Guess they didn't learn a thing? Please Comcast, don't tell me that you're sorry, and can't do a thing about it and that I can pay or change my service. I paid you an installation fee and 3 months of service for which I was promised a faster speed internet of 50 mgb not the 12 I was getting. I can't even get my apps to download and play without interference every single time. I wish that large billion dollar corporations would just stop the bargains and give me a set price. If I can't afford it, I will go someplace else. Don't candy coat the deal and then say, aww, oops, sorry. How many others got this letter here in Albuquerque, NM hmmm? Stop playing games with your customers. It's wrong and illegal, remember? Very Angry."
"Maria of Kennesaw, GA",42172,1,"So, I was a loyal Comcast customer for over 10 years, beginning in 2000. Then, I started having trouble with some of my services and decided to give AT&T U-Verse a shot, since they finally showed up in my community. Loved it, loved them, and loved their consistent attention and care for their customers not to say they don't have issues at times, but they handle things so very well that they make you feel bad for even bringing it up. That said I had to move, just up the street to a new community, and I am being forced to use Comcast (Bulk services?). I upgraded to the triple play back on the 5th of June, and was told that the equipment would be delivered within 3-5 business days. Great. Fantastic. On the 10th I called just to see where things were, to ask when I might be receiving my equipment, and was told that the order was still sitting in their system with a ""pending"" status, so had never been forwarded to the warehouse that ships the equipment. I asked how that could possibly have happened, and I also asked what would have been the outcome had I not called to check. Dude said, ""No one would have known if you had not called"" What?! So I said, ""Alrighty then. Let's get that fixed -- and by the way can you send that to me fast-tracked, since I am now without TV, Internet, or phone?"" He said, ""No problem. Just one thing though, you're gonna need to pay $29 for the quicker shipment."" At that point I was so frustrated that I just said whatever and he said they would ""share"" the cost with me. You know, like it was MY fault that they didn't do their jobs correctly the first time. Fine. On the 15th, still no equipment. Third call. ""Oh, wait. We just now sent that package out to you and we don't have any actual tracking information to help determine when you will actually get the package. Could be tomorrow, could be a couple of days after that."" Package showed up on the 16th. But wait, there were only two of the four pieces of equipment I was expecting. Fourth call. Rep says, ""Your account activity actually shows that it's been cancelled...and it looks like prior to the cancellation, there were only two pieces of equipment ordered."" What?! Yep...four reps and two supervisors later, I am being told that I now have to wait for a call tomorrow (18th) for the account to be straightened out and if I try to make any changes to the account (since none of the reps actually got my itemization correct), then ""the audit department would make it so that NO SERVICES would be connected at my location"" What?! The last rep I spoke to acted as if I had called back all those times to make changes to my order, when in fact, each time I called back -- BECAUSE OF THEIR TOTAL AND COMPLETE LACK OF COMPETENCE -- I had them read back to me what was shown in the order and IT WAS NEVER CORRECT. How is that my fault? These folks really don't give a crap about customer service or just plain SERVICE for that matter. I just don't get how they can all be so callous regarding how they affect our lives. I know they have a ton of customers, and I know they have it so that you are basically stuck in certain situations or areas; however, know this...depending on where you live, work, & play, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE THEM AT ALL. I have the option to split up my services and only take the Basic/Expanded that the complex forces us to use and I will use another company for my internet and phone. ANY OTHER COMPANY. Almost everything you watch on Cable can now be accessed through the internet and all sorts of apps. Hulu Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Go, etc., are now viable options to completely do away with cable. Comcast has basically ensured that I will now be one of the loudest voices in the ""down-with-Comcast"" arena. My puny little dollars may not make a big difference to them but by God, I will spend the rest of my days trying to convert as many folks as I can reach. They are ridiculous. THEY NEED TO TRAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES TO ACTUALLY KNOW THEIR PRODUCT AND TO ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS ON THE OTHER END OF THE DOLLARS THEY COLLECT EVERY DANG MONTH!"
"wilson of Douglasville, GA",42172,3,"Service was disconnected for nonpayment. Death in the family caused unexpected financial problems. 2 weeks later, a rep left a note to get the equipment! I plan to pay the bill in july... this is June. Called and waited 1 hr. No answer. Why the rep??"
"S. of Sacramento, CA",42171,1,"This is a 3 story residence, with extremely light internet activity, but I have experienced NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS with Comcast! I went to the extreme of paying an additional $12 a month to boost my internet speed, with absolutely NO positive changes or results. Furthermore...and mark my words: there is no solution. No matter how much money you pay to correct this - no matter how many calls you make to reset your modem (which I pay EXTRA for Comcast to provide) - NOTHING will make this situation better. The internet connection is so pathetic I OFTEN cannot even download a browser connection. Think twice before paying for their services! To be perfectly honest, I have spoken to some extremely accommodating representatives who have tried their damnedest to help me - but no matter how many amazing friendly representatives you reach, nothing, absolutely NOTHING resolves my issues with high speed internet. Think twice! I tell ya."
"KENNETH of Montgomery Village , MD",42170,1,"Every day I have problems with my internet and home phone. I go on Youtube and it stops working, keeps breaking up two to five minutes to get on a site. Comcast cable has been out to my house so many times I can't remember. It took three or four Comcast repairmen to fix my phone. The last one one minute fixed because none of them know what they are doing. They need to be certified. Three times they told I need a new phone. Anyway where I live the service sucks."
"Peggy of Centennial , CO",42169,1,"I added internet service to my Comcast service. It's been a month & 90% of the time I try to access the internet, I have to either reset my modem or call them to fix the connection. THIS is a such a rip off. Unfortunately, I didn't cancel in time to not be binding in a contract for 2 yrs."
"Bill of Joelton, TN",42168,1,"I tried to reach Comcast customer support because my data usage has gone through the roof for no apparent reason. By phone: I called the support number on the website. Support said for data usage issues I should press 1. I pressed 1. Then I was offered two options that would not have helped me. I did nothing. Comcast hung up. I tried the same scenario again, with the same result. By phone again: This time I called and did not press 1. That led to more options, none of which related to my issue. I pressed nothing, and Comcast hung up. By chat: I got just a few lines into a chat, and the chat window froze. End of short discussion. By email: Then I chose the email option for support. Over 12 hours later, no response.By chat again: So I tried chat again, just now, because this extreme data usage (287GB in just 12 days) will end up costing me big overage fees. This time I was able to have a conversation, be it at a slow pace. And I had to repeat my main question to finally get the answer that, ""No, there isn't a way to monitor hour-to-hour usage"" to try to troubleshoot what is causing the problem. At some point, I finally had to end the chat because I did not anticipate it taking so long. Before I had to leave the chat, I asked the support agent to send me any other suggestions or information. When I was able to return to the computer, the chat window was closed (no final message), and I have received no email, either.Priority zero: Comcast's customer service boss says we customers are priority one. I think he missed it by one digit. Now I have a choice to unplug internet until I find a solution or a new ISP... OR continue to rely on internet service and end up with usage three times the normal and costing probably $60 to $70 in overage charges this month."
"Sharon of Lake Worth , FL",42167,1,This is the first time writing a review about any company. I was having issues with connecting to my interest and had to call 5 times before giving up. 3 of their reps hung up on me and the other two transfer me to other department. I hate Comcast!!
"Dylan of Atlanta, GA",42167,1,"For anyone who wants a good laugh please read. There are many things that are common complaints made by customers, like taking hours on the phone, or bait and switch pricing, or never getting an issue fixed. And we know Comcast knows, but they never admit it. Until today. Today, I called Comcast, because I'm in my 12 month promotional period and my price keeps getting increased. Below is what I learned.My bill is in two parts, one part is promotional and has not increased, the second non-promotional part was increased. I was told this meant they were maintaining the promotional price. Comcast told me they had no power to change my price back, because it was set by the system. I asked to speak to the person in the company who sets prices. I was told that there is NO Comcast employee who sets prices, but that they're system generated.After, finding out the above, I came to the obvious conclusion that the sales people offer promotional prices, with no intention of the customer keeping them. After all, it is literally impossible for Comcast to maintain that price, because the computer can change prices at will, and no one in the company can undo it. To check my reasoning, I asked the Comcast employee on the line this same question who confirmed it. I explained the above and asked, ""So I was offered a promotional price and Comcast had no intention of giving me that price."" She said, ""That is correct.""I suggested just taking $X dollars off my price. I was told that wasn't an option for a price in the system. I then asked to speak to their IT group to get that fixed for her. She happily said, ""yes, of course."" (I then asked her not to connect me. That would be worthless). Even better, Comcast has this recorded. I'd love to see how their leadership responds to knowing that their phones reps are telling customers that all their marketing is just a bait and switch scam."
"maria of Bradenton, FL",42167,1,"I contact both providers the same day to request an estimate. Both of them asked for my credit card #. They assure me it's only to make a computer to process the request & give the best rate. Well, a few days later, they both charge my credit card. I called them & finally they credit me. The worst was Xfinity. They claimed they cannot find me??? So I have to ask my credit card to stop payment."
"LISA of York, PA",42165,1,I needed a new on demand box. Tried to order over the phone. I received 2 remotes which was not even the correct address. Tried calling again. This time I received 1 remote. Still no box. Ok off to the local Comcast office. After half hour in line I finally received my box but found out they changed our billing address to our vacation home address. They can't fix in office. Back to the phone. Took the box home and tried to hook up. They now tell me there are no such numbers. They are because they are on the back of their box no receipt. No appointment in days. Someone help me of this poor pathetic company!
"Emma of Pembroke Pines, FL",42164,1,"First, I updated the internet to Business, expecting to have a faster speed. Nothing has change but the bill, yes went up very high. The home phone was added to the business and have it back to the residential took me 2 months and several calls. Finally I have it back, but they gave me a temporary number while they make the changes. Guess what? When I make phone calls, the number that appears in the callers ID's is not mine - is the temporary one. Usually my bank pay my bills, but this month I check the Comcast bill and noticed charges for services that I never asked for. They keep billing me for the internet besides the bill I pay for the Business. Double charges. This is the worst company I ever had. Thinking in change to another internet provider."
"Rasim of Woodbridge, VA",42163,1,"It is so Shaming. I was about to go with Verizon for my business with one phone line and internet they were offering me 112$ month to month. Just called to ask the price from Comcast the guy there told me that taxes in Verizon are high and Comcast is the best. I have signed my lease for business which I closed for a year but Comcast without telling me signed me up for 3 years. The person on the phone never told me that I am going to have Comcast in next 3 years even though I had my lease for one year. I called to customer service to cancel it and found out that I am stuck with them and the worst part is they don't let me go out of contract without signing the paper that I am going to pay them 75% of left contract. I have taken Contracts law and never saw similar type of contract when one party tries to go out of contract he can not. This is my civil right to break the contract. and by contract law the damage I caused I might be paying but in this case the damage for Comcast will be 120$ 10 $ a month discount that they gave me. So instead of paying 120$ more a year they now inducing me to pay 75 %, ridiculous. I have contacted to Comcast several times , asked the supervisor they told me they are going to call me and I have never received a call. Last time when I talked to representative in Comcast I asked her to give me in writing that somebody is going to call me but I have never heard anything. Comcast thinks That I am going to pay them, No I will wait till you take me to court where you will definitely loose."
"Jane of North Port, FL",42163,1,"I tried contacting Comcast/Xfinity's service phone number. The person who answered was unable to help and when I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told the wait time was 10 minutes. In the meantime I asked to speak to someone in the United States. He said he would give me the number of someone the the US (in other words, Comcast outsources their employees). When I called, it was the same recording! I called the first number back, and asked the gentleman with the thick accent where he was located. He hung up on me!"
"Michael of Annapolis, MD",42163,1,"From the first day, our experience with Comcast has been terrible. The first installer was hours late. He did a sloppy installation, leaving a giant coil of cable and not installing connectors correctly. The second technician said the first was a contractor and ""that happens"" - as if that should excuse it. Since then there have been non-stop problems with the set top boxes and the network/phone interface. Other Comcast Voice customers often can't hear our voice when we call. One of our four setup boxes malfunction or lock up on the average - approximately once per week. Solution from customer service rep every time we call in after waiting 10 to 20 minutes on hold - unplug, reboot, and wait 5 minutes for the defective box to restart. We have had the service for 9 months. It was bad as ever. I recently turned off the WiFi portion of the cable modem and installed an external unit that I bought because the Comcast WiFi kept going up and down all the time. I am looking at ways of trimming back on Comcast triple-play bundle services and substituting other vendors until our 2 year contract is up. Never again!! "
"Thor of St. Paul, MN",42162,1,"I was not home when the Comcast Tech comes to install internet service for my new house. I have an antenna cable connected from the outside box to a three-way splitter in the basement to my living room, family room and new bed room in the basement. I drew a diagram for my wife to give to the tech to follow. I wanted to make sure he just install a new cable for the internet to the living room. The tech cut my antenna connection outside, and all my connections in the basement, and took my splitter. Already filed a complaint and requested Comcast to fix that back in place."
"G of Burien, WA",42162,1,"This company is garbage and they know it. They provide the minimum in order to get subscriptions and they charge out the ass. I have had internet on and off for the last few months and every time I call them about it, somehow it becomes an issue with my equipment. They then threaten you with a fee if they find out that their equipment attached to your building is not at fault. I have changed my router and modem twice, I know it is not my equipment, it is their service. All you will get is excuse after excuse from them. If they did not have the monopoly they would never exist."
"Gloria of Conshohocken, PA",42161,1,"I moved to a new apt and - even though I have FIOS -- Xfinity pop up asking me to sign up. Continues to pop up and pop up. I clicked on the ""manage my preferences"" click and opted out. But Nooooo. A day later, there it is. Same laptop, same email address. I called and called and got an alternate # to call. After hold for 20 minutes, it hung up on me. What can I do?"
"BARB of Castle Rock, CO",42160,1,"I have been a long time customer with Comcast - 11+ years at one location. Overall my service with them has been great! Their Customer Service Department has always been helpful and would ""talk me off the ledge"" whenever I was upset (which was not often) - UNTIL NOW! Several weeks ago I called them to just ""inquire"" about the cost of a popular fight that my boyfriend wanted to order (Note: I was just ""inquiring on the fee not to order). During this call the young lady mentioned she could LOWER my bill by offering me this ""new technology DVR"". I am not a technical person but always interested in lowering my bill if the service would not change - only would improve! She ""assured"" me it would go from $143/month down to $121/month. She did not inform me of any install fees or equipment fees. She said it would just be less with better technology. I agreed and scheduled a time for a Technician to come and install it.A Contract Working (very nice young man) arrived and installed the new DVR. I was impressed with all the features and I was excited about all of its features. (record 4 shows at one time as opposed to just two). After he left on that Saturday morning it was great for less than 24 hours. I was having to unplug the DVR to ""reboot"" the system, wait 10 minutes for it to reconnect. Sometimes this would work - other times not all. I would go several hours without any service and was forced to watch a small t.v. in my bedroom and forced to watch commercials! And now it doesn't work at all during the evening. :-( Also, the internet is running very poorly now as well, takes anywhere from a minimum of 5 minutes to as long as 12 minutes to connect. I've never had such poor service with Comcast. Horrible!!I have spent most of my evenings talking/complaining to Comcast. I have had a technician come out to rectify the problem. He spent a half hour fixing connections in my walls. That seemed to work for about a day. I then got my first bill. What a nightmare experience that was. The bill was for $355. I immediately got on the phone with Comcast to have that error rectified. The original call I made to just ""inquire"" about the cost of the fight - the woman from Comcast scheduled the fight on my bill. She also loaded me up with Triple Play (DVR, internet, and phone). I do not even own a home phone line. Ugh! I also had installation charges and fees that were never explained to me. After 2.5 hours of talking to Comcast Supervisors they were able to ""talk me off the cliff"". All the charges were waived - including a $70 fee to send a Technician to my house to fix this DVR issue - which this fee was NEVER explained to me either. This is Comcast equipment that has never worked correctly and they are CHARGING the consumer to make it right. What??? After much energy and time they lowered my bill below $100 and gave me three movie channels and they guaranteed me that my bill will remain at this rate for two years. After three weeks of virtually no service, after nightly phone calls to Comcast, after scheduling another Technician to come out to see if they can rectify this ongoing issue I have decided it is not worth it any longer. I want my old DVR back. Now they tell me that they are phasing out the old Legacy DVR - we will all be forced to use this new technology that doesn't work. I will be leaving Comcast soon!"
"Jan of Chicago, IL",42160,1,"I moved to another unit within the same building. I made a moving request online on May 30th. The system gave me 4th of June as a re-connection date. It also gave me a confirmation page and a confirmation number **. It was also written that I was going to get contacted in 24 hours. No one contacted me. I waited for 4 days without internet and today (June 4th) called the number written on my confirmation page. The representative I talked with told me that there is no moving requests in their system. When I asked why I have a confirmation number the answer was ""I don't know"". He wanted me to make another moving request online. I did and it gives me June 10th for the re-connection date! Is this some kind of joke? Now I have to wait 6 more days without internet? And Comcast going to charge me 60 dollars for the month of June when I don't have the service for one third of the month just because they can't move my service to a different unit in the same building? I don't understand why when you start the service it starts the same day, right away but when you want to move it it takes 5 days???"
"Josh of West Valley City, UT",42158,1,Comcast is the worst company I have had the opportunity to deal with. I have called to disconnect my account with them several times over the past few months and still charged me for services I didn't use. I have had dishNET since December but Comcast charged me until February! It's Crap and that company should be brought down for fraud!
"Dave of Lambertville, NJ",42157,1,"My daughter had an appointment with a Comcast for an install on Friday May 29th. The tech showed up was incompetent and said that someone would be out Monday to fix the problem. The tech showed up Monday called the wrong phone number when he arrived BUT was given the correct number to call. HE DIDN'T BOTHER TO CALL THAT NUMBER HE JUST LEFT. When she called Comcast they said someone would be there Friday a whole week after it was supposed to be done. After 6 hours on the phone with this poor excuse for a company speaking to at least 8 different minions, she was promised someone would be there the next day (Tuesday) at 3 pm. 3 pm came and went. Again she called they told her someone be there Monday the 8th of June. What happened to 3 pm or even Friday. Again several phone calls to Comcast with no resolution. All they could say is ""we are sorry for the inconvenience."" Nothing about fixing the problem. This is the poorest excuse for a company I've ever seen. When is someone going to do something about this! My daughter is studying for the CPA exam and has no internet service to use."
"sharon of North Charleston, SC",42157,1,"I have been a Comcast customer over 20 years and satisfied with the service. 2 months ago I started having problems with my internet and home service. Television was never interrupted. I was told since I live close to RR tracks, the signal could interfere with my service. I was also told same story about the Air Force base. Once that lie was disproven, I was told to move my modem to an outlet that only modem would use as modem was not getting enough power. Still getting kicked off internet and no phone service. The next day I replaced the modem @ Comcast and all the power lines and cable they supplied. Still getting kicked off internet and no phone service. @ the request of Comcast I replaced the splitter at my expense. I finally get fixed (I hope) then asked for a credit and was told I was lying, that I never called about this problem. Demanded to speak to someone else about getting a credit and was told this would not fix the problem! I agreed it would not fix the problem but make me feel better about paying for a service I could not use. I finally hung up. I will call everyday and ask for credit ."
"charles of West Memphis, AR",42157,1,"So, after having gone over Comcast's measly 300Gb data cap for a full year, I call up to cancel. I'm transferred to customer retention, where I explain my problem. Which is: I signed up for unlimited Internet. You changed the unlimited to limited because you don't like people streaming Netflix or downloading video games or you know, any of the 1000s of reasons people have for using the Internet. This wonderful customer retention specialist tells me he can give me a 500gb data cap and free HBO for a year. Wow. And just the month before I called to see about getting a higher package but was told that 300gb is the highest limit for residential customers. Whatever. Maybe they changed their mind. I took it. First month after that, no problems. Second month, my bill comes in and sure enough, I'm being charged for data overages. Called up Comcast again. 45 minute wait time. Just to be told that I was never signed up for any 500gb data cap plan, that the month where I wasn't charged for overages was a month where they had given me a ""pass""...one of three months allotted for customers who go over their data allotment. I've been going over my data plan for two years straight. I used those three months up the first three months they began instituting data caps. Liars. That's all these people do. Say something to get you off the phone and let someone else deal with you later. From now on, I'll record every call I have with these thieving liars and I urge everyone else to do the same. And when you catch them, post it where people can see."
"Mukesh of Jersey City, NJ",42156,1,"Having slow internet connections since last few days, have results from speedtest. Called Comcast rep to discuss about this. There was no resolution. Calls got disconnected multiple times. Seems like Comcast reps do not want to work on solving connrctivity issues."
"Larry of Dunwoody, GA",42156,1,"I tried Comcast under the 30 day free trial. The service did work well! But for other reasons I cancelled the account within the 30 day period. Their technician came out to take back the equipment - so far so good. But they kept billing me, and now have turned the 'free, no obligation, nothing owed' bill over to a collection agency. I have had no less than 3 people at Comcast who all assured me that they can and will fix this problem, but I continue to get calls. The collection agency tells me that I owe Comcast money, Comcast tells me I don't owe anything. It just shouldn't be this hard. They obviously still do not care about customer service - how hard can it be to fix this problem???"
"Rafiqul of Boston, MA",42155,1,"Comcast is terrible. I don't usually do reviews, but this time I feel that the potential Comcast customers should know what they are getting into once they sign up for Comcast services. I have been with Comcast the past 5 years and I never saw the services so bad. I signed up for a triple play with maximum 125 MBPS blast internet speed. That was what I was told in the beginning. Everything went pretty well till this March when things started to go really awry.First the speed came down to about 40-45 MBPS. But I didn't complain much because it was still good enough for browsing. But in April, 2015 I wanted to watch some cricket matches (the world cup) by live streaming. I just could not get my TV stream anything. I complained to customer services, and after about 5 days they did send out a technician. Have you ever had a Comcast technician come and fix the problem for you? They are so bloody arrogant and make you feel so low. Typical attitude: How stupid are you not to be able to figure out the solution for yourself; They do something and tell you everything will be fine from now. And the problem remains and you have no idea what was the issue and what he fixed. They make you feel like they are bestowing a huge honor just by showing up to your door. They are always out of the door in 5 minutes max. So the problem remained and I complained to customers services again. After another week or so they let me know that maybe the problem is with the router. So they said someone will come and replace the router and everything will be fine.The technician came, installed a new router and was out of my place before the router was actually online. Before leaving, he asked me to get an usb cable and other things from Amazon to speed up my services. I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about when I am supposed to have a wireless connection for all devices and I have a small apartment and all devices are close to the router. Finally I decided I have had enough (my internet speed is now down to 15 MBPS) and I cancelled the services from June 4, 2015. I called them o/a May 24 and schedule return of all equipment. I also pay all my outstanding bills. Imagine my consternation I receive a new bill of $122 for services from June 4 to July 3, 2015. I called the customer services again and somehow navigate my way to speak to someone at the payments department. I tell him my problem and he asks me to call cancellation department and resolve this. I request him to send a note to cancellation department or maybe talk to them internally to resolve my problem. He flatly tells me, that's not something they do and it is my responsibility that I resolve it with cancellation department. Ridiculous internal communication and follow up. I guess in order to not be charged with bills for services not received, I shall have to call them again. So sad. Comcast used to be a good company. Next time I will choose a smaller service provider who will attend to my needs and solve my problem. I wish some of us will get together and file a class action suit to hold these Company to better standards. You pay a lot and in return you are treated so bad that it hurts."
"Carl of Chico, CA",42155,1,Comcast has told me that they will review my recorded conversation with their sales rep. I told him NO. But they sent me equipment anyway and upgraded me to a service I did not agree to. The box has never been opened. Four times they promised to call me back with their review findings within two days. Last call I made to them they promised to send someone out to change my service back. No one has ever called to set a time to come out. I have invested several hours in talking with this huckster sleazy communications company that falls to honestly communicate. What they are doing does not seem legal.
"Donald of Covington, WA",42153,1,"In April, 2014 I signed up with a Comcast door-to-door agent to replace my DirecTV with a Comcast Quad package which included TV, Internet, Telephone, and Home Security. In the contract the monthly charge was $128.95 for the 1st year, $149.94 for the 2nd yr. and $189.90 for yr. 3 and on. After about 5 months I noticed my credit card charge was already over $180 per month. After no resolution with Comcast, I contacted the WA State Attorney Generals office who then contacted Comcast with my complaint. After some discussions with a Comcast agent I was told I was actually being undercharged. I found out on my most recent bill I am now being charged $232 per month. Although I have been reasonably satisfied with the 4 services I signed up for, I am totally dissatisfied with this change in my monthly cost, and am now trying to find out how much I will be charged to cancel these 4 services."
"Diane of Snellville, GA",42153,1,The internet service and phone service frequently went out. I requested help and was told a technician would come out and there would be no charge. It was discovered that the initial was incorrect and that we had a very poor signal due to a reversal of equipment that was placed in the box on the outside of our home. It was fixed on the second visit by the technician. Comcast charged $70 for a technical call and refused to reverse the charge until I called to cancel the service.
"Hyu of Baltimore, MD",42152,1,"I had no problem while I was using the service. The problem started when I closed the account, because of inter-state move. When I closed the account and went to the service center to return the equipment, they asked me for a switch that I've never received. They charged me around $40 (don't remember the exact amount) which made me really angry. I demanded to talk to a manager who was not helpful at all. I ended up paying and forgot about it.A couple of years later, when I applied for a loan, the loan officer came up to me and told me that there was an unpaid bill to Comcast which went to collection agency. Seriously? Before I close my account, I made sure that there's no bill to pay and they let me close the account which I believe because they didn't have any problem with that. I did not get a single notice or explanation and honestly I think this is one of their business models - ripping off the customer for no reason. I will never ever use Comcast again. This is the largest scam company."
"Charlie of Happy Valley, OR",42152,1,"Comcast is so terribly hard to get through and when you are able to spend the 5 minutes on the phone tree, they are not able to resolve the issue. My internet is drops and I am bumped offline and unable to use my smart tv or the cable in my house at random times. My laptop has to be hardwired into my printer to work..it is unbelievable. Frontier is at my office and if I do have a problem, they are easy to get a hold of and make it a priority to solve the issue if I have one..."
"Elizabeth of Greeley, CO",42146,1,"We've been customers of Xfinity for about 6-7 months now, with horrible service from the get go. We have high speed internet, of about 7 Mbps, or at least, we're supposed to have that speed. My internet disconnects or crawls through speed THOUSANDS of times a day. This is no exaggeration. In the last five minutes, my internet has cut out three times. We've called Comcast SEVEN times now, and had all sorts of different service attempts, to still have horrible internet.What's worse? Every time they've serviced us our internet has gotten LESS reliable and SLOWER. We're paying 60 dollars a month for service we can't even use, and to get responses from a company that doesn't care (to put it politely and mildly). Even worse? We're stuck in a town with only two horrible providers, one of which is Comcast. They know it, too, and manipulate you for every dime.I'm a college student, primarily online. Xfinity's HORRID internet service has glitched out on me several times, causing failed exams, homework assignments, and completely lost assignments altogether. I'm paying not only for bad internet service (if you even want to consider service that hardly works as SERVICE) but also for the stress and hair-pulling of trying to get work done online when I can't even stay connected for more than a couple of minutes. If there's anything that represents foul corporations that steal from their clients, it's Comcast. I'd definitely prefer a root canal, labor, or a car accident than to deal with Comcast again. We're switching, PERMANENTLY, this month."
"D of Miami, FL",42145,1,"My last two bills have been $158 and $190 for 50 mbps internet and basic cable plus latino package. YES, but the worst part is, I usually receive less than 10 mbps and sometimes a ridiculous reading of 1 or 2 mbps. I work from home and my internet disconnects at least FIVE times a day, impacting my productivity. I can't watch a Netflix movie entirely because I lost signal and I can't work wirelessly because the signal is ""schizophrenic."" Comcast sent an IT tech who did nothing but to unplug and plug my modem and tried to engage me in ""Personal Business"" asking me to let him ""do the job"" outside of Comcast...totally unacceptable.The worst part...I was charged $70 for that atrocity. I was given a partial credit on that. Another technician visited my place and told me that the service cannot be improved. I consulted my neighbors and they told me that their service is very poor. Comcast has been negligent to improve the service in my building but have collected based on a bad service. When I called about this situation, the representative suggested me that the only thing to do is to change my speed connection to 100 mbps and bundle my services. He offered it as a courtesy for the horrible services, but I only received more mislead. I was charged with this ""change in speed"" and my bill went from $130 to $155, and my DVR services were suspended. When I called to inquire about it they told me that the DVR would cost extra.In sum, I have been paying for an internet service of 50 mbps and I only receive 10 in average and sometimes as low as 1 mbps. COMCAST is aware of the situation but negligent to solve it. The building has a bad connectivity but they prefer to deal with each customer directly before solving the root of the problem. They charge money for a service they don't provide and they are negligent to solve it."
"Gabriel of Palmyra, VA",42145,2,"So I bought my own modem because paying $10 a month to rent is a total waste for a $70 item. They took the $10 off charge the first month and then added it back on the next. I autopay and didn't look at my bill for 24 months. Then I see the charge, call them, confirm that on their records it states I own the modem. Ask for a refund and they say, ""Nope, you have 30 days to dispute."" They admit it was their fault, that they were stealing for 2 yrs. Lame."
"John of Baltimore, MD",42142,1,"Really, Comcast? You are going to charge me $5 more per month because you had to process my new customer request, all because your website wouldn't accept my valid social security number? You guys are running a scam. No wonder everyone hates you."
"Todd of Oakhurst, CA",42142,1,"A year ago I was attracted by their promise to bill $59 a month for internet and TV, but skeptical. Never got to experience that agreement. If you are late in prepaying your monthly installment they will call you up to 7 times in one day. Evidently forgetting your demands to no longer call you. Never seen anything like it."
"Marilynn of Willits, CA",42141,1,"Trying to contact Comcast (again!) about invoice questions as well as equipment failure. As usual I get the automated run-around and hang-up after punching in phone number and zip code repeatedly while stuck in an endless loop taking me back to the main menu... until I get cut off. This pathetic company deserves a flaming pitchfork, not a star! (After writing this scathing review I can expect a saccharine email assuring me that they want to make it all right. I'm waiting, Comcast....)"
"Daniel of Marietta, GA",42140,1,"My wife spent three hours on the phone for them to fix our internet. It took them 3 hours to figure out we are on the slow internet service. Now the internet cuts out, wifi doesn't work. Technician came out and put a new cable on the ground, everything was working, now the internet cuts out again. My wife waited all day on Saturday for the technician to come out. When the technician replace the cable, he said everything was okay. I am NOT happy with Comcast and will change over when a better service shows up."
"DICK of Longmont, CO",42139,1,"Very very slow service on weekends, holidays and after local schools let out. Comcast has badly oversold its capacity to serve its customers."
"Mike of Port Republic, MD",42139,3,"Had connection problems and Comcast sent out tech 2 times never fixed, also never got any feedback. This all started happening when my 2 year contract was up and I was on a month to month charge. Called and got on a new contract and problems seem to have gone away. Sure hope this is not how they are running their business. But who are you going to get for service."
"rob of Granger, IN",42138,1,"The internet I pay for is awful. I pay a premium for what should be a premium service (blast internet speeds -- 50 Mbps), and don't receive anything close to acceptable. Comcast internet is an absolute scam."
"Anony of Martinez, GA",42137,1,"Let me start that on 5/9/15 me and my wife paid a deposit AND took care of a past due acct and decided to go with Comcast even though we had an active cable service with a competitor already connected. Sunday cable tech ran new lines to the house and left, NO signal from the new line, no internet all day, called 5 times and they assured me that MON. we would have service, guess what - NO service on Monday. Come to find out it was an open ticket for 8am to 8 pm. I lost my cool and they bumped me up to an ""escalated"" ticket for Tuesday. Guess what here it is Tuesday and NO tech no internet, I have called again at 5 more times and they said now they had me on an open ticket for all day... AGAIN! Now here it is going into Wed and I have an automated msg stating that I will have a service visit on Wed. from 1-3 pm. Let's see if this happens...I am SO frustrated at this whole ordeal, I don't even HAVE service and paid for it. The outsourcing aggravates me and every time I call I get some Indian csr with an English name like ** that has NO Clue to what's going on unless he reads my notations on my account which has been nothing but call after call after call waiting for a tech to activate my line for internet. I feel so stupid for disconnecting the other provider and it was ALREADY connected and running to my domicile!Here's what I learned, IF new cable has to be ran... that's what you get - ONE guy runs the cable, later a tech checks and activates the line on another date. NO MATTER how much or how many times you call, they will say anything to get you out of their hair, ANYTHING! The best thing to do is stay on the line as long as possible with them and hang up when done... why? Because every CSR is rated on how fast they get you done, that accounts for a Bonus, the longer you're on the lower their score, that lowers their bonus. Comcast service on the field sucks and this is before I actually have service with them JUST for internet."
"Olga of North Miami Beach, FL",42136,1,I ordered service back in January. At the time I ordered it they told me that I only pay $39 for installation. I had installation guy came in and installed the product. Next month I got bill with installation fee of $39 which I agreed on and paid and next month I got another bill with another charge of $39. I was going back and forth with Comcast on phone. Just called them today and they give me good story that installation fee its only to call installation guy in just to come and look at you at your house! In order for him to install the product you need to pay additional money! THIS COMPANY IS VERY TRICKY AND WILL TRY TO RIP YOU OFF OUT OF NOWHERE. DON'T USE THEM. IT'S A BIG MISTAKE THAT I DID. INTERNET SERVICE HAS LOTS OF OUTAGE AND IT'S NOT STABLE! Waste of money!
"Ryan of Pompano Beach, FL",42135,1,"Comcast, a company only out to get money. I say this because I feel that this company, from since we started with them in 2013 has always over charged us, made us waste time waiting on them to come to our home to get service and even when we were going through hardships and couldn't pay the full bill, has no courtesy for us and didn't want to work with us. I spoke to a supervisor named **, he was so arrogant and came up with some solution to only give me service for one day and then had the guts to tell us that he is going to charge us 2 reconnection fees. I Was very frustrated with him and just decided to cut the service off completely. I dealt with this bs service for too long. I would never recommend this company to anyone, I will tell everyone to go with At&t and just avoid ever going to comcast. I Hate them with a passion."
"Tom of Malverne, NY",42135,1,"Comcast is basically inept. As an owner of residential properties in South Florida, I have cause to subscribe to the internet for seasonal tenants. Comcast is not set up for this. What surprises me is that with as many rental property's that are in South Florida, you would think that they deal with situations such as this where there's policy and procedures. They can't get it right the first time ever. Last year I attempted to pay for the complete service in advance, and have the service turned off automatically. They can't do this. When you live in another city and attempt to resolve issues for your own account, they need your account number. There's no way to get it. Unless you have the account # you can't help yourself, and if you are not in S. Florida, you can't just pop into one of their offices and help yourself. It took me between 25 and 30 telephone hours last year only to wind up with a second account when the dust settled and I had to start over. This year, armed with the account number I attempted to pay over the telephone, and they got it wrong again. The details are too arduous to list here. I attempted to pay my tenants internet bill on the telephone and after asking the total amount owed for the entire length of the stay, they still got it wrong. It only took 56 minutes this time to get to a resolution, (We'll see) but I needed to acquiesce to paying a reinstallation of my TV service just to save having to get onto another department. This, even though I pay for the TV as part of my HOA maintenance fee. They never should have turned off my TV in the first place! I've never been late with my condo maintenance!! In the case of my internet commitment, I attempted to pay in full 3 days after I asked to have it shut down (BTW, they didn't do that either) and they were still billing me for the subsequent month of April!I thought all that I went through was possibly because I'm an imbecile, but last month at a gathering of 30 people up in Sebastian, FL, someone brought up the topic of the ineptitude of Comcast, and all hell broke loose. Everyone in attendance was attempting to top the prior complaining attendee with yet another tale of woe from their own past Comcast experiences. This actually made me feel better as it's an indication that Comcast is actually poorly run and it wasn't me!So, without other recourse in dealing with this monopoly, I can only attempt to warn others. When you speak to a Comcast employee, first ask for their name and company ID. For you see, if the call becomes too difficult for them they just drop you off the line and you will need to start over. Thanks to you who have read this. I hope that my comments help to preclude the loss of time patience and money of other unsuspecting Comcast consumer."
"Leo of Charlottesville, VA",42134,1,"Comcast had gotten good reviews from our friends. So we gave it a try. The wifi worked well for a few months. With 3 iphone and 2 laptops using it, it did pretty well. After about 5 months it slowed way down. I truly noticed this when I was shopping for myself. Nothing would load up. It says that the wifi is connected with 5 bars. This wifi has so many problems. I wish I had known that before hand."
"Luz of North Plainfield, NJ",42133,1,On my bill according to my services I am paying for internet speed of 50mbps when in reality I can't even watch YouTube video. When I go online and test the speed it shows only 12mbps. I am furious because they don't received a partial payment so I deserve a full service.
"Dee of League City, TX",42132,1,"I relocated to League City Texas area 4-1-15. I ordered cable and Internet services from Comcast/Infinity. It was installed on 4-2-15. I received my first bill on 4-16-15. I paid $200 in full 4-22-15. Then I received a bill due 5-17-15. I called Comcast to exchange a box, and ask how much was my bill. Then I was told that I ordered a fight on 5-2-15 Sat. I never ordered the fight. Then I was told I ordered 2 other movies that I did not order. I ask for a supervisor and explained that I did not order those movies she stated that they were not removing them and that I had to pay for them.How do you fight a company like that when they just want to make money off of their customers? Don't care that it's possible that they made a mistake on their end. I am looking for a new cable company that service my area. It's not right for a company to do that to customer just because they can and get away with it. New to the Texas area and I have learned to do your research on companies before accepting their services. I would not ever recommend Comcast to anyone."
"Sara of Portland, OR",42130,1,"I ordered Blast internet, yet that professional grade of internet never worked in our home. We had three techs agree that it wasn't working and never follow through with fixing it. I called to troubleshoot multiple times and told that it was working even though speed tests proved otherwise. My complaints were never noted and so I could not get money back for the non-existent service. Furthermore, it took me 1 hour and 46 minutes to cancel my cable because, shockingly, the man on the phone could not figure out how to do it. Instead he kept saying, ""Please, I got you a great new deal. Just sign up for this because the cancellation is not working""."
"Sarah of Raymond, WA",42130,1,"I have been dealing with issues regarding my services since installation. Comcast tells you one thing without follow through, and outsources technicians that are unfamiliar with their product. They lack customer services, and charge you for services you are unable to get. They are extremely unprofessional and in my opinion the WORST cable provider.. In my opinion this company is a fraud that will waste your time and steal your money."
"Tanya of Davie, FL",42129,1,This is my first time writing a review and I think it is important for people to know just how horrible Comcast is as a cable company. I hear the horror stories but never knew I would have one of my own. I relocated to a new condo over a month ago and requested for Comcast to disconnect and switch service to the new address. My online account never reflected the requested updated new address info and had a zero balance. I called and waited on customer service for 3 hours!!! Really? 3 hours??? When is this ever acceptable for any business! This is a shame and disgrace.I took several calls to find out my service was disconnect for $30. How can you make a payment on a $0 balance on your account. This company does not have the right to acquire Time Warner as a merge and the big monopoly of corporate should be limited so other competitors can be a part of the market. I know why people go to DirecTV... It makes sense now.
"Jaye of Tacoma, WA",42128,2,"About a month ago, I began having difficulty with my internet connection. So, I carried my laptop to a local coffee shop, and set up a connection there. Problem solved. Then, I called Comcast and spoke with a technician (in the Philippines). They sent out a technician to look at my Comcast equipment and connection. He informed me that the problem ""must be my computer, because the equipment seems to be fine."" So, I arranged with a professional technician to check my computer. It turns out that the problem was indeed with the Comcast box. The router part of the box was going bad. When I called Comcast again, they told me I would have to come pick up a new box myself and hook it up myself. So many problems, so much cost, so little service!"
"Meridian of Centralia, WA",42126,1,"I had two internet options available to me when I first moved here about 10 years ago; Qwest DSL and Comcast Cable. I had questions about both and so contacted both companies; I made my decision to go with Comcast based solely on one thing: it was easy to reach real people who spoke English with Comcast, while I never could figure out how to talk to a person at Qwest.Everything was fine for a few years, but then it started falling apart. My internet started disconnecting with increasing frequency, until it was happening several times an hour. I work two jobs from home, both of which require internet connection, so this was not only frustrating but also costly. I called customer service and they told me to get a new modem. I drove 100+ miles to the nearest Comcast store and got one. Problem solved... for about 9 months, when it started disconnecting several times an hour again.This time I noticed something... the disconnecting was only happening in the daytime on hot, sunny days. Obviously some connection somewhere was expanding with the heat and messing up the connection, or something. The correlation was so strong that I could predict what days I would have connection issues by looking at the weather forecast. I called Comcast to report my findings in the hope they'd be able to really fix the issue, and this was when I discovered customer service no longer spoke English very well. But, I was able to get someone out who fixed some connection in the ground that was shorting out. Internet worked great... until next summer.Since then, for the last 5 or 6 years, every summer is a constant battle. I can go weeks without having a full day of continual connection. I can't make the customer service reps understand my problem.... they just tell me to ""unplug the modem for 15 seconds or to get a new modem."" It is incredibly insulting to be sitting there on hold with your internet down while their stupid robot voice tells you to go online to check for outages. It's even more insulting when they try to get you to pay more for extra crap I don't want when what I already have doesn't work.I would switch to Qwest but my roommate has been battling with them for years too, though for different issues. The only other options around here are all dial-up (did you know they still even had dial-up?!) and that's just not good enough for my jobs. It's an incredibly frustrating situation and oh how I look forward to the day there is another option available... I'd even be willing to set aside my long-standing hatred of Google and try their service. It can't possibly be worse."
"Tess of Chicago, IL",42125,1,"Comcast Xfinity is the worst of the worst. Each time I need to call in about something, I constantly get the run-around: each person you talk to will each give you a completely different answer to the question you're asking. If you're not able to get your cable and Internet pricing lowered, hang up and call back to get someone else. It took me 6 different people to finally talk to someone who was able to give me a fair and cheap price for my service. When I have a technical problem and the person you start talking to sounds like an idiot, hang up. They probably are. You will end up wasting your time on this person only to have one of two things happen: 1. They hang up on you because they can't figure it out or 2. Will waste your time blabbing about everything you already told them was wrong and end up having to transfer you, in which your call gets dropped anyway. These people are terrible, this company is a joke. If AT&T services my building, you bet your butt I would switch to them. Ugh."
"Noel of Yulee, FL",42123,1,"We have had little choice in our internet provider since we moved into our home. Sadly the only carrier is Comcast. Do not waste your money. We have been calling everyday since we got the service for sub par performance. For the amount we pay, we are supposed to receive UP TO 50 Mbps. We are lucky if we ever get 10. Currently as I write this, I am on hold waiting for a Comcast supervise again, and we getting a raging 0 Mbps and 0 upload while managing to somehow be on the net. Last week, we lost service for 3 days, no refund offered, we had someone ""working on the problem"" in our neighborhood. It magically worked for the weekend. The same time they were working on it out in front of my house, we had a tech come into our home and check out our connection, check the lines that were just installed, and everything is FINE. It's Comcast not providing what people are paying for. I am tired of fighting them, but what can I do? It's all our new neighborhood offers. If you plan on buying or building a house, reconsider if the only cable company in your neighborhood is Comcast. It's not worth the hassle."
"Scott of Chicago, IL",42122,1,"I canceled Comcast Internet service when I was moving to a new state. I received two bills after I canceled service, the last one coming 5 weeks after service was canceled. I called Comcast to ensure that it was my final bill and the Comcast rep ensured me that it indeed was my final bill. I paid that amount and thought I was done with Comcast.About two weeks later I get a letter from a collection agency stating that I owe Comcast $73 and that I must pay $157 to the agency. I never received any bill or correspondence from Comcast and when I called to talk to them, Comcast stated that I had a credit of $85. The $ doesn't really bother me, but I am in escrow on a house and this account has knocked my credit score down over 100 points and will significantly affect my mortgage rate. I had nearly an 800 credit score and this thing has knocked me down to the 660's. I'm working to get it all straightened out, but it may not get worked out in time for my closing, if at all.Comcast Internet wasn't any good in the first place, but this ordeal has been a real thorn in my side for weeks now. It has been echoed on this site often, Comcast has a monopoly and truly does not care about service or what kind of damage they do caused by their clueless reps. If you research Comcast and still go with them, I've got no sympathy for you. It's better to go without than have to deal with them. "
"Tom of Neptune Beach, FL",42122,1,Internet Service Intermittent Outages Daily Dec 2014 - April 2015 - I have called Comcast customer service several times a week for the last 4 months because of outages and I get the runaround. They have old technology in my neighborhood that they can't get parts for and so customers are left with poor or no service. No one knows what is going on to resolve this issue so at this point I have to look at alternatives like AT&T or cellular.
"Peter of Naples, FL",42122,1,"I have used Comcast internet service for 15+ years, using a proxy email address at the IEEE so that my contacts see a consistent mail address irrespective of the ISP that I use. Last week I stopped getting mail. I received a message that I needed to switch from POP to IMAP and did so. No mail. I reset the account several times; received unfiltered mail for a day then it stopped. Tried logging into Comcast directly to see my mail and the time taken to log in was 10 minutes+. Today I have been 20 waiting 20 minutes to log into the mail server. In desperation I talked to their service line for an hour, half of it with a supervisor. They gave me a couple of ports to try and concluded that it was a Microsoft problem (I have used MS Outlook 2007 since it came out). I argued that that was ridiculous and their response was ""buy Outlook 2010 or 2013"". I am switching my mail service to Google and changing my proxy. Comcast's response time is intolerable for running a business, and their failure to deliver IMAP mail through Outlook is absurd."
"Donna of Allen Park, MI",42122,1,"April of 2015 I ordered comcast internet. I was told I could hook up the modem myself and be charged 9.95. If they had to send out a tech they would charge me 39.99 (no charge if it's no fault of my own). Well, guess what? I could not get the modem to work. Comcast sent a tech to my home. The tech told me it would never have worked because comcast sent me a modem for the wrong region. He went back to his truck and switched modems and it worked. I called customer service and explained what happened. The gentleman told me someone would get back to me through an email. Week and a half no word.I called comcast back and spoke with a woman and explained my situation again. She said she seen the notes and asked if I could hold while she consulted a supervisor. I waited on the phone 45 minutes and someone came on the phone asking for all the information again. I told her I was on hold and that someone was helping me. She said they transferred me to her (the payment center). Again I had to explained all the information. By this point I have been on the phone an hour and a half trying to get my bill straightened out. Now, this woman transfers me once again. This time I asked for a supervisor so I don't keep getting pushed off on someone else. I explained what the tech had said about the modem. She said comcast didn't have modems for different region. Comcast can come get their stuff. Very poor customer service."
"Ryan of Bayville, NJ",42122,1,"Comcast first of all raised my bill $20 a month without warning or a notice. And now they charge me $40 for a house call when the technician did absolutely nothing. No wires were installed, no new modem, NOTHING. The tech sat at my computer, in my computer chair and went to speednet.com to check the speed on my connection and left. Said my internet is working fine!!! Horrible service and after speaking with ** from customer service for over an hour there is nothing they can do.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! Since when do we charge the customer for something wrong with the service you offer to the customer!!! I wish I could go to Verizon but I can't because they do not service my area, so I am STUCK with CRAPPY COMCAST!!!"
"margie of St. Leonard, MD",42121,2,Over the past year I have received the worse service from Comcast in the 10+ years I've been a loyal customer. The issue I originally called about has not yet been resolved because the rep either hangs up on me when they can't fix the problem or the rep just gives up and emails me information so I can read and fix myself. As soon as I can find a company that provides high-speed internet and cable TV I will take my business elsewhere.
"tanner of Heber, UT",42120,1,"Literally garbage. Can't keep a connection going for more than I'd say 45 minutes MAX. I've never been so discontent with any kind of phone, tv or internet service in my life and I grew up using dial up. Don't get this whatever you do. Straight trash."
"Tanya of Washington, DC",42118,1,"I have been a Comcast customer since 2011. A couple of days ago Comcast inexplicably disconnected my internet services. When I contacted customer support, I was initially transferred between multiple departments. Finally, one representative told me that there was service outage in my area, that technicians were working on the problem, and that I would be re-connected at 7:30pm that evening. This did not happen.Concerned because I had several papers due and needed the internet for research purposes, I contacted Comcast's customer services a second time. This time was told that my account had been deactivated and that in order to reactivate it, I would need to purchase wifi services ($39.99) and a self-installation kit ($9.95). I was told that I could either travel to a local service center or wait 3-5 business days for a kit to be mailed. I chose to wait for the kit to be mailed because I did not have time to travel to the service center.Because I needed internet service to complete work for school, I ended up using my cellular hotspot for several days while waiting for the self-installation kit. Charges for the additional data totaled nearly $100. When I finally received the self-installation kit, I opened it to find two coaxial cables, a bag of cable tacks, and a splitter. Although I had been told that the kit would contain an activation code, there was no such code in the kit. I did not know what to do with the items I did receive so, once again, I contacted Comcast's customer support.The first representative I spoke with was unable to help me and told me that my account was in ""inactive mode."" He then transferred me to another department. The second Comcast representative I spoke with was also unable to help but told me that he had ""escalated my issue to upper management."" He then transferred me to another department. Finally, the third representative I spoke with was able to reconnect my internet. At no point were any of the items in the self-installation kit used.Worst of all, no one bothered to mention that Comcast might have a wifi hotspot in my area that I could use while I was waiting to be reconnected. I only found out that this option was available after a friend mentioned it while I was chatting with the Comcast representative who was finally able to reconnect me. Obviously, by that time this was a moot point. This entire process was exhausting and completely uncoordinated. Each representative I spoke with asked me to list the same information and apparently Comcast kept no record kept of the issue because I also had to describe my problem each time. At no point was I given an explanation for why my service had been disconnected."
"ileana of Hollywood, FL",42118,1,Customer Service poor knowledge of their services. Don't give out the right information. I have been dealing with the same issue for over three months now and still giving me a new ticket to try to solve the problem. What is going on with them?
"Michael of Sanjose, CA",42117,1,"Got Comcast a few months back. Not only are they unable to provide the internet signal I am paying for - they give me the complete run around every time you call the support. The ""agents"" consistently switch me from one channel to the other and the result stays the same, the signal goes down 3-10 minutes for every 30 minutes of use. I have been switched between channels approximately 8 times now, I have also been sent to their store for a replacement modem/router and nothing helps. They now tell me that I need a service tech and that I may end up paying for the service tech even though their product never worked to begin with. Of course one of their ""agents"" told me that I could buy an insurance policy for $5 a month so I would not be charged for the service visit. You have got to be kidding me!!! This is the worst company I have ever done business with - it is a fraud, pure and simple. I am being charged for a product that doesn't work!! Fraud!!"
"matt of Braselton , GA",42113,1,"Please do not utilize this service. They will promise great things to get you to sign up but no customer service after up to and including outright lies. I was with DirecTV, two HD DVR's, one other HD set top and one other normal definition set top. This was bundled with phone and internet at 6Mbs. The bill for this was at $130.00 roughly.I called xfinity/comcast and they quoted me $59/month for 50Mbs internet and phone. I specifically asked that I needed to keep certain channels (espn, amc, natgeo were among these). No mention of installation costs and confirmation that there was no contract but this price was good for two years. I received my first bill of $177. Since this day the nightmare they call customer service has not been able to resolve the billing issue. They insist that I signed up for the ""triple play"" at $89/month.Internet speed averages around 7Mbs. I have called their customer service and the CSR told me that they were having lots of issues with the cisco modem/router combo and that I would get better speeds if I bought my own router and modem. I did so ($250) but the speeds did not change. I called them once again and they sent a tech out 2 days later (two hours late for appointment). He said the signal from the curb to my house was ok, but signal to the area was bad. He stated that an engineer would be send out to correct it. Next day an automated call from comcast informed me the situation was fixed but I am still at 5-12 Mbs. This issue continues...Back to tv programming: at least 8 calls have been place to resolve programming. And at each call the situation with my programming gets worse. It even seems there may be some vindication happening as they reduced my service to the basic 30 channels (all crud btw) at midnight last night. When I call them today (Sunday) they say they cannot change service as their resolution center is closed.I am a consultant and am now going to be sending invoices at a charge rate of $300/hour for every hour I spent on the phone I am not billing to my customers. 4 hours today and counting. Now it seems they have put my box into deactivated mode. They insist that they cannot restore my channels without a 2-year agreement and $135/month billing rate. Do not do business with these people! Stay with Dish/DirecTV at all costs. The change will not be worth it."
"David of Atlanta, GA",42112,1,"Basically I was the victim of a bait-and-switch by the XFINITY store at Delk and Powers Ferry during purchase of the XFINITY home security system. I was told verbally during the presentation that it would be cancelled without fee if I moved outside Comcast area. No contract was presented until installation. It was signed for me without my being present. A year later I had to move and was charged a large and exorbitant termination fee. Customer service has been non-existent as I have been lied to, hung up on and kept waiting numerous times without any of the under-trained reps able to even understand the problem, much less assist. Also numerous promises to return my calls were not kept. I will not ever deal with Comcast again and neither should you. Worst experience ever with any company. System is not worth the hassle."
"Ellen of Shakopee, MN",42110,1,"My internet, cable and phone service all went out. When the technician came out, my outside line had been cut. He said they had been in my neighborhood installing new lines and for some reason forgot to connect me to a new line after it was cut. They left the exposed cable across my yard and said it would be at least 6 weeks before they would be back to bury it. I asked, ""Why so long?"" and their response was that they had other jobs to fulfill. I asked why I would have to wait since it was their error and they had no reason other than ""that is the way it is."" Needless to say, I changed companies and am saving $102 a month for the same services! What a rip-off and poor customer service. It always pays to compare. I definitely learned something."
"Sharon of Brentwood, TN",42109,1,"My home wifi was not working all of a sudden on April 13 and I contacted Comcast online to attempt to have it fixed. A woman named ** was working with me and told me I wasn't receiving a signal and would need to plug my modem into my PC. I explained I did not have a PC, only a smartphone and a laptop. She gave me a telephone number to call for help. When calling the number, it was answered as a ""non-working number for Comcast"". I went back to her and told her this and she gave me two more phone numbers, one which went to Verizon and another which also went to a ""non-working number for Comcast"". I double checked these numbers for accuracy against what she had typed to me. I promptly told this was absolutely pathetic. I got offline and called Comcast, only to be told that my equipment wasn't registered, which is nonsense, as it has been in use for over two years and had worked the previous day. In the meantime, a signal was present only to not work. I called Comcast again and spoke with **, who was very nice but it took some fiery language on my part to him in admonishing Comcast for the incompetence and negligence I had been subjected to for no reason. I told him I wanted to know why my internet was down and what needed to be done to fix it and I didn't want to hear another word out of him except for answers to those questions. After several minutes of back and forth and my basically telling him to get an answer for me this minute, he came back to tell me my Comcast modem is apparently now ""old equipment"" and must be exchanged. I found this ridiculous, especially given the fact that the previous two people at Comcast never mentioned this! How does this happen? The modem worked on April 13 and all of a sudden on April 14 it does not. No notice is sent from Comcast regarding any required equipment changes, it just happens and you are out of luck but still have to pay them? When are the powers that be going to wake up to their scams? ** told me to disconnect the modem and take it to Comcast to be exchanged. So it will be tomorrow afternoon (April 16) before I can do this so I will be without internet service for 3 days and they will still expect me to pay them? This company should not be allowed to be in businessŠ—_ Where is the Better Business Bureau on this? I have had other mind boggling instances in dealing with them as well and their customer service continues to be the worst of any company I have ever dealt withŠ—_ Why is Comcast allowed to continue to treat their customers in this manner?"
"J of Salt Lake City, UT",42109,1,"Comcast/Xfinity is the absolute worst internet service I've ever used. I am counting down the days until I move out of this apartment and can switch back to CenturyLink. My internet is INCREDIBLY slow, with regular delays. It doesn't make any difference which device I'm using -- it's always slow. Nightly, around 11pm, the internet strength reduces significantly to the point that whatever I'm watching on Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube through my AppleTV freezes, taking forever to reload, and repeating this process until I eventually give up and go to sleep. I will NEVER NEVER NEVER solicit service from Comast or Xfinity again. It's essentially useless. ** XFINITY!!!"
"Rufus of Seattle, WA",42108,1,"Comcast is horrible at customer service mostly because the people you always talk to are so far removed from you, usually India - they have no idea what we are dealing with over here. I will make a list problems I've had with them and they are apparently reoccurring to a sickening degree.They always raise the price of my bill which I've read happens to people all the time, adding on ** extras that I never asked for. I have had to call and complain about this about 7 or 8 times in the last few years. The way they always try to resolve this is to give you a 'package deal' which only would result in me paying more money, another tactic that I found out is always used to scam customers. This way they make you think they are saving you money and giving you such a good deal.They always say they will change something or adjust your bill and it might change for a month or two and then surprise, next month it's back up again. And no one is held accountable, if you ask them for their names they say, ""We are not allowed to divulge that information"" so you can never say this specific person promised me blah blah blah and make someone accountable. The only way to beat this I've read is to record all your calls with them and they also have I.D. Numbers so you have to ask them for their ID numbers. But you have to be religious about doing these things and keep track of every detail to use later. They transfer your calls like nobody's business, back and forth between departments so if you have a detailed problem you have to explain it thoroughly 5 times before someone can actually address your problem.They also pretend like they can't change your bills themselves when in fact many of these people can. The last battle I had with them I got transferred 3 times when I was about to quit Comcast for good because a new company just moved into my area (Seattle) and I was telling them it's possible for me to pay less. Only then do they listen to you and this woman finally just clicked a button and changed my bill back to 49.95$ per month. And this was after I got a bill for 88.45$ for my monthly charge. And this woman was actually American - after talking to two foreigners they finally transferred me to someone local because they knew I was ready to quit and none of these workers likes to have that on their record because it looks bad on their quotas or how ever they do it.And finally after all this pretending like she went out of her way to work really hard to look for a deal she could offer me she promised me to change my bill back to 49 and some change when I check it the next day and it still shows up as 88.45$ that I owe so I am just about to call the map once again to complain. I broke my own rule when I forgot to ask for her ID number to keep her accountable.In conclusion I am still constantly looking for a company that is willing to start offering a decent rate for internet service. Comcast is a horrible monopoly for the most part and it's only getting worse. They are buying up smaller companies that can't compete just swallowing them up one by one, like Charter and smaller local companies. Please everybody keep posting your bad reviews and spreading the word, they are just treating customers horribly because they can and we need to stop putting up with it."
"Douglas of Chicago, IL",42107,1,"My medical office had Comcast business internet for several years. A year ago, I retired and closed the office when I turned 75. I moved the fast service to my home. I am now moving out of state so I requested the service be shut off. Comcast said when the service was moved, a new contract started and I have to pay a $2,300 early termination fee. In the contract, they were giving me a $10 discount from $109 to $99 monthly which explains the termination fee. A company engaging in a shameless grift. Truly pathetic. Elizabeth Warren is right. Big Corporations lie and cheat people and think nobody will stop them. Have they no shame?"

It has been made almost impossible to switch to another company due to the inability of possibilities. What zip code area are you in? What services are available in that area?

"Greg of Pittsburgh, PA",42104,1,"WARNING: Under no circumstances should you consider Xfinity Home Security. We recently installed Xfinity Home Security in our home in San Francisco. The Comcast representative knew we would be moving soon to Pittsburgh PA and assured us that we could transfer our service. Nothing could be further from the truth. We had to battle for weeks to get the service transferred and we had a horrible battle over an early termination fee. Comcast incorrectly billed us twice for installation and we spent days and days on the phone with call center people who could not correct the problem. In the meantime, we needed to disconnect the system for 4 to 6 months while we renovated our home. Comcast refused to discontinue the billing while we had the system shut down. Keep in mind we are paying our Comcast bill at our other address in Pittsburgh.After a two-month battle with Comcast, we gave up and returned our Comcast equipment. Comcast told us we needed to return the additional motion detectors we had paid for. We received no refund for the equipment that we had purchased. Several weeks later, we get a call from Comcast Customer Solutions now saying they would consider allowing us a six-month billing delay while we renovated. We asked them how could we ever get our bill corrected? They didn't know. We asked them if we would now be charged for a third installation fee? They did not know. We asked them if we were going to have to buy the additional motion detectors again? They did not know. We respectfully asked them to forgive the early termination fee and they said THEY WOULD PURSUE US FOR THE EARLY TERMINATION FEE.Keep in mind, I am paying a monthly fee for Comcast services at my current address. I asked ** if the several hundred dollar early termination fee was worth losing a customer who will be paying Comcast for another 20 or 30 years and he said the early termination fee was more important. We have been a Comcast customer for over 25 years and we are winding down ALL of our services with Comcast. On a scale of 0 to 10, there is not a number low enough to rate Comcast."
"Kristen of Modesto, CA",42104,1,"This complaint is based on my current Comcast service. 3-4 days out of 30 my service is out. I am currently a full time student and I require the internet to complete assignments, and this is of no concern to Comcast. I have had slow internet, cable channels that are forever pixelating, they send a technician that never fixes anything. This service is expensive and horrible."
"Matt of Houston, TX",42103,1,"From the very beginning, we've had nothing but problems with Comcast's Internet service. The service will randomly drop and sometimes not return for hours. Every time we call regarding these happenings, Comcast blames our ""outdated hardware,"" regardless of the fact that own the most up-to-date Motorola modem that is on the market. Regardless, this is all beside the point.I've had a few dealings recently with Comcast support, and they've only seem to become more and more condescending and less helpful with each conversation. I currently work for Apple from home, and we're set to move into a different unit in our complex at the beginning of next month. Given that they advertise that their Movers Edge service provides a completely seamless transition between locations, I figured it'd be worth setting up a transfer. I was told the transition would take 48 hours. Correct me if I'm wrong, but 48 hours doesn't really fall under the umbrella of ""seamless"" as far as how most average human being interpret words. We're not allotted time to move. We have to do it completely on our own time. So now, thanks to Comcast, I'm going to be forced to take an unpaid day (complete with negative attendance points) due to the fact that they're advertising more than they can actually do for you. Then again, I shouldn't be surprised at this point. Nothing ever works out how it should with this company.My two biggest pieces of advice:1. Hire employees who are mentally capable of actually empathizing with customers, and who can even remotely come across like they have any idea what they're talking about.2. Advertise your services exactly as you provide them. I equate Comcast with used cars salesmen at this point. They do and say whatever they need to do to get you in, and then offer no help once you're there."
"Paula of Canton, GA",42102,1,"The second month of a new account was double billed. I have called over 15 times and spent 20+ hours on the phone trying to get someone at customer service to correct the billing. If I'm lucky enough to get someone on the phone that can even pull up my account, they say they've never seen this before and need to submit it to billing for an investigation. Then, I never hear from anyone regarding the mistake. My account is now set to disconnect for the 3rd time. The double billing is their mistake, but I get to pay for it in wasted time and frustration."
"Jennifer of Knoxville, TN",42102,1,"I've had Comcast internet, TV and phone service for almost 3 years. I purchased my own modem from Best Buy (I have receipt and box spent $189) so I didn't have to rent from Comcast for $7-$10 a month. About 3 months after the start of service I received my first letter stating during a review of my account they have noticed I am not paying the modem rental. I called and stated it was my modem and so therefore I did not need to pay them. Oh yes they said sorry about that and removed the charges. Now every 2 months since this first letter I get another letter stating the same thing!! I've called approximately 20 times to correct this problem. I've given them the receipt, and personally gone into the office (and talked to the employees making minimum wage and unable to do anything about my issue). No one seems to know what is going on or why I'm constantly being charged for my own equipment!! One employee has made a ""ticket"" which was supposed to go to a higher employee and they would contact me. This never happened!! I could go on with the other issues we have had such as our sudden extremely large increase in broadband usage when nothing changed in our house! Supposedly we went from using 21GB a month to over 300GB! Really? The only thing we did was supposedly upgrade our service so the only difference is on the Comcast end!! I was previously in another state with Suddenlink and boy do I wish we were still in their area! Comcast is absolutely the worst company I have ever used!! If I could give them zero stars I would!!"
"Chris of Fort Campbell, KY",42101,1,"Back in December 2014 I cancelled my account with Comcast due to the fact that the internet was not 50 mb that they claim it to be, it was more like 10 mb on a good day. So sent my equipment back to the local store, dealt with a very rude customer service rep. Was told that i would receive a final bill within 60 days. Well long story short, was never sent a bill from Comcast, which in turned sent my bill to some collection agency. I then called the collection agency to find what was going on. So at that time i filed a BBB complaint. Got a call from someone claiming to be from the Executive Office of Comcast. Boy let me tell you, that employee represented the company at its finest. Rude, No help, even more rude, had a attitude like i was wasting her time and offer no solution.. Told the young lady that I wanted to speak to someone higher up and had to explain to this fun employee that she wasn't the top of comcast and that I wanted to speak to someone higher. She put in the 24 hr request so we will see what happens."
"G. N. of Portland, OR",42097,1,"We have always been very pleased with Comcast tech support. But they must have decided to save some money, because today I had a terrible experience. I was calling for help with an app that wasn't working properly. I had to go through about 5 min. of robo call to get an agent. Eventually I had talked with 3 agents, none of whom were able to help. Despite giving my phone number at least 3 times, when I was cut off with the first agent (their mistake) she didn't call me back. So back to the robo call and 2 agents later, no help at all. They have outsourced and each of the 3 agents had a strong accent and talked very fast so it was hard to understand them. This is the first time I've thought about getting a different internet provider."
"Kevin of Jacksonville, FL",42097,1,"I recently received my bill from Comcast. My normal monthly charges are $119 plus taxes, surcharges, fees. Total should be about $144 (verified via emails from Comcast). This bill is $287!! I reviewed the bill and learned that $68 of it was a balance from my last account (I recently moved). I had no problem with that amount, but $68 + $144 DOES NOT EQUAL $287. I also noticed double charges on the bill. I called Comcast, emailed Comcast (20+ times), and am now emailing Comcast Corporate... all with no resolution. I have received an email from 1 of their employees a few days ago telling me the bill IS correct and from now on my bill will be $218 a month??? I was furious. I have been calling a specific employee at Corporate (15 times) and can never get through. I have asked her to email me an answer: I agreed to pay the $144 plus $68 from past account and asked for an answer. I have received no specific response to that request. I am furious, will NOT pay $287 NOR will I pay $218 a month. I have threatened to cancel my service and have contacted DirecTV. I prefer to keep Comcast, but not at that price."
"Mar of Fredericksburg, VA",42097,1,They simply tick up the cost of their services gradually over time and customers are completely helpless and unable to do anything about it.
"S. of Memphis, TN",42096,1,"I signed up for Comcast Security in December 2013, canceled in January 2014 within the 30 day period and my service was inactivated. Since then I have called to tell them that I am still being billed as recent as April 2, 2015 ($100+) a month for over 16 months. Confirmed today that my security services cannot be troubleshooted because they are inactive. Why have I paid over $1,600 for inactive service and continuing to pay because if I don't, all my other services will be disconnected as well and I need my internet so I have been forced to pay for the security service even though it has been inactive since January 2014 and confirmed again today with ** in Home Security Trouble Shooting Department that my security service is inactive but it remains on my bill. This service has been inactive since January 2014 as noted/recorded in several calls (over 75) made to Comcast through out 2014. I was also just told today that I do not qualify for the $100 gift card that was promised to me in January - April of 2014 for all of my inconveniences (after calling in threatening to cancel all services and switch over to AT&T) and being told as early as March 31, 2015 that I did qualify for it and it was in the mail. Comcast departments has purposely deceived me into paying for their services while knowing that I wanted to cancel the Xfinity Home Service over 16 months ago."
"robert of Eugene, OR",42095,1,"I canceled Comcast business internet and phone due to illness and business being closed. Also due to their gross mismanagement of my account requiring me to call them several times each month to straighten it out. They would take the information, say it would be taken care of, and then nothing would be done. After several complaints they got rude and unresponsive, charged my credit card even after I had changed the card (3 times) - charged me for items without sending a bill. Refuse to cancel account even after I wrote them an e-mail to their consumer service stating I was canceling. They change the bills each month and say I owe them for an early termination fee. They broke the contract first. I owe them nothing."
"paul of Duluth, GA",42093,1,"Comcast implemented data cap in my area, allocation of 300 GB for residential accounts. I was told by a rep, after reaching the data limit my account will be charge $10 for an addition 50Gb. This is outrageous. Unfortunately, they can force this on us because of a lack of competition."
"Tom of Lowell, MI",42090,1,"I was a relatively happy Comcast Business Internet customer for several years. I am a physician who is also an IT executive who works out of my home. We built a new house and discovered that Comcast did not offer service at the new location. When we attempted to disconnect the service they would not do anything without my account number. We were on e-billing and the account number was not included in the billing notice. All of our business paperwork was packed and in transit so not available. I spoke with at least 6 different CSRs over a two month period in which several things were promised but not followed up on; sending a paper bill (promised on 3 occasions) which would include the acct. number; a supervisor would call (on 4 occasions, only the last time did it occur); and I was to be transferred to a higher authority and call dropped 3 times. Finally in late January, a sympathetic CSR (many were not, some were concerned but didn't know what to do) took the time to directly contact a supervisor who could help with the disconnect and who finally sent me the documentation for a Voluntary Disconnect that included my account number (this process took approximately 45 minutes to accomplish, but a mere pittance compared to the approximately 5 hours I had spent to this point). I filled out the form immediately and returned it. Now, 2 months later I am still receiving bills for service that was no longer being used for 4 months. I was informed that it takes 60 days to perform a disconnect.I am willing to pay the 2 months of fees, starting in November, if that is what my contract calls for. However, I am not willing to pay for 4 months. In addition, my time is too valuable to have to spend this much time for ANY business related service. I have heard horrid reviews of poor service by Comcast but never in my life would I have anticipated that shutting off my internet would be this difficult, and expensive."
"rogelio of Montgomery, IL",42090,1,"Well I call customer service 2 days ago asking why my internet is very slow. They said ""you have the basic."" I said ""OK but I'm customer. I'm not so happy what I can do."" The guy said ""I can give 2 pks for 54.99, include t.v and internet."" I said ""I don't need the t.v."" He said ""is the only way"". I said ""really"". I'm very disappointed why service is bad. But when I said no he said ""let transfer with others peoples"". I said OK but I was in the line 15 mins waiting. No one help me. After that somebody disconnected my call. Not good at all. I'm looking for different company."
"wanda of Abingdon, VA",42090,1,"Hmm, let's see where to begin.... Their speeds are not accurate no matter where you live. I've had the misfortune of living in two areas where they own a monopoly and it was never the speed they sold you. You are INCREDIBLY lucky if you can get through to talk to someone without them or the automated system hanging up on you. My BIGGEST complaint is how they will pad the bill and not tell you. Just don't take the story I'm about to tell you. Read all the others posted here on this forum. Somehow when I upgraded my service last year & bought myself a new modem (from Best Buy) for the DOCSIS 3.0 upgrade, the billing team decided to put down I was renting the DARN thing.... I didn't notice till one year later and all I got was a sorry and $20 credit. If they didn't have a monopoly in my current region, I would definitely change in a flash."
"T of Laplace, LA",42088,1,"After 3 times of a Comcast tech tried to fix the issues with cable and Internet I switched. Trying to get an actual person off the phone took between 45 minutes to 2.5 hours. I finally had to drop off all the equipment off at their local branch. I also called my bank to pull the payment from Comcast. Of the 23 days I had their service, if you call it that, I had 3 days of actual cable TV and Internet."
"Julie of Baltimore, MD",42088,1,"We had contacted Xfinity/Comcast to set up a thermostat that would allow us to remotely set the temperature of our home on 3/19/2015. They were supposed to come on 3/21/2015 to install the thermostat but never showed. On 3/23/2015, my husband contacted them again to set an appointment. The customer service representatives were unable to provide a reason for their missed appointment that Saturday. We set another appointment for 3/24/2015 between 1PM and 3PM. The technician did not show up until 6:30 PM. He started working on the thermostat but, when asked how much longer it would take (around 8PM), the technician said that he was almost done but that we wouldn't be able to get heat because ""the lines were backwards."" The technician was getting ready to leave our residence, knowing that we had no heat. My husband asked him to replace the original thermostat as it would be about 32 degrees and we have four children (two 8-year olds, one 6-year old, and a 6-month old). He worked on the original thermostat for about half an hour and then left our residence without notice. The heat was not connected to the thermostat and the thermostat was hanging off of the wall when he left. After multiple attempts to contact Xfinity/Comcast, we were unable to get another technician to our residence and it was unclear whether or not they would bill us for the ""service."" They also refused to provide a name or ID for the technician so we could file a formal complaint. My husband was on hold for almost an hour and a representative disconnected the call twice. We had to call an emergency service to fix our thermostat and hook it up to the heat which costed $75."
"Janice of Mobile, AL",42086,1,"I signed up 6 months ago for a TV-Internet bundle from Comcast for $80 a month for 2 years. When I first signed up, I asked the guy, ""Now, this is going to stay $80 a month for 2 years, right? No going up on the price or any surprise fees being tacked on?"" ""Oh, no, it'll stay $80 a month for 2 years, no surprises,"" I was told. Skip forward 6 months, my bill goes to $105. I call Comcast, what the heck? ""Well, your DVR fee was a special promotion that ended at 6 months, we're sorry no one told you that."" Am seriously considering cutting the cord, just going to internet. DirecTV was more expensive, but in 7 years, never had a problem with customer service or deceitful practices from them. Comcast Sucks!!"
"John of None, KS",42082,1,"I have called Comcast on July 05, 2013 coz my internet and phone have been going up and down on a daily basis. The story is that I called them but I surprised that the customer rep she was not able to speak English! Then I asked her to transfer my call to another rep, she laughed and kept my call on hold 5 minutes. Another rep his name ** asked me what the problem is, he was very rude. After I explained my issue he said, ""Nothing we can do right now!"" Later on he kept me on hold and transferred my call to another rep. Again I said the same thing and said they will send a tech the next day. On the next day nobody came so I called again but the rep said that it can be fixed from the system!! After that I asked him to talk to the supervisor but he kept me on hold so I hanged. Later on I sent a mail to the same mail that was sent to me when I made my contract but no reply. It is really bad experience with this company! WHY THEY ARE DOING LIKE THAT??"
"Sandra of Philadelphia, PA",42082,1,"I talked to a representative Feb 11th and asked her for Double Play (internet and TV). The rep started to tell me that they had great promotions. I told her my pay limits were up to $120 a month. She started saying that she was doing something special for me and that there was a plan with home security, telephone, internet and TV package and all in the price I was looking for; plus she said that she will waive installation fees, send me a $200 gist card and it was not a contract. At that point I said, ""Wow what a great deal.""The 19th of February the guys came in and installed the services and I they asked me to sign a contract, also my bill went from $119 to $185, then from $185 to $354 in just the first 2 weeks. That day my nightmare began. I called every single day since the 19th of February, people from customer services, customer solutions, billing all hung up on me and they did not care about anything at all. It was the worst experience ever. I tried, in every single call, explaining I got services I did not ask for and to listen to the call which has every single piece of the promises made by that sales rep that day (I gave them name, number, time of the call, length of the call). I had promises of managers and/or supervisors calling back and nothing ever happened. When day I called 10 times and the ten times I was hung up on. I never imagined Comcast was going to be so horrible. I returned all the equipment, no one cared."
"Bryan of Jupiter, FL",42081,1,"We just signed up for Xfinity high speed internet. We have had service for grand total of one week and we have had our second problem with internet issues and have had to call twice already. Today, we have no cable service on TV and no internet because connected to same splitter. Tech will be out on Friday at 1Š—_ ItŠ—Ès Wednesday!!! Two days without internet OR TV... We have been a customer for 10+ yrs and have had repeated TV issues. This is just the latest. We have been on hold for 30+ minutes on phone twice now. Really is a joke. Transferred to billing and back to another geography and back and forth."
"J. E. of Kentwood, MI",42081,1,"Comcast implemented a price increase on our internet package.

"tricia of Woodstock, GA",42081,1,"Been dealing with this for over 3.5 months, have logged over 180 hours within that time to Comcast and no help or resolutions as of yet... 3.5 months ago receive bill from Comcast that is $550 over normal due to ""data overages"". Yes there are caps of 250 gb monthly but this constitutes over 127,000 GB being used by a single person with one computer, one tv and one cell phone (at&t). I have never streamed a movie, nor play games, never uploaded music etc., immediately call and inquire. Billing points out that three courtesy credits given already and why wasnŠ—Èt I aware?? Because the ""robo"" notification I am supposed to receive is not going to my correct phone #, although billing attest they have the correct #. CS is standing by the fact that the robo calls went to a cell phone no longer owned by me for over 2 years. So I call troubleshooting who is of no help. No sending out a tech to see if router is good, no walking me thru seeing how many devices are on my router, no comparison of monthly usage whereas normally I use less than 50gb in a month. Am told they are working on a ticket which a month later their solution was to correct my phone #. The tech that originally installed the new equipment happened to be my neighbor, since fired from Comcast and moved out 2 mos ago, but his buddies who still live there told me he often left a small door open in security and accessing neighbor's wifi... while he only installed mine on block. He was often ""troubleshooting"" neighbors equipment on off time. I got directed to them after finding out that when turning off all my devices and getting into router, there were 9 devices still listed. So I report this to Comcast, who does nothing.... no tech sent out, no discussions with CS and doesn't even get annotated in a file till January. Once finding out wifi is being used by others, immediately took actions to correct and no problems since but once again with no tech support and have spent the last 3.5 months with tickets opened that go nowhere, another 200 in connection/dis fees, and at least 2-4 hours every fifth day to get reconnected while these supposed tickets are under review. CS has even informed twice that everyone's first data overage credit is never shown on any bill, and one of my points was that regardless of who used data, my third credit should have been the 550. So how would any customer actually know how many times they exceeded data limit as the first credit is not annotated anywhere? So as a last ditch effort try the online help... Spent another 3 hours three nights ago, yet another escalated ticket opened with guarantees to be contacted within 48 hours. 48 hours go by, get back online requesting status of ticket only to be told ""something"" was sent to my personal email address and guess what, they send it to my email with all caps and I never get it. So another escalation ticket gets opened up tonight and services have been off for 5 days and counting.. So Comcast list of issues, notifications never received, no help or support identifying problem and or correcting, billing hours involving ""third"" courtesy credit, sending out questionable tech for installations and for all this joy they want almost 900 dollars in overages/disconnects and I have had no service for 5 days"
"Katherine of Grand Rapids, MI",42080,1,"I had internet through Comcast and was fairly happy with it. However my roommate was interested in trying out TV through them as well. In February, we upgraded our service and ordered the self-install kit. It took almost 2 weeks to get to our residence, they did not even ship it until exactly 7 days after the initial order date. When we received the equipment, the HDMI ports were literally covered up with a sticker and service reps on the phone refused to believe that this could be possible. Finally, they sent out a technician who saw our boxes, was baffled, and explained they must have been faulty. He was very nice and got us new equipment from his truck. The TV was finally working however we were unhappy with the service. Assuming (apparently wrongly) that I was still covered under the money-back guarantee, I call Comcast to downgrade my service back to the internet and after we finally get it worked out. The service rep. says ""oh by the way, you're not covered"" because the change was made to the account 31 days ago. Here's my problem, not only are we being charged for the shipment of the faulty boxes ($9.95), they are also charging us for the technician visit ($39.95) which was only necessary because they sent us faulty equipment! Now, I find out that even though our service didn't get set up until 14 days ago, we have to cover the entirety of what is now a $168 bill."
"Joanell of Atlanta, GA",42079,1,"I recently purchased Comcast in August of 2014. On March 11, 2014 my Comcast went down. After an hour of troubleshooting they explained that a technician would have to come to my house the following Wednesday. I told them that was unacceptable that I needed a security system. Comcast repeatedly lied about having someone come out sooner and after several days of I trying to cancel the service they told me although the error was Comcast fault I still would have to pay an early termination fee and still have to wait until a technician to come to my home. I have been hung up on twice, not able to get a direct number for the home security department since that is not option on the phone, lied by a customer service agent telling me that the phone doesn't work and putting in escalation tickets that aren't true."
"Wanos of Portland, OR",42078,1,"I worked for Comcast for a few years as a billing rep. There are a few customers who often call in to cheat the system, with things such as ""I didn't order that PPV"" etc. However, there are legit customer complaints. We in the billing department did our best to listen to their concerns and help them out. My boss at the time, ** (out of the Beaverton, Oregon office), said his sister called into Comcast to get service. They promised her free install charges, but when she received the bill, she was charged installation fees. All the stories we heard about shady sales reps was quite true. He was upset. I'm not sure what happened after that though. When I had quit Comcast for a different employer, I was helping my fianc’©e (poor college student) with her Comcast bills. We called to downgrade and were transferred a few times, and finally to their retention department. The retention rep promised they would lower the bill by about $25. The next bill that arrived did not reflect that. We called again and spoke with 2 people, one of whom used to be a coworker I knew in the Advocates department. They claimed there was absolutely no records of the call we made. We canceled the Comcast service in response. Not too long ago, I hear of Comcast's partnership with UPS. I drop off my model as the rules stated. I'm still being charged $12 a month for a modem fee half a year later. A few calls to them and we get nowhere, even when they have record that I switched out my own modem!!! Needless to say, an unrelated issue arose where I now have to file for bankruptcy so I stopped paying for Comcast (since I'm down to $150 in the bank anyways). I am surely going to include that evil company in my debt discharge list because that is the only way to fight their cheating unreturned equipment charge. I am currently using Internet from my phone and just using Netflix. I am unwavering and completely against supporting this malicious company financially in any way, shape or form. Accordingly, I will never, ever, purchase any products from them again or recommend them as a company to anyone at all, completely out of principle."
"Frank of Bonita Springs, FL",42075,1,"Called last week to complain about slow Internet (downloads about 1-2Mbs according to Bandwidthplace.com. After IDing myself to their IVR system, I repeated the info to a rep, Told about my problem. Asked all kinds of questions about the modem and router. Said that it was their equipment so they should know all about it. She couldn't help so transferred me to their ""Advanced"" support. Repeated all the ID info and then was asked about the problem. Said that they would try to fix and call back in two days.Obviously, no help so I called back and they scheduled a tech to come on Sat PM. He arrived on time and checked signal strength and said the problem is in their system. Service drop is old and loss is above their standard. He would write a work order to run new service drop and increase signal strength. As you might expect, no improvement so I repeated everything early this PM and will see their service tech on Sat PM. By almost any standard Comcast is the absolute worst company in America. I just wish that the money being spent in DC to get the merger through was spent on improving infrastructure. We can only hope... "
"Jamie of Modesto, CA",42073,1,"For the last 6 months the internet is constantly going down and when you call customer service you are on hold forever and all they do is tell you, ""Yes an outage has been reported"" and claim to credit your account but have nothing about the constant outages! If I ran my business like this I would be shut down! Where is the accountability? This company is horrible. They always tell you ""Oh the outage should be resolved in 2 to 4 hours or more!"" Then you get a call or text saying it's resolved and you try your internet and it is still down??? One time the customers service guy told me it's because a lot of people in my area are streaming and it slows the internet down??? What the heck how can this be ok?? I would never recommend Comcast. They are just as bad if not worse than AT&T......."
"rosa of Atlantic City, AL",42072,1,"I have been a Comcast customer for over 15 years. Customer service have declined. I had appointment March 5, 2015. They never showed nor did they give me a courtesy call. I called, inquiring about the technician. She told me he had to cancel Due to the weather. I ask the women, ""Why didn't anyone call and inform me?"" She said they did. I told her, ""No one called,"" so she reschedule for the next day. I am waiting and waiting so I called. She said, ""They're running late. They're coming."" Another no show. I called and insisting on speaking with management. She put me on hold for forty five minutes only to get back on the phone to tell me her supervisor was too busy to answer the complaint...he would call back. The supervisor never called back. I work from home so I lost money because of this. This company is horrible. I think the problem is the language barrier."
"Claire of Nashville, TN",42072,1,"I've had Comcast for almost 2 years due to there not being any other options in my area. I haven't had major problems aside from random charges and increases on my bill. For the past month and a half, however, my internet stopped working completely. We had the basic Internet package of 25 Mbps. I would call every few days and they would ""reset the connection"", only for it to work for a few hours then stop again. They had no open appointments for almost 2 weeks for a tech to come out.When he finally did, he spent an hour working on our modem but only changed out a cord. I ran an Internet speed test through both the Comcast and Geek Squad sites (which took forever to load) before he left and both told me the Internet speed was about 5 Mbps. I asked the tech to check out the modem again and he finally got it to 12 Mbps but only when the Ethernet cord was plugged in. He told me, verbatim, ""You aren't ever guaranteed wifi, only Internet when you have the Ethernet cord plugged in."" REALLY?My roommate has a MacBook air which doesn't even have an Ethernet outlet. He basically said that was the best he could do and left. The Internet worked for about 2 days and then stopped again. I called back only to be on the phone for an hour and a half, transferred 7 times (because no one could figure out what was wrong), and then was told, ""The Internet appears to be working properly from our end but we could send a tech out for $70 to take a look at it"". I continually asked to be transferred to a rep in the US because I couldn't understand what they were saying and kept trying to get me to upgrade to an Internet bundle with home phone service. Who even has a home phone anymore? I was only connected to a U.S. rep when I told them I wanted to cancel my service, which I did. I also was told I wouldn't pay for the Internet for the time it was out which they had documented due to my numerous calls, but guess what? My bill doesn't reflect any type of price adjustment. I will NEVER use this excuse for a company again and would rather flush my money down the toilet than pay for their non-working crap. It's a shame they can get away with treating customers the way they do."
"Carry of Hyde Park, MA",42071,1,"I called Comcast to up my internet speed. They told me I would have to pay 12/month for 50 mps. I did not know I was only getting 25 mps with my regular service. I tested my upload/download speed with their utility and I wasn't getting anything better than 32 mps. I called support and spent a total of 10 hours on two calls with tech support. The second call I was transferred 6 times. On the first call, the tech kept saying they could not see my device online so I was not connected to the internet. I told them I was on a VOIP line so it was impossible that I wasn't connected to the internet. This conversation went on for 30 min. I was on a 30 day trial for a new contract. I had been a customer for 17 yrs. They were going to send out a technician but I insisted that I not be charged for this visit no matter what the outcome. No one would commit to that so I canceled the visit. On the day that the visit was supposed to be canceled a guy shows up at my door saying he is with Xfinity home security. He explained that he traveled 2 hours to get to my house and had paperwork that said I called. I told him we don't have the security package, never did. He sat with me for almost an hour and agreed that this was all a major blunder but said to go ahead with the new product installation as I was dropping Comcast and if I wanted to come back he would personally handle the contract. I said fine and the following week had their major competitor installed. Since install I have consistently had 58-63 mps with the internet and that's with 4 laptops, 1 Ipad and two phones. In addition, the competitor bundle of internet, TV and phone is 15$/month cheaper than what I had been paying for all three. Also, I have HD coming in on my TV which I did not have with Comcast. Have to admit that the new service does have less channels but for the price and service it is worth it. Besides, we don't watch a lot of TV anyway."
"s. g. of Milltown, NJ",42071,1,"We moved in here 4 months back. First our modem was connected to someone else address for more than a month and it took them nearly 1 month to fix it and send someone. Then it continuously goes off 20 times during in a day. As a consumer we don't have a choice as Optimum is not a provider here, only Comcast. Why is monopoly allowed?We had Optimum previously in our other previous town and they are the best. They will be there to fix anything within an hour even during Sunday. When there was no power they put a battery to make the Internet work. Now that is what I call service. Comcast really don't care as they know you do not have much choice except get internet from them. I am not sure what the councilors and Mayors are doing about this kind of monopoly."
"Robert of Portland, OR",42070,1,I helped a friend set up a Comcast service. She's had service with them for over fifteen years and pays 180 dollars a month and they never cut her a break. I have a different carrier and I was using my phone to try to set things up. Now when I try to log on to my wifi at home it takes me to xfinity.com and I have centurylink. I want to cut off my connection with Comcast.
"Robin of Fort Myers, FL",42185,2,"After filing a complaint with https://www.fcc.gov/ & better business bureau I received a call and was credited for my entire account less the 150.00 I paid in advance. I am satisfied with these results. It's sad I have to go to these lengths to correct issue. ** Executive Office Number! If you need it but no help unless you file a complaint with link above. Then you will see results.Original ReviewSigned up for X1 Blast package not quite 2 weeks ago. Was told install was free & I would not receive a bill until 30 days after I started my service. I was told install tech would be here the next day between 5 & 7 pm. I was given my phone number and paid my deposit for all 3 service.The day of the install I received a call saying something went wrong on their end and they would have to reschedule my install for 2 days later. I was not happy with that. I was able to get the next day instead, so I was ok with it. They had to run my deposit again. I confirmed that the phone number they gave me was still going to be the same as original they gave me. I explained I was ordering new card & t-shirts with the new number and wanted to make sure there was no chance of the number being different. I was assured that the number was the same. So I placed my order.The next day when tech showed up I was informed that the number was a different number! After about 4 phone calls and almost 3 hours on the phone with I forget how many different operators trying to get a supervisor, because the operators did not have the authority to correct the number. I just spent 1000.00 on my order! I could not change it due to a mistake on my end. The Supervisor was able to correct it! I was very happy.Not even 2 weeks go by and I get a email from Xfinity saying my video bill was due???? So I watch it and I'm thinking maybe a tutorial on my video bill. WRONG!!! IT WAS A BILL!!! I had a bill over $200.00. It is only supposed to be 112.00 including tax a month. I was charged an additional 39.95 for the installer to show up and 40.00 for hooking 2 cable lines to 2 box's 20.00 a box! So install was 89.95. My house was already wired and ready. I was also charged for half a month's service and tax. I called and was informed that the info the 1st operator told me was not true that they always bill 2 weeks after service and I would get another bill in a few days for a full month service. That on occasions they do offer free install but it was not in my notes. So there was no chance of getting that removed from my bill. I requested that they pull the recording of my conversation with the original representative. I was told it was possible that it was not recorded. HMMM... Imagine that!!She said she would put in a request for her manager to remove the $40.00 but the manager was off till Monday, it was Friday. I was also told that if it was removed it would come off the next bill statement not the current one. She recommended I pay it all now. That the next bill may be adjusted! She said she would call me Tuesday to let me know the decision. It is now Saturday and I have already received another email telling me my bill was due AGAIN! I just got the first bill yesterday! It is not even due till for another 10 days! I am awaiting the call on Tuesday. Will update this on outcome!"
"Brea of Greenwood, LA",42070,1,"My comcast internet drops connection every 30 mins to an hour. This has been going on for 2 years.

Every time I call in they make promises of fixing the issue but no tech ever shows up. They have charged me for the 1st 2 techs last year ""which they did not fix problem"", charged me for mailing me new cable boxes but when the techs showed up said I didn't need them and took the boxes with them. I've had promises and rudeness when I call in"" which is at least 2 to 3 times a month begging for help with these issues"".

"Lee of Sarasota, FL",42068,1,"Comcast/Xfinity SUCKS!! ** should be fired on the spot! I didn't leave the chat, This dumbass ** closed the chat!! This is like the 3rd time going to Live Chat with NO RESOLUTION!!!! Xfinity SUCKS!!! Plus, their internet speed is SOOO SLOW compared to FIOS. I already have business FIOS and they couldn't even get my xfinity modem to work, which the first guy said it should work anyways. I just got sent a new modem to me today from them and it still don't work. The month since I ordered is ticking away and yet to even get any internet service from XFINITY. I'll make sure to make a blog post, so I can leave a review for others to read."
"Ted of Riviera Beach, FL",42067,1,"In the beginning...There was installation. I was quoted one price and charged $40 more. This was mitigated by the installer being 4 hours late and being credited $20 against the $40 they overcharged me. So I moved from a condo with free basic DirecTV that I upgraded with pay channels and a DVR, then went through a local company for internet access (great access from a fly-by-the-night ISP, I clocked them at 70+mbs).I moved to a condo that offered free basic Xfinity (Comcast) TV. So (even after past miserable experiences) to go with the free stuff...who wouldn't! So I got it installed (as described above). I will say that the internet and wireless access has been flawless for two months (color me shocked!). But this DVR is crap! It's slow, laggy, and the controls are counter-intuitive. When something doesn't work as expected and you keep pressing the ""OK"" button (because of the God awful lag), it deletes your program! I'd kill to have my DirecTV DVR back. It worked exactly as you expect. Comcast has obviously cut too many corners on hardware."
"Fancy of Miramar, FL","Feb. 28, 2015",1,"I have consistently called Comcast about a misrepresentation of a promotional product. I was told one thing but given something else. I called 3 times and the calls ended with they will have someone call me. Nothing. The new modem was not working properly and my internet was interrupted. I placed a service call and a technician came and spent 5 minutes to fix the problem and 40 minutes on his phone. I jokingly say that I hope I'm not being charged for this time. He laughed. Here we are a month later, I am charged a $60 wiring fee. I called to dispute the charges and I was told someone would call me back. Nothing. I called again today and was advised the technician declared it was a valid charge. When I asked to speak with the tech dept, I was told they don't speak with customers. I asked to speak with a supervisor - none available. Go figure. The customer rep says ""ma'am just to let you know this charge is a valid charge and will not be removed sorry"". This is ridiculous that a tech could write whatever he wants and customers just have to deal with it. Worst company."
"Mariza of Chicago, Other","Feb. 28, 2015",1,"The Internet and cable services are down since Friday, and all we hear is promises. They are lying to our faces, promising they will come since this morning. Since this morning, we talked to at least 6 different people and they pretend they never received a phone call. Every time you call, they say they do not know what we are talking about. We have saved all the confirmation numbers that could verify the basic facts of our claim."
"Jason of Lowell, MA","Feb. 25, 2015",2,"First off, the fact that their product wasn't working properly was already a bad start and secondly, terrible customer service just ruined the whole mood. HereŠ—Ès what happened. My Internet was not working properly and when I had called the customer service, they were absolutely wonderful - treated me with respect and all. But here comes the bad part. They directed me to the Advanced Wireless Department and some whacko picks up the phone half-awake answering the phone with a very dreadful ""Hello?"" Very professional (Sarcasm). So I was telling him about what was happening with my Internet and halfway in, I hear the guy yawn and hang up the phone! The worst part about it is that this guy might be doing this to OTHER customers with no punishment whatsoever. Goes to show Comcast hires some very bad workers. Disappointed."
"Michele of Olathe, KS","Feb. 24, 2015",1,"The only reason I am giving Comcast a one star review is because I don't have the option of giving them none. We have been customers for 17 years. In recent years, we have experienced enormous problems with our service. Just like the previous reviewer, we were roped into the Triple Play package and blatantly lied to about what it consisted of. Our home phone never worked, cable was going out routinely, and internet would go down. We finally eliminated the phone ""service"" and were charged out the yin yang for doing so. We kept the cable and internet. One day I went to log onto my email and it told me the password was incorrect. I knew it wasn't, but when I tried to change it and it asked for my secret question, it wouldn't accept the answer that I know was correct. I spent a grand total of SIX hours, for three days straight, on the phone with Comcast customer ""service"". Every time they would reset the account and I would create new passwords, it would lock me out again the next day. After getting four different customer service reps on the line, I finally got one who transferred me to a supervisor. He immediately got on the phone and told me that he couldn't help me change my password because I was not an ""authorized"" user. Not an authorized user? The account is in my husband's name with me listed as an authorized user and has been for 17 years. He uses AOL email. I gave them all identifying information, to include social security numbers and he still wouldn't assist me. As a result, I was unable to access email and had to deal with angry customers because I was unable to respond to them. Can you say furious? My husband was so livid, he called them back and, of course, they showed me as an authorized user. We dumped Comcast within 48 hours. You can't understand half of what the customer service reps say, they don't know what they're doing, and equally as important, their services are completely unreliable. Shame on these incompetent bozos! They lost customers of almost two decades that paid in excess of $300 for services. Joke of a company. I do mean joke. Don't waste your time or hard earned dollars. Go with a provider that knows how to hire, train, and run a company. Horrible organization."
"joe of Grand Rapids, MI","Feb. 23, 2015",1,"Had the worse experience that I had with any company or anyone!!! Can't talk to anyone on the phone and when you do it does no good because they DO NOT do anything they say they will. Almost doubled my rate that they (supposedly) signed me up for. You have to take the equipment back to THEM as they say they will not pick it up. They can pick it up out of my dumpster if they want it - I will treat them like they treated me.I'm canceling this lousy, lying, two-faced, sorry excuse for a business and going to Triton. Comcast also lies to you about how many megabytes you need to have to order so as to attempt to drive folks toward the higher priced Mbps and Triton offers 8 Mbps (more than most any company needs) that they guarantee will do me better than Comcast's 105 Mbps @ over a 100 bucks where Triton charges 29.95 per month with a 50.00 one time installation and this is a month to month agreement rather than having to sign up to Comcast for much longer periods of time. SO I SAY COME AND GET YOUR CRAP EQUIPMENT BECAUSE YOU ARE HISTORY TO ME AND I HOPE ANYONE WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE GETTING INVOLVED WITH THIS RIPOFF COMPANY!!!!!"
"dan of Washington, DC","Feb. 23, 2015",1,"We decided to upgrade our cable to HD and increase our internet speed. Comcast scheduled us with a technician to install the new x1 cable box and upgraded modem. When the technician arrived he setup the new box but did not bring a new modem. After he left our internet stopped working and I could not access the HD channels, when I select an HD channel it tells me to call and subscribe. The entire point was to upgrade to HD. Now I have no internet and still no HD. I called Comcast and after 2.5 hours and being transferred 7 times. I still have no internet and my HD channels still do not work. To top it all off they want to charge me to have another technician come out. Not sure why I deal with this company, except they are the only cable provider available."
"Rita of Atlanta, Other","Feb. 19, 2015",1,"Admittedly I have never had an issue with Comcast in the past, but today I spoke with several employees and didn't run into a problem until I asked for a tech to come out to my home and fix what were apparently unable to do in several hours of phone conversation and virtual ""tech support"". There is only so much of that you can do, if it's just not working. I'm a tech savvy person and I had reached the end of my patience for something that was supposed to be ""easy"". I was told the fee would be waived and I was being transferred.That happened and all hell broke loose. This woman raised her voice, said she'd have to charge me, and that ""she does this all day long"". I asked for her manager and she said she'd ""transfer"" me. She hung up on me instead. I called back, he made me troubleshoot some more, then begrudgingly said a tech could come by Sat. . it's Wed. This is totally unacceptable. I can't wait until Google Fiber comes and breaks up this monopoly."
"Carol of Boulder, CO","Feb. 18, 2015",2,"I have had Xfinity/Comcast for years and have been pretty happy. A few weeks ago I noticed a channel had disappeared and so I called to find out why. The employee proceeded then to sell me more services since it wouldn't cost me too much more money than what I was paying. Well, the equipment arrived and when it wouldn't automatically work I contacted Xfinity again. This employee shared what this new stuff was going to cost me and so I cancelled.So, a few hours later I had no cable and called again. This person got the cable working but unbeknownst to me he reset what I had just cancelled. So, I returned the equipment and saw my bill a day ago and contacted them again since the bill was over 200% what I had been paying. So, he helped me out but told me to call customer service to finalize everything. I did. But, instead of finalizing my cancellation he proceeded to try and sell me the same thing I had already cancelled twice. WTH is going on here?"
"Andrew of Longmont, CO","Feb. 15, 2015",1,"If anyone thinks that Comcast is not aware of what they are doing, they are deluding themselves. Utter genius to create a monopoly selling a product that does not work, in fact, gets progressively worse, then sell ""upgrades"" to improve service (which do not work either). This is exactly why net neutrality is so vital. These corporate criminals will not react to any of our consumer pleas so long as they can extort profits from us for peddling garbage, unchecked and unregulated."
"Dexter of Bloomington, IN","Feb. 14, 2015",1,"Boy what a day. First, a Comcast guy shows up at our door and tells me he needs $223.00 or he is going to collect my modem. I explained to him that I owned the modem and he would not be taking it. I asked why he wanted $223 and he told me our bill had not been paid since October. Interesting, since we do direct payment through IU credit union. Bernice got online and transferred the data from IU to a note pad and we showed this to him. I also explained that we have two accounts in Bernice's name and if he would check, the excess money would be under that account and that Comcast had many times in the past, applied all of the payments to one account and then showed the other account past due.He wouldn't even look into it and told me our service would be disconnected. OK, so I took both bills to Comcast, waited in line to see the lady behind the counter, and finally after 30 minutes, got to talk to someone who I thought might get this corrected. I explained to her what was wrong and sure enough she checked and found an excess of $308 on the second account which is Bernice's sister's account that we also pay. So I said, ""there you have, just transfer that money over to the other account."", ""I can""t do that"". WHAT? She showed me a printout and told me I needed to show her which payments needed to be transferred. I told her I would need to be looking at our computer to be able to do that, and asked for her phone number so Bernice could call her. She told me she couldn't give me her phone number. So what do I do? Her response, ""I DON'T KNOW"".My next comment was, ""I am paying you for a service, you have my money, your records even show that you have my money, and you can't transfer my money to the correct account, because Comcast applied it to the wrong account. Ma'am, do you understand that is theft of service, a criminal offense?"" Well she really didn't care, and she got huffy with me. This is what our country has come to, a big corporation makes a mistake and then refuse to correct it, and they just don't care about a customer who has paid their bill since 1999."
"walter of Palm Coast, FL","Feb. 11, 2015",1,"Ordered just internet service and wireless hot spots. Stopped working immediately way before I could even get my cable modem sent to me. Called in to fix and technical support either could not figure out the problem, or hung up on me, or passed me around to different departments. I stayed on the phone waiting for hours always to be hung up on or told to call back the next day and it would be fixed. Never happened. I even was given case numbers but that did not help. Then they send me the wrong cable modem and I had to drive to a store to exchange it myself as it did not work. Then back to endless hours on the phone and being passed around and hung up on.I escalated to supervisors several times that promised me they would fix the issue but no luck. I even gave up and just tried to cancel my service all together at that point (3 times) but the reps are so incompetent they could not even complete that (got passed to different departments then hung up on again). It took over 2 weeks and this is not an exaggeration, 20+ phone calls to finally get someone who knew what to do and finally get me up and running. This person 'Ricardo' agreed I was treated unfairly and said he would definitely have billing adjust my account so I would not be charged for 2+ weeks of service I did not have and hours of frustration on the phone. He assured me he put in the proper notes and requests to adjust my billing. Well sure enough when the bill came absolutely no discounts and I was charged way more than I should have been. This by far has been the worst customer support from a corporation I have ever experienced in my life. I have never dealt with a company so dysfunctional, disorganized, and clueless about such a simple thing as activating an internet account. I would gladly pay more for a much slower service if there was one around but Comcast/Xfinity seems to have the monopoly on this area in Jacksonville where I just moved to. What I learned is most people have such a difficult time with this company as well so something should be done about their poor service."
"Crissi of Indianapolis, IN","Feb. 10, 2015",1,"I set up internet through Comcast when I moved to a new place. It didn't work for almost 2 weeks and when they finally sent someone, they charged me $39.95 for it and refused to remove it from my account. Even though I was told it would be free and even though it was their equipment outside that didn't work! I had to fight with them to get a credit for the couple weeks that it didn't work. Every time I've been on the phone with them and asked them to note my account, the rep leaves something totally different! Finally, today the customer service rep told me that ""I should have to pay for the technician because internet is luxury, not a utility"" and that it was my choice to have the service installed. I've had my fill with them once and for all. Switching to AT&T. They aren't much better, but hell I'm finding out anything is better than Comcast these days!"

Well we chewed them out and what do you know we haven't had Internet problems since but our cable is bad. Today we went to do a down grade on our cable because we needed to cut expenses, because our rent went up. They said that they were going to charge us a ""cancellation fee""! We told them we are not cancelling just reducing. They said that our contract is for what we have right now and that we can only up-grade but cannot down grade. Well at the end of the school year, our son is home schooled, we are just going to stop paying them. We don't care about our credit because it is already bad because my husband kept losing jobs because of his disability, but now he has his SSD. We are just going to take our laptop to our local library for Internet, get a digital converter for TV, and we have Safe Link for our phone so we will save tons of money once we get rid of this joke of a company."

This was magnified as my call was repeatedly ""dropped"" and I had to start over with reps who were patronizing and difficult to understand at times. They passed me from person to person until I finally insisted they send someone to solve the problem, thereby avoiding being passed on interminably thru the system without solving the problem."
"Matthew of Nowhere, KY","Feb. 5, 2015",1,"I signed up for Comcast Internet when I moved into my new home, and was overjoyed to have fast internet again after being without it for a few months. I signed up for their 50mbps Blast! plan, and had a tech come install it, but used my own modem. Everything was just fine until 7 days in, I received an e-mail from Comcast warning me that I was near my ""data cap"". I was utterly confused and immediately logged in to my account to find out what it was referring to. I had never even HEARD of any company having a data cap on their internet service.Sure enough, 7 days in, I was at 268 GB out of the 300 GB allowed. I instantly saw red. I did some research and was horrified to learn of their data cap policies and getting charged overages. I wasn't even using what I considered a large amount of data. Even with their highest internet tier, the cap is only 600 GB. with 50+ mbps, that is frighteningly simple to surpass in just days. All of the information I acquired about their cap was from forums. There was little to no useful information on their actual website to better inform me as to what my options were.I don't understand how it is even legal to instill such an abysmal cap in the first place, much less not make you aware of such a thing until you are virtually past it. This data cap combined with TERRIBLE customer service, almost daily e-mails reminding me about my bill (which obviously was never paid), and other shady tactics they use to rob people of hundreds of dollars, forced me to switch to a company with a substantially lower internet speed. I have no data cap however, and am still perfectly able to use the internet for everything I need/want on a daily basis. My opinion is that everyone else should do the same to give Comcast and companies like them to put an end to this kind of nonsense, and actually serve their customers, instead of mistreat/cheat them. AVOID COMCAST AT ALL COSTS!"
"Praveen of Walnut Creek, CA","Feb. 5, 2015",1,"The very first time, when I moved to new apartment, I scheduled an appointment and they came 2 hr after the scheduled time. Then they fixed a router that was dropping wifi connection all the time, and later turned out to be faulty (there was also numerous references online about the issue with that model). I scheduled another appointment, as I was not able to use it coz of Comcast issue. But they charged me like some $100. Later when I called customer care and complained, they waived that off. After replacing the equipment in the second visit, it went fine for some time. Then new issue popped up - very frequent loss of connection and the router was going offline. Troubleshooted with remote support for more than 20 times. Their remote support is the most worthless support I have seen from many service providers. Only thing they can do is remote restart and finally asking us to manually reset the router. Two times, onsite technician came and fixed some issue with their outside switches and boxes, and it started working fine for few months. Then issue resurface again. Only thing I continue with Comcast is there is no other real alternative."
"Amanda of Burlington, WA","Feb. 5, 2015",1,"I have had an account with these morons since June! I have had to call twice a month because either my Internet isn't working, or I've been overcharged! I have been so disrespected by their customer service on every call! At one point, they said I didn't have access to my own account! I've had to get a lawyer and they found that I was being overcharged and were suppose to credit my account! I had to fight for months for that to happen! Now they are trying to charge me for what they credited me, stating I didn't pay my bill in October, which is how they insisted on crediting me the overcharges! I have a bundle package of 99$, every single month my bill is different, jumping from 99 to 145 to 215. One month, they tried to bill me over 400$ every time I have been charged for a bundle and the Internet and TV service. Am I the only one who knows what bundle means?? All I want is to pay for a service that I signed up for and have it work at least 85% of the time. I have been offered free Internet for a year, free Channels, but then when my bill comes, it doesn't show these promises. I call and they say it never happened!!! I ask for all calls to be recorded and ask that corporate contacts me, but it falls on deaf ears! The customer service managers even tell me they don't have corporate's number?!? I've never in my 32 yrs had a company harass, disrespect and mistreat me!!! When is someone going to do something about this? How many bad reports do u need???"
"Patricia of St Paul Park , MN","Jan. 28, 2015",1,"Comcast sent out a letter to notify me of a new modem upgrade. We ordered it to be mailed out at the end of Nov. We never received it and then received an automated message the end of Dec saying ""call to order your new modem."" Never once did they say we would lose our service, yet since mid-January we very rarely have any service at all. Now the company tells me they will send someone out to install the new modem and update my boxes for $100. Otherwise the company will mail it out for me. I was next transferred to the person who would set me up to receive the modem by mail when she tells me I have to pay $15 for them to mail me out a new modem which they mandate I get. The letter, call and the person I spoke to just before Marcela said it was free to mail it to me and I install it. So, Comcast would like to charge me for doing their job of installing and exchanging their outdated equipment and I should pay for the 6 to 10 days that I do not have service. Yep, that is the way Comcast does business."

I only have internet & a land line. I heard all the spiel on how I was in a time line of a 2 year contract, 2014. B.S. I've only had it for one year. No employee could tell me what happened to the other year? My bill went up regardless. I hate cable company monopolies. We are all going to come up short in the end."
"phol of Pot Lucie, FL","Jan. 28, 2015",1,"We started with Comcast. 3 weeks later an installer had the chance to come out. He left with only 2 bedroom boxes on basic cable working. We called them repeatedly for the issue. Never had internet or the channels in our package. A week later they send a tech that got our master bedroom working on cable and internet. After peaking in the attic where they were working I noticed one of my roof trusses laying there. Guess he didn't have time to reinstall it. They offered nothing to us. I had to repair the remaining two cable outlets myself that weren't working because the tech sent out disconnected them to make only two rooms operate on basic. Xfinity is awful. We still have not received our original offer. If you have any other provider, choose wisely. We are in central Florida. Good luck."
"jeff of Indianapolis, IN","Jan. 27, 2015",1,"Well started in 2013 around July/June when they was upgrading my service. Started getting service breaks intermittently, probably made over 50 calls, can't count how many ""techs"" came into my home to replace my modem. Replaced everything in the home and to the pole, still no difference. I have a couple of supervisors #s but they won't call you back. When it rains I can barely connect, which I told all of these people this and they still can't find the problem or they just don't care!!! "
"Josiah of Carlisle, PA","Jan. 27, 2015",1,"I took over the lease on an apartment from another tenant recently. I also took over her Comcast Internet service contract. We both filled out the forms to transfer the account to my name. Unfortunately while Comcast transferred the account to my name they didn't bother to change the address or contact info, or the user name or password for the account so the bills kept going to the old tenant but at her new address and when I tried to access the account online to change things I couldn't get access. I tried contacting them by phone and spent almost an hour going around in circles through their terrible automated phone system, which just can't seem to deal with a situation where the account number and phone number don't match the records (that was why I was calling after all). Once I actually got to talk to a real person they passed me off between 3 different people before I talked to someone who could actually figure out my problem. Fortunately I did eventually talk to an intelligent and helpful person but I took a very long time and lots of hassles. Now a few weeks later I am trying to log in online and discovering that they still haven't changed anything and I still can't get access online. When I tried getting to an online chat with a customer service rep I found that there was some sort of glitch with their online form so that I couldn't enter my zip code or phone number properly. Both of those are required fields so I couldn't access the online rep because of the glitch in their online system. I think I have gotten around that problem for now and I am just waiting (for over half an hour at this point) to get to the head of the queue for the customer service chat. I have dealt with many different cell phones, credit card, cable, and other sorts of services over the years and I have never seen such utterly inept, incompetent, useless, and careless customer service. It is clear that Comcast believes that they have a captive audience and could care less about serving their customers. Their Internet service has been mostly OK when it has been working, but it is never especially fast or great for the amount one pays for it, and if there is a problem well, God help you, because Comcast hardly will."
"Julie of Atlanta, GA","Jan. 27, 2015",1,"2 weeks ago, I set up my move with Comcast. I explained the dates to have my service disconnected, which was February 12th. They cut my internet off today. Apparently, someone in the departments changed my address and due to the same address being used by someone else, they were unable to reconnect my service. I spent well over 6 hours talking to different people who claim they would fix and they did not. When I was finally fed up and asked to cancel, they told me I wouldn't be able to cancel unless I called back the next day. The entire process was completely handled wrong, the customer service was beyond poor and at most times, rude."
"ko of Minneapolis, MN","Jan. 25, 2015",1,I have been screwed over twice now by Comcast and their Autopay malfunctioning and me having no idea why that would happen. It is unacceptable and their customer service people just blamed me for not understanding their systems! They are rude to their customers. I can't wait to find another internet service.
"Stephaine of Houston, TX","Jan. 23, 2015",1,Comcast/Xfinity is the worst company I have ever dealt with. We've had Xfinity the past five months and we've had nothing but problems. When I call them to have these problems fixed they act as if I am a hassle and a bother. Are you kidding me? I'm paying for nothing but garbage.
"Joann of Soith San Francisco, CA","Jan. 23, 2015",1,"Comcast wanted customers to upgrade their modems with their new ones. I did that. They mailed the new modem to me. It was a self install but I could not do it so I called and had them send a technician out to install and had to pay for that. That was fine but after that the WIFI in the modem never worked properly - I kept being drop while using my tablet or Netflix. I called for months regarding this. Comcast had me calling other places and doing things. Finally just before the Holidays I called Comcast once again and someone there said, ""Well let me check into something."" And whatever he did he informed me that the WIFI in the modem was defective and it needed to be replaced. They had to send another new modem. I told them at the time ""But I need someone again to come out and install it."" And I told them I did not want to pay a second time to have another one installed. Each time I spoke to the Service department and to billing and I made sure to check into it I was told there would not be a charge since it was due to Comcast's defective modem. Well lo and behold when I get my bill they not only charged me a 15.00 shipping for another modem they charged me a service charge for the technician a second time and taxes on top of everything. I called to speak with a supervisor and they were not going to credit me. Also saying no notes on my account which I thought very strange since there should have been many notes since I called them on many occasions. I finally was able to get a credit of 50.00 only on a 88.17 charge. I am very upset about this and will eventually change providers. Hoping AT&T will come my way asap. Beware, Comcast has terrible customer service and has no problem outright lying to a customer to turn around and get them in the back. Their price are also outrageous."
"Elise of Buford, GA","Jan. 23, 2015",1,"Worst company in the entire world, if you can avoid getting Comcast, do it. They have a data cap on their internet which limits you to 300GB. They say it's enough to stream a ton of movies/shows, but it isn't, especially not with more than 1 person using the internet in a house. I have to day in and day out make sure that I'm not streaming too many shows on Netflix, or Hulu, or watching too many YouTube videos because if I so much as go over 1 GB of data, I will be charged $10. Don't get me started on their customer services, they don't exist. All customer service is outsourced to India and none of them know anything about what you want and none of them care to help you out in the least. NEVER GET COMCAST."
"Daniel of Decatur, GA","Jan. 22, 2015",1,"The quick version: Comcast sent my bill to an email address they created and that I didn't even know existed, then disconnected my service for non-payment without any attempt to notify me. Trying to contact them resulted in more than an hour of making phone calls, most of which were disconnected by their system before I ever got to speak to a human being. We'll be using a T-Mobile hotspot for our in-home Internet from now on.The long version: We recently moved to the Atlanta area, and the only decent (price & speed) option for Internet service was Comcast/Xfinity. Having dealt with them before, we were less than pleased, but I work from home and decent speeds/data plans are important. So we bit the bullet and signed up. Here we are one month later, never received a bill, and wake up to find that our service has been disconnected for non-payment. We owe $70.90, says their website (the only site we can connect to using our WiFi). I, of course, want a breakdown of those charges and to see what the hell happened, so I try calling. That's when the real fun started.I tried several different 800 numbers that I found online (using my phone's hotspot to connect). Every single one of them had me enter all my identifying information multiple times, then disconnected me at the exact same point--before speaking to a human being, of course. I got a hold of a live chat operator (again, using my phone's data plan to connect) and got other numbers that were ""direct hotlines"" to the service and, eventually, the cancellation departments. They funneled me back to the same primary customer service lines where, again, I was disconnected.So, let's call the sales lines--they always answer, right? Disconnected twice, but eventually managed to speak to several sales representatives who were ""sorry, but they can't transfer me""--not to billing, not to cancellation. If I wanted to buy something more from Comcast they were happy to help, otherwise I was pretty much **.  After about an hour, I finally manage to get someone in cancellations. They tell me that my account is already in ""non-paid deactivation"" (remember, this is after one month of service, and I have NEVER RECEIVED A BILL) and they can't do anything. They can't even tell me what the $70.90 I supposedly owe them consists of; for that I need to speak to someone in billing.Finally get a hold of someone in billing (had to insist that the cancellation rep transfer me and stay on the line while I was being transferred to make sure I wasn't disconnected--she argued, but yelling at her for long enough actually worked). They tell me my bill was sent to @comcast.net account that they swear I set up but I very much did not, they simply took my Comcast username (which I had to set up) and made an email address without telling me, then sent my bill there. I insisted on a paper bill, and I was told that PAPER BILLS ARE AN EXTRA $5 CHARGE PER MONTH. Told him exactly what he could do with himself, and that was that.I'm typing this report using my phone's hotspot. I've already called T-Mobile, which has great service in this area and great customer service in general--we've been with them for more than a decade--and we'll be using a mobile hot spot with a high-tiered data plan for our in-home Internet. I'd rather pay a little (a VERY little) each month than give Comcast a single penny more.Comcast: You suck. You know you suck, because reports like this are posted all the time. Maybe you disconnect everyone who calls because you're tired of hearing about how much you suck, but I'll be posting this everywhere I can just to make sure you know how much you suck. (p.s. you suck)."
"Chris of Broadway, VA","Jan. 19, 2015",1,The tv shuts down every night and only thing they tell me is it's a required maintenance... I mean really do you have to reboot an entire WAN every night?
"Robert of Bloomington, IN","Jan. 18, 2015",2,"3 years now, number of receivers, WiFi routers, modems it's always the same result. Sometimes they work mediocre and sometime not all. What do you do? THROW more money down the drain with calling their service man or drive over to their office and get more of their faulty products. Bent over the barrel is right! I can't wait for dsl. Maybe their service will be faster than dial up????"
"John of Atlanta, GA","Jan. 17, 2015",1,"So I used to be pretty pleased with our comcast internet speeds, but it wasn't long before we started noticing slower connection speeds at peak hours rather than boosts in speeds, which we are being charged for. It's frustrating to be paying over $100 for an internet connection that won't even load a webpage. Oh, and you better hope you don't have an actual technical problem because they will bounce you around from call center to call center suggesting variations on turning off the router and turning it back on. Yes my router is on and yes I have power cycled it. Do you have any actual ""expert"" advice? No? Got it. They have a monopoly on the area I live in and no incentive to provide more reliable service or tech support. It's my fault for not checking to see if there were any other ISPs in the area. I also doubt you'll find a more reliable alternative though, because most ISPs treat their customers this way. So disappointing. Hopefully this will go through eventually if the page loads."
"chad of Alpharetta, GA","Jan. 16, 2015",1,"I tried to stay loyal for years with Comcast because they used to be somewhat fair. Now they are just extremely greedy. I have used another Internet provider for years. Called clear communications, which werenŠ—Èt the greatest but it was only $20.00 a month. Well every time I called into Comcast they would try to push their Internet on me. This one lady was so desperate for the sale she wouldn't take no for an answer and she tricked me by saying, ""Will you at least try it under no obligation?"" I was on vacation at the time and wanted to wait until I got home and advised her I would call back. She advised me that I needed to be put in that day to get the deal. She said the equipment wouldn't be sent until I returned home and called. I agreed and then I got home and called to tell them that I changed my mind and wasn't interested. They billed me every month for a year for the Internet and the equipment and I never had any equipment in my house or the Internet ever. I called every month for a year and spent hours and hours trying to get them to remove it. They would just talk over you or run you around in circles with some bogus excuse until you were exhausted. I continued to pay because I didn't want this to hit my credit. I then got so frustrated I stopped paying that portion of the bill until it was resolved. They just added late charges every month. I finally just stopped paying the bill and will dispute it later. I've had it with their bullying tactics and refusal of customer service. They are like Wal-Mart. Made all their money and now have most people brain washed that they have the cheapest product and then they slowly increase the price and throw in misc. charges. Comcast you have lost this customer forever. I will find another way!"
"Robert of Santa Cruz, CA","Jan. 16, 2015",1,"Comcast sells internet packages claiming they can provide up to 50mb/sec download speeds. Their own technicians have verified that Santa Cruz (where I live) does not have the network infrastructure to provide more than 17/ms download speed, and often less. I have complained to Comcast several times and received an $18 credit on my monthly bill of $120. They have no plans to correct the infrastructure problem. This fraudulent business practice affects thousands of customers in Santa Cruz."
"Stormy of Memphis, TN","Jan. 15, 2015",1,"On Sunday, Dec. 21, 2014, my internet suddenly went out. I was told that the problem was in the wiring and they would have to send a technician. What had happened was that my next door neighbor moved and instead of disconnecting her line, they disconnected mine. Not only was I without internet for two days (which I use for my work), they billed me for the call! The technician put some codes on the work order that said they made some changes to the wiring in my house. All they did was screw the cable back onto the box. I was standing there when he did it.When I called customer service they offered to waive half the fee, which tells me that they knew they had screwed up. When I told them that in essence they were billing me for their error, they said they could only go by what was on the paperwork (a copy of which the tech did not leave me). I went up two levels at customer service to a senior supervisor, who told me that if it was up to him he ""would bill me for the whole thing,"" because I'd taken up so much of his colleague's time. This is the second incident in less than a year that I have lost income due to Comcast. Two months ago my modem started failing and I had to take it to the branch for a replacement or pay for a service call for THAT. I've only had this service since April 11th -- less than a year!"
"mike of Anoka, MN","Jan. 14, 2015",1,"Purchased a one week pass for wifi. My service worked for one day. I made 9 more attempts to connect to wifi. I have cut contacted customer service 5 times. Comcast is finally admitted their website has errors. Comcast customer service has hung up on me, comcast has made very little effort into fixing the problem. I have received no phone calls or email to resolve the problems. Comcast has not issued an account number for my purchase. After 5 days I cannot get this problem resolved. Buyers beware. May use my email address as my account number. I will attach my receipt when I can get it off my email."

"Stephanie of Richmond, VA","Jan. 6, 2015",1,I called Comcast to fix my internet and phone when they went out a couple of weeks ago. They could not fix it over the phone so they scheduled an appointment to come to the house. The guy fixed the problem when he came but I was blindsided when the bill came and I had a $40.00 service charge. I was not informed before or during the appointment that there was going to be a charge. My cable bill is already close to $200.00 and I barely watch the TV. I called customer service (in the Philippines) and they tried to sell me a service plan on top of the $40.00 service charge!!! They are threatening to charge $350.00 if I cancel the service. Is this legal. I never had to pay for a service charge when I had Verizon. If it goes out again I am just going to be stuck because I do not have $40.00 to pay to have it repaired.
"Fara of Houston, TX","Jan. 4, 2015",1,"I have the performance package with Comcast. Internet only, one laptop, and I can not even stream the radio and type this. This is wrong, something needs to be done. No one else can even come to our area."
"Charlotte of Downingtown, PA","Jan. 3, 2015",1,They don't give you the upgrade charge right away. Impossible to get your bill straightened out.

"Ch of Houston, TX","Jan. 3, 2015",1,"I signed up for Internet service only through Comcast a little over three weeks ago for my new apartment. I only moved in a week ago and found that the self install service Comcast offered me as an option for my new home was not possible because there was no connection in my apartment (why they gave it to me as an option knowing this apartment never had Comcast is beyond me). So I called to set up a service appointment for full installation... the customer service representative gave me an all day appointment that kept extending as the day progressed (8 am to 5 pm, then to 8 pm, then to 10 pm!?). Finally I call back to be told that the technician came but it was an outside service (WTF!?) and everything is working now. I tell the CSR, repeatedly, I HAVE NO INTERNET CONNECTIONS period in my apartment; an ""outside"" job does nothing for me if it doesn't make its way inside... which it didn't, because no one showed up anyway.So I make another appointment. I literally spent 30 minutes on the phone to schedule it. Today, the day of the appointment arrives. Take a half-day off work and wait. I decide to call to confirm and lo and behold...NO APPOINTMENT. The girl I'm talking to proceeds to lie to me about my Tuesday appointment...saying that someone did come (a fact that was refuted by the last person I talked to) and that I have no appointment on file...I asked her if I could speak to a manager to try to get this resolved because each time I talk to one of the CSRs nothing happens, she says ""oh yes, sure, of course."" And then hangs up on me. I wasn't even going to complain about her... I called back to actually put in a complaint and am told there's no record of who I talked to less than 3 minutes earlier.I briefly worked a call center job while in grad school abroad, I know for a fact it sucks been people call in angry, so I try to be reasonable when I do call in. But seriously, I have never in my life been so frustrated dealing with CSRs in my life. I give up. I'd rather pay more elsewhere. The only thing that's good about this is that I was able to cancel my service (in store) and return my unused equipment free of charge because I am still in the 30-day money back guarantee period."
"Gwen of Glen Campbell, PA","Jan. 3, 2015",1,"Comcast has been the only cable provider for this particular geographic area since I moved here in 1999. We had a business and bought business class high speed Internet just because of the stable IP, the speed was really bad.. We consistently had problems and the problem was never in our house. IT was always their lines. Now (2015) I need high speed internet. For years we have been using speedtest.net to calculate our speed since Comcast would NEVER tell us what speed we were buying. No wonder. We have always had a ping of about 50 ms, download speed of 8.48 mbps and upload of 0.78 mbps. Today I spoke with a technician since I am being timed out by the VA, Netflx, Xfinfity downloads, etc. He said it can't be fixed because the lines need to be replaced and Comcast has no interest in doing that. Interestingly, Verizon has customers in the east part of town and they have FIOS. I understand Comcast and Verizon decided to split this area and I am on the wrong side of the division. The tech today actually reduced my monthly fees because the speeds are so bad...he says they don't even offer these speeds anymore. I asked to be upgraded and that wasn't possible because of the lines. Just what should I do now? Dish and Hughs don't work well here either due to the amount of snow we get. I feel like I am not an American citizen anymore. I bet there are places in Africa doing better than this speed."
"Juel of Washington, MI","Jan. 1, 2015",1,"This problem began in October 2014. Comcast ""lost"" my sister's email. When we called about it they said they don't recognize her even though she pays the bill with auto pay. Techs have come out and put in a new modem; said Comcast gave us an outdated modem when we signed up almost a year ago. Our internet is very slow (18) even though she pays for high speed which is supposed to be 105. Now Comcast has turned off the service to her house because of non payment. Comcast took her off of auto pay without any consent and then turned off the service for non payment. We have been trying for four days to get a tech out here. They were supposed to be here between 8:00 and 10:00 am today to re-connect the internet and they have not shown up. It is now 3:15 pm. Another tech was supposed to be here between 2:00 and 4:00 pm. She is on the phone with Comcast right now and they are saying there was never an appointment made. What I want to know is, what do we have to say to Comcast in order to get what is being paid for?"

Their solution to the problem was to say that we had to take the box to the Comcast store. The only way they would send a technician was if we paid for the visit and even then they said he would not bring a box, we would still have to get a new one ourselves. We are exploring our other options for Internet connection."

I expected the first bill to be off due to prorated charges BUT 254 for my first bill is INSANE!!! That's more than 2 months worth of services. There is no reason why I should be charged for 2 months. Not to mention the internet services sucks! I could never log on without my internet going out for 10 minutes at a time. The cable was bad too. People think only satellite freezes up and goes out. NO! MY cable would go out and freeze up for no reason at all...no explanation, no bad weather, nothing. They sent a tech out and he couldn't figure out the problem with my internet so that was never fixed. I never do reviews but I'm just so unsatisfied with this product, it's UNREAL."

We can't call our local Comcast location because we get connected with someone all over the world. We can talk to someone all over the world but not in our own city!! Ridiculous. If I try to call, I get an automated message that we can now download an app for Comcast to check service in our area. Well, if we don't have internet service, we can't use the app!!!! How stupid can they be?? I go on a live chat because if I talk to someone, they don't speak English and I can't understand them. EVERY time, I get the same song & dance - try this, or try that. Nothing works. Then they tell me they will send a technician - it will be about 3-4 days before he can come!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME????? Unacceptable. EVERY time, they need to send a signal to the TVs and after about 3-4 hours, it seems to clear up. I try telling them to just send a signal but they ask me 25 questions before they finally try that. I've asked for credits on our account and have never received them. Does anyone have a suggestion for a better cable service? I am done with Comcast.

"Omar of Newtown Square, PA","Dec. 25, 2014",1,"My mother's Comcast/Infinity wifi constantly goes out, and often runs slow. They are definitely deserving of one star. I have Time Warner in New York City, which has a bad rep, but they are far better than Comcast, both in terms of internet service and customer service. Many of the Comcast customer service agents at Comcast just don't feel like helping, and there's no continuity while you're speaking to different people. You're giving them the same information over and over, explaining the problem over and over, which is frustrating. This is what monopoly creates."

I feel completely cheated, swindled and held hostage by Comcast who hold a very unfortunate monopoly on TV and internet services in my area or I would have ditched them ages ago.

Today I explained to them that they actually owe me money. Their response was ""Will you be making a partial or full payment today?"" Really???? I will be finding a new internet provider. They are idiots. I have filed a complaint with the state attorney general. Maybe they will take notice...after all, what they have done to me is definitely not legal. Jerks."

They illegally charge for people's rights to privacy by asking for money when you refuse your Social security number. They lie and say this is for equipment to insure payments but they change the deposit fee to an actual fee on the bill then charge late fees illegally on falsified deposit money requests not received. You can't charge late fees on money that is a deposit, they do so by pretending the deposit is a charge of service by no longer announcing the deposit as such, thus allowing them to claim to not know why you owe the fee and try and get away with such charges. The billing becomes extortion and when you report the fraudulent billing to the FCC they tag on more mystery fees like suddenly they make modem fees appear even though their web site admits you have your own modem and no equipment of theirs. The Billing blames service and service dept. blames billing as a run around ensues. They try every trick imaginable to extort money and make customers have to spend time trying to fix what they refuse to fix. Privacy violations, strong arm tactics, interference of data transmission is some of their tools to get you to drop your FCC charges and consumer complaints (they removed half of my message to the FCC the complaint section was almost all erased). They even try copyright infringement tactics to scare and try and extort more money from their customers. These magically turn up after you file your report to the FCC, but they mess up because they date the incidents on days you can prove not to even be in town with modem or electricity turned on. It's almost as if someone within the organization is sabotaging the company, embezzling money, or attacking the customers, but then I see these tactics have existed for a long time, so I think perhaps this is their everyday known practice since they are too big to prevent from doing whatever they want.Updated on 12/28/2014:I've finally been able to be passed further down the line in this mess Comcast has created. I got one great rep to help remove some of the fraudulent charges, however older ones were still listed on their online bill. I was given a number to call for my dispute with the deposit, but the number said they temp shut my service till I paid the $100 to have it turned back on. (No mention if this was a deposit and since I paid all my bills on time what was owed this = extortion and breech of contract). In fact the number leads to a loops for payment through credit card and even though it says hold for a live rep the same message plays over and over trying to get credit card and payment info.I had a second number to try and resolve this. I had reached what claimed to be an executive support through writing one of the upper customer service managers and they called me a few times giving me a number that wasn't listed as Comcast and that number was just an answering machine each time I called and when leaving a message they never called back. Within this time I received a weird bank phishing email in my Comcast mail acct which nobody has my add for and it had no TO: info filled out, which is necessary in sending a message, so I checked the detail info on sender etc. and it was coming from a Comcast internal email.I plan on handing this info to the Executive support if I ever actually get a hold of them, to trace the ISP number and info along with their internal codes to see if this is an attempt to steal money from people's bank accounts as the work of their own employees or third parties they contract and give our info to. I also have specific details on my last check and letter stating they cannot cash my last check unless they admit I am paid in full and fix their fraudulent charges, therefore if they cash the last check after trying to extort $100 from me and shutting me off then they are literally stealing from my bank account and I will have the clear evidence whether they help decipher the weird bank phishing scam mail or not."
"Jaime of Boston, MA","Dec. 19, 2014",1,"On numerous occasions my wifi has been disabled causing me to contact the company, etc. It would not be a huge deal except that I pay numerous amounts in fees and charges for the service that never actually works. I know other people have issues with WIFI and I'm surprised Comcast has not had to make amends to their overcharges and unfair practices."
"victor of Kent, WA","Dec. 18, 2014",1,"I talk to cust. rep. last month about slow internet. They can't figure it out over the phone, offer to send someone over but never mention there's a charge... The guy shows up, takes him 3 min to fix the problem. Next month I see $70 charge on my bill. I go online, chat with an agent. He offers $70 credit.. I subtracted $70 from my bill. Next month I see the same $70 (past due). I call them, they say there is no record of anyone offering me $70... I'm pissed.. First they did not tell me there's going to be a charge, then someone lied to me about crediting my acct.. in the end they gave me $20."
"Robert of Milton, GA","Dec. 18, 2014",1,"No doubt the WORST TV/INTERNET/PHONE service EVER. Do not subscribe with them. They charge more than they tell you, don't show up for appointments, customer service hangs up on you. When I first signed on with them, I had 2 land lines to work from home. For 5 months my fax line would not work: 3 service calls, new fax machine and still nothing. When we finally found out Comcast didn't port the number from AT&T. They offered nothing,and was charged $350 install fee! They have zero customer service and don't care about customers. Even service men tell us it's awful. DO NOT USE Comcast. You'll be sorry. I promise you."
"Mitchell of Downers Grove, IL","Dec. 17, 2014",1,"In June, I signed up for the $29.99/month for the Internet Plus plan. When I received my first bill, I noticed being charged $39.99 for the service. I have contacted Comcast countless times since then, as I am still being overcharged. Despite calls, chat sessions, promises to receive callbacks, nothing has been resolved. I have even provided a screenshot of the Internet Plus promotion on Comcast.com for $29.99/month taken the day I signed up, but they refuse to honor it as it isn't a current promotion, even though it was when I signed up! The only attempts at correcting this issue were giving me faster internet and additional channels for a month each. Both of these resulted in even more additional charges to my account. Also, as part of my promotion, I was supposed to receive a $50 Visa prepaid card after 90 days of service. Six months have gone by, and I still have not received it. Whenever I inquire about this with Comcast, I am given the same response: ""Please allow up to sixteen weeks from your installation for your Visa prepaid card to mail. The additional four weeks after the 90-day period is to account for processing."" The two images are screenshots of the promotion for $29.99/month and my bill, reflecting the incorrect charge. To clarify my bill, it should state $69.95 - $39.96 $29.99/month promotion) + $8.00 = $37.99."
"Quoc of Hoffman Estates, IL","Dec. 17, 2014",1,"I was told by a customer representative, over the phone, that I would be paying for 25Mbps as part of their special promotion. They also told me that the promotion would end in 12 months with a 30 day money back guarantee. With good faith in the company, I continued to pay for 6 months under the impression I was getting just that. For awhile I thought slow speeds were a result of too many people in my apartment being on at once. However, after doing a few checks, I began to get suspicious and it turns out my internet had been changed to 3Mbps for months now. It seems that if it's not in writing, they can say anything to get you to fork your money over. I will be canceling their service after this billing period. What an awful sales tactic."
"steve of Alpharetta, GA","Dec. 16, 2014",1,"My son, who also has a Comcast internet account, recently moved back into our home. As it didn't make sense for both of us to pay for Comcast service at the same address, he called Comcast to have our account closed and the email addresses moved to his account. At this point I got on the phone with Comcast as well as I wanted to make sure there would not be any issues (we have used Comcast for over 10 years and all of our email is tied to the Comcast accounts). They assured me there would not be any problems and no disruption of service. Well... that was true for about two weeks and then without any notice our Comcast accounts were closed.I have since made 5 calls to Comcast customer support, two of those resulting in being disconnected during the calls, have had two different ""tickets"" opened to fix the problem, and have been told multiple times that it will be fixed within 24 hours. I HAVE BEEN WITHOUT EMAIL SERVICE FOR 6 DAYS AND IT STILL HASN'T BEEN FIXED. My email address is apparently no longer working and will not receive emails, and I have my bank accounts, other financial accounts, etc. all sending notifications, etc. to my email address... which Comcast can't seem to get set up again. This could turn into a major problem. For example, all of my credit card statements are sent electronically to my email account... only now I'm not getting them.This is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had in trying to work with a company. One word for anyone considering the Comcast service... RUN! Run as far away as you can as they apparently have no idea how to treat a customer of 10+ years. I will call again today for the 6th time as it still isn't working, but at this point I am open to suggestions as to what it might take to get my email accounts active again. Suggestions???"
"Derrill of Antioch, CA","Dec. 14, 2014",1,I was behind on my monthly payments and called in to go over my bill. I spoke with a nice car from the Philippines who told me Comcast had been overcharging me by $45 to $47 each month since March. She put thru a credit which she said would be between $250 and $300 that would appear by Friday. She also made an appointment for a tech to come look at my Internet whose performance had been terrible for months. She said she'd note the account to show the credit will be applied to my back payment so. That my service would not be turned off. I came home the following night to find my service disconnected - I called d's to see what happened & was told they had no record of a request for a credit on my account & they would not turn my service back on unless I paid my bill first. I late ranked them on a subsequent call to review the 1st call I made & reap for themselves what I was promised - the rep said she'd ask a manager to do this but when the tech came out no credit was on my account & no manager had contacted me saying they had listened to my 1st call. The tech said he couldn't do any work unless I paid my bill first. By this time I was so disgusted with having to deal with this thieving lying company that I told the tech to take everything Comcast out of my house. They have lost a customer that had been with them for over 20 years. This company no longer deserves my business.
"Cath of San Jose, CA","Dec. 13, 2014",1,"I've been paying my bills online for years, using the same account numbers. I started using the Comcast online pmt system since Dec. 2013. It worked, then suddenly one month, it didn't go through. I called to complain and they removed the $25.00 fee. Well, it happened again in Dec of 2014, and I called telling them I've been using the same account numbers and it didn't go through. So I get the fee charge again. I explained that the account numbers are the same and they pop up automatically when I go to type them in, so how could I put in a wrong number? My bank didn't make a mistake, and I didn't make a mistake. It is THEIR system that made the mistake. They refused to take the charge off and I switched to paper billing. DO NOT USE THE ONLINE PAYMENT SYSTEM! IT IS FRAUDULENT!"
"Joe of Pequea, PA","Dec. 11, 2014",1,"I created an account here just to write this complaint up hopefully warning people to stay away from Comcast Internet Provider. I could write up a thousand adjectives about their service and only about two would be positive. My current internet is atrocious, first of all, it is the slowest internet I've seen in my entire life, it must be comparable to dial up connection. Next, the biggest problem is that the internet resets itself after every five minutes or so, so every single one of my devices loses all of their internet and that becomes unbearable when working on something (it will probably be lost when writing this complaint, leaving me to start over). It will kick me off of Xbox Live completely after every 5 minutes, my Kindle is always in a reconnecting state because by the time it finally connects again, it's lost right away. I've seriously never saw a provider this bad, and I personally think I could stick an antenna onto my microwave and it would be more efficient. Why people buy from Comcast remains a mystery."
"Carlos of Jacksonville, FL","Dec. 10, 2014",1,"Hidden Fees are everywhere. They are trained not to answer your questions regarding fees/credits/etc, it's ridiculous. I promise you will be sorry working with xfinity and comcast. Avoid them at all costs."
"Karin of Taylorsville, UT","Dec. 10, 2014",1,"Our local DSL service could not provide the Internet speeds we needed to conduct our business from home so we reluctantly decided to switch to Comcast Internet service with ""Blast"", approx. 50+mbps speed when it's working (the company reviews are terrible and now we know why first-hand). When it's working, both the upload and download speeds are great, but the reliability is just plain terrible. We have to reboot the wireless router at least once a week and have had the service go down completely for hours at a time on several occasions in the past 6 months. When you call ""customer service"" you can't reach anyone and often the company IVR doesn't work at all and hangs up on you. In the 11 years we had DSL prior to switching to Comcast Internet, we had 4 outages and had to reset the wireless modem maybe once every several months. Despite living in a major suburb of Salt Lake City, we only have 2 Internet provider options available to us (based on our address). We need far more competition to encourage and ensure reliable and affordable Internet service."
"Teresa J of Santa Maria, CA","Dec. 9, 2014",1,I was told that my $49 a month contract is over. I was shocked to see my bill go up to $62 for plain internet service. I chatted with the staff online and gave me a $59 deal for cable TV. I do not have a TV nor do I want to use online viewing. I just wanted plain internet DSL service and for a $62+ service? Time to look for another service. I realized that I was not the only disgruntled customer. I feel for all the customers who felt ripped off.
"Francisco of Stuart, FL","Dec. 8, 2014",1,"It's funny that I just read another review that describes my situation. I recently upgraded my services and I got a neat new web gateway that worked wonderfully the first week. Then the WiFi started loosing range. I traded it in for another one and when I first connected it, it worked great. Then I started getting messages that I couldn't open the web page, not even the Comcast home page. I called for a technician and he came Friday morning at 8:00 AM. It was like if his coming over was magic. The internet worked like a rocket. Two hours later it was back to waiting, and more waiting. I have been with Comcast for almost 10 years, and until I upgraded my service I had great service. Now it sucks, and I don't know if I can do anything about it."
"Chris of Pleasanton, CA","Dec. 7, 2014",1,"We signed a new contract to lower our monthly payment, and when the contract kicked in, we lost all our services. Comcast has yet to fix it and when we set up a service appointment for Dec 7th at 8am, our confirmation came back for 2pm. We were told we never had an 8am appointment. No one was able to help us and actually got offended that we were upset. We talked to 5 different people and when transferred, not one person explained the situation to the person we were being transferred to."
"Dan of San Leandro, CA","Dec. 7, 2014",1,"I have been troubled by the speed Comcast providing for the whole duration of my 1 year contract. Contracted up to 50 mbps. However, the speed was initially good, but will quickly get down to single digit. I called Comcast multiple times per month. Every time, they made me go through the same same ritual: ""recycle"" the router, which also takes out my phone. Then I called in again, then they did one same thing - ""re-provision"" my internet service. That is their name for the one click of button they did at their end. The re-provisioning always brought the speed back up to 50+. In one minute, while I was still on the phone with Comcast tech support, the speed went way up. This pattern shows Comcast knew what the problem is and know how to fix it. But they just pretend not so by having me going through all the regular steps. In addition, they don't fix the real problem. The re-provisioning is just a temporary fix. They might just grab the bandwidth from another consumer and provided to me. And when other calls, they will grab my bandwidth away. My speed will drop back to single digit, or even 0.5 mbps after a day or two. Sometimes after as quickly as half an hour.I read so many complaint about Comcast on this site. I noticed that the complaints are across geographic location in the US. Comcast is cheating all over the country. Comcast service is expensive. I spent over $60 per month for the service. There should be a CLASS ACTION lawsuit against Comcast for breaching their contract with subscribers. The legal action is warranted because of the magnitude of the offense!"
"Teresa of Lansing, MI","Dec. 5, 2014",1,"I returned from a trip this Spring 2014 to find my Comcast bill had many fees and when I left I made sure I paid ahead 6 months. December I paid 6 mos. ahead to come back to a horror in my Comcast bill. So doing research into why and how I could be behind I found that in September 28 or 29th of 2013 I made a payment of $130.22 that was never credited to my bill - which snowballed into me being behind. So that meant my December 6 mo. payment wasn't right either according to Comcast. Since then I called several times with no success. I just kept getting more fees late charges even though they told me my bill was on hold until this was resolved. So Comcast kept shutting me off while they were supposed to be finding out where my money went. I paid their fees just to keep my service on and I'd get more fees. I paid over a years worth of service fees that I could of paid and had over a years worth of service in just a couple months. I'd pay the bill and they would shut off my service. I'd call, they'd shut it back off. They shut it off 3 times in one day. I'd call and the person I talk to would say, ""I see no reason for your service to be off."" They were doing anything and everything to get me to forget it all! I contacted the executives in PA, Daniel, he completely blew me off after he asked all my info and wasted my time for a half hour on the phone, told me he couldn't do anything to help me because someone else had it!!! He was like, ""I can restore your service."" I was like, ""I have service, well when I got off the phone I didn't have service anymore even with a paid bill."" So the person he said I had to call was Andrea **. I have talked to her several times. Nothing done. When this started they had asked me to send proof to Comcast so to the office it went in hand and had them fax it right from Comcast on Clippert Street Lansing MI. Well they closed it, they claim they never got it. So I sent it to Andrea the bank statements, nope not good enough. So I went back to the bank, got it on letter head and sent it again along with every credit card I had been at the same bank 20 yrs. The bank said for Comcast to call them, they refused. Because I have all the proof they stole my money and they owe me all the fees they charged me along with compensation for shutting me off several times. They also took it upon themselves to remove me from internet essentials and put me on a more expensive plan and charge me 70.00. I called internet essentials, they put it back, that was a few days after I found out what they had done. So to this day I've got nothing but a big blow off. They stole my money and charged me all this other money and I will never give up. They also caused my son to not be in school since he's in k12 online."
"Heather of York, PA","Dec. 1, 2014",2,"I have called numerous times for them to continually ask me to start unplugging and re-plugging cords. They send signals to modem with no avail. I tried to speak with someone else higher up and the phone person gets angry and starts talking in circles, never do I get another service person just disrespect. I live in the country but will get dial up I guess. In 2014, I should be able to have internet."
"Ahmed of Patterson, CA","Nov. 30, 2014",1,"This has been an on-going issue w/Comcast. Our services in the area of Patterson, CA has been unstable. Regardless as to if you're signed up for 100mbps+ download speed you will get anywhere between 2-20mbps of the actually download speeds provided. There are calls made not just by me, but my neighbors and just about everyone I speak with in Patterson about this issue and nothing is being done to resolve it. They may resolve it one day, but it reoccurs 4-5 times per month and it's very frustrating for paying customers as they're not getting the speeds they should be getting. And practically every night after 8pm until 6-7am, the speeds will always drop to around 2-5mbps. They will send a tech in the morning to take a look at this and of course, every time the tech comes, the issue is gone (makes you wonder). To make matters worse, they've blocked all competition in the area for other ISP providers to compete against their monopoly of the area so you can't just switch service. There's only one service here that offers over 15mbps service and that's unfortunately Comcast. The top rated worst cable provider in based on both BBB and Consumer Affairs and nothing is being done about this monopoly. Them buying Time-Warner will only make matters that much worse for other people across the United States."
"D of Witlon, NH","Nov. 29, 2014",1,I purchased Comcast's performance internet service. They advertise 25 Mbps.

The tech left, said they'd be back the next day. They never showed up. My wife called to complain to the company but nobody showed up. I called comcast and told them to get out their equipment out of my house. They returned and remove the equipment from my home. I was sent a bill for cable. I called on it, I have a confirmation number, told the bill would be removed. Comcast has taken my phone line and will not give back to. Wow! Now I have to go elsewhere to fax paperwork. I have since received another bill from comcast with late charges. This whole ordeal has taken time for me which I plan to bill comcast for my time also. We have missed doctor appointments because we have no phone line at this point. Phone calls will bring me no justice."
"Ed of Atlanta, GA","Nov. 23, 2014",1,Everyday it seems like they have a connection problem. The customer service experience was the worst consumer experience I have ever dealt with. DO NOT do business with Comcast. They do nothing to help you. Just a lot of lip service.
"H of Boston, MA","Nov. 22, 2014",1,"I received a call in November 2014 saying that I should upgrade my Modem. They told me to go on this site ** and depending on which item you pick allowed up to click to buy straight from Amazon.com. And that's exactly what I did and bought a used one. Unfortunately, that's what I did. 3 hours on the phone, 2.5 hours at the customer service office, I still cannot register my modem. A legit modem that I bought from a Amazon reseller online. Their advice? You should have bought a new and paid full price. Why did you buy used? Honey, you gave me the link and I bought the used one because it was 50% off and it was an option. Don't patronize me! I pay my bills on time, just let me register this online. This regionalization of buying modems and monopolizing a market is frustrating to consumers."
"Byron of Houston, TX","Nov. 21, 2014",1,"Wow, here I am another victim of Comcast. I paid to close my account twice, returning all comcast equipment and they still did not close my account.

"Blain of Ogden, UT","Nov. 21, 2014",1,"While trying to sign up for Comcast internet, had the first order completely canceled by a customer service employee, the second order inputted wrong with the wrong services, and then the third time I talked to customer service, they billed me the wrong price as an existing customer, not a new customer. So when no one could change my prices or services correctly, I was given the infamous customer retention/account management team, which are the worst people in the world. All of my phone calls are recorded and I have a two-hour phone conversation where someone hangs up on me after 2 hours, and also a 40-minute phone conversation of which 30 of it is me repeating over and over, ""Can I speak to your supervisor,"" and the female employee refusing to transfer me for 30 minutes. This is what happens in a world of deregulation and no competition. As soon as Google can get Fiber to my house, Comcast can have their modem back and I will go with a company that cares about its product and its customers."

It was never replaced, the people didn't come out and fix it or replace it. You charged me for the replacement. I called back and told them that it was never replaced. Got that so far? Ok, here's the problem: now that we've cancelled our ** service with you **, I took my router back to the Comcast store and they told me that we now have 2 pieces of equipment on our account. And they wonŠ—Èt take it back until we get the other router (THAT WAS NEVER GIVEN TO US) back to them. Listen, thereŠ—Ès only one way you can fix this: take that extra ** off our account."

"Shane of Deerfield Beach, FL","Nov. 18, 2014",1,I have never received such horrific customer experience ever. After being a customer for over 2 years I noticed my bill increasing little by little. My bill started out at $119.00 and then the second year $139.00 and now $179.00. I called to inquire why my bill had increased since my contract was over. After being on hold numerous times for more than 20 minutes each and hung up on I opted to close my account. I would not recommend this service.
"Jesse of Colo Springs, CO","Nov. 18, 2014",1,"Worst customer service ever. I have been dealing with an issue since March 2012 when I purchased a modem from Saveology.com to use at my residence for internet use. Months later noticed the bill was too high. Called Xfinity, in Oct of 2013 and was told that it was their mistake, they couldn't refund my money past 2 months but I was given a decent package for my trouble. Well last month again (Oct 2013), I noticed my bill was high and once again called about it, only to find that I was being charged a leasing fee for that same modem. I was told that it was taken care of, no future charges will be charged, and again, no total refund was offered. I was pissed and told my neighbor who works at Comcast and he gave me a card. I called the card tonight (11-17-2014), only to find that that lease charge is still on my account! Doug ** told me that it is being audited and there is nothing he can do without a receipt. He could not produce a record other than a order number that was originally in error. He said that he trusts that order number shows that I ordered a modem from Xfinity. I checked my records on gmail (Thank God for that storage) and found the receipt. I told people over at Xfinity over and over again, ""the customer is always right! Why are you doing this? You make me never want to use this company again!"" He responded with he cannot just give the modem away, even though paying $109 plus $8 a month puts this modem at around $300 that is giving it away! Advice if you are going to use this company don't use paperless billing, save your receipts and  don't expect anything from their customer service because they will tell you one thing and another will happen. Either they don't know, or they are lying. I hope that the regional manager for Xfinity Colorado sees this and has the guts to send a written letter of apology and give me a full refund."

"Kate of Centennial, CO","Nov. 16, 2014",1,"In August, I changed from my DVR service, the shiny new X1 platform. What a complete piece of crap. I have struggled with it for 3 months now. The equipment in 3 locations in my house was fouled up every other day, I kid you not. I have LESS functionality than I had with the DVR! I finally called them to move back to my old DVR equipment. No problem! But I either have to pay $70 for a service call, or drive clear across town (Denver area) to switch out the equipment. I work like most of us, and their service center is only open during my work hours, no weekend hours. So I would have to blow off 2 to 3 hours to accomplish this. I finally kept complaining, and they agreed to ship the new equipment at no cost. So, now is where the fun starts. They sent me 4 boxes. One is the central box, the other are satellite, like X1. The master box is the only one with pause or rewind capability during a show. You can only set recordings from the main box. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? No different from X1 except it's not based on an internet connection. And get this...the equipment doesn't work! I can either go to the service center, or they can once again ship new equipment, or I can wait for 5 days for a service call. And I can't watch any TV. I have a long fuse, I believe in solving disputes in a reasonable and respectful fashion. I am always courteous. But I'm at the end of my rope with Comcast. I'm a raving mad customer who would love to fire them, but I can't because they have the monopoly. Comcast is pure evil. My frustration has brought me to tears. The only reasonable thing I can say is their staff is pleasant. They just can't fix the problem or do anything to compensate you. I genuinely HATE THEM. If you have a choice, any pick is better than Comcast."
"Dale of Ossining, NY","Nov. 15, 2014",1,"I wouldn't even call this a review, more of an injustice. The scam these guys pull is unacceptable. Hidden increased charges, piss poor speeds, poor customer service. You're rated the worst company in America for a reason."
"Don of Atlanta, GA","Nov. 14, 2014",1,"Am a new customer, new account, less than a week & am finding almost daily that my PC and other devices are consistently not able to connect... how? And why? A Google search for ""xfinity internet redirects me to an activation page"" helped me learn that I was just screwed as did a visit the XFINITY on Facebook. Thinking about alternates? Drop these guys..."
"joe of Pompano Beach, FL","Nov. 12, 2014",1,"Everything was fine when I made a critical mistake and upgraded (in price only) to Comcast's new x1 system. Not only did it not work properly just about every night... the customer service experience was the worst consumer experience I have ever dealt with. DO NOT do business with Comcast. They literally treat you worse than an old piece of garbage. I spent enough time dealing with them so I cannot take more time to describe what has transpired. All I can say is YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. If you do not take my advice, you will reflect back on this and regret your decision. Comcast is the worst company EVER!!!"
"Donna of Sea Bright, NJ","Nov. 10, 2014",1,"I subscribed to triple play three months ago. I didn't realize at the time I was signing on for a two year contract as that was never discussed, so basically I'm stuck and I've been told that by one of their reps. I have been on the phone with them on a weekly basis because service is sporadic with regards to cable, internet & phone. I have to set aside at least 1 hour 45 minutes for each phone call before I get someone to ""help"". As I am typing this I am waiting for a tech to come to my house. The appt was from 9-1. I have also been on the phone for 45 minutes with Comcast. They are telling me tech has been to house and resolved issue (not the case). Their automated service says appt is for tomorrow from 9-11, which was discussed, but I explained I would not be home and it would have to be Monday so he gave me Monday 9-1 and gave me a confirmation number. Now at 12:29 they will see if they can get a tech out. They will call me back when they know. Another day wasted. If anyone wants triple play service go to Verizon. Run from Comcast."
"Michel of Boca Raton, FL","Nov. 10, 2014",1,"I got Comcast when I moved to my new apartment in Sept 2014. I switched from AT&T because my AT&T bill went too high and I wanted to have my internet-cable within the budget. I called Comcast and spoke to a customer rep who first promised a flat $39 rate and no charges for installation or technician services. Besides I was offered a 50GB internet as part of the deal. I was OK with the service although my internet was very unstable and slow but I believed it was my building that was slowing down the signal. It took me for surprise when I got my bill with charges for $40 for technician, moreover I realized that I never got the 50GB but instead 25GB. I called approximately to complain and they didn't do anything to fix my bill. They offered me to increase my internet from 25 to 50GB at not cost. Never happened. What they did is charged me $10.00 every month for a service I never got. Every month I have to call to ask to correct the bill. I will switch to any provider in a short time frame."
"Adam of Orem, UT","Nov. 9, 2014",1,"I'm 31 years old. I was actually around for the advent of the Internet. I remember how slow a 56k dial-up phone modem was, and trust me, Comcast/Xfinity is slower!! On average, I get speeds of no more than 0.4mb/s and my ping is absolutely outrageously horrible!! Furthermore, the Internet cuts out constantly, forcing me out of my games and videos, and I can't stream ANYTHING on it, NOT EVEN YOUTUBE!! Comcast/Xfinity is absolutely the worse thing on the market that a person can buy and what's worse? They're the only Internet provider in my area. There's literally NOBODY else I can go to. If I still had the modem, hookup, and drivers for it, I'd install a 56k modem in a heartbeat and finally enjoy a fast internet service!! This is pure, undiluted, crap!! AVOID COMCAST/XFINITY AT-ALL-COSTS IF YOU CAN!!"
"Paul of Chicago, IL","Nov. 9, 2014",1,"Some friends of mine who are and older couple just moved and decided to order new Comcast service. They asked me to be there the day of the Comcast install because I work in the computer/internet business myself and they wanted me to make sure the computers were connected and working properly on the internet and that their TV service was working properly. They figured a ""second set of eyes"" would also be helpful to assure that the Comcast technician did things correctly, because I told them a few horror stories about awful Comcast installs I had witnessed in the recent past.The technician was scheduled to arrive between 1 and 3 PM. I arrived around 1:30 PM that day (Nov 7th, 2014). We waited and waited...no Comcast guy by 3PM. We called, they said dispatch said he would be about 30 minutes late...3:30 then 4:00 then 4:30 PM..still no show. We called again, took the customer service guy 20 minutes to try and reach dispatch and the technician. Finally he told us that they could reach the original technician scheduled on the job, but that they transferred it to another technician who was on his way and he would be there before 7:00 PM (on a Friday evening). We said okay,..and...and..wait, wait....wait...wait...NO SHOW. Comcast sucks. Period."
"Victoria of San Jose, CA","Nov. 8, 2014",1,"I'm going to be accurate and fair. The individual I initially called to send technical support over was nice, patient and helpful; unfortunately, the support itself was not. He comes into our door with his first words being ""I parked in the 20 min spot, so this better be quick. I don't want a ticket."" No name introduction? Kay. After taking a look at our modem, he concluded that there was nothing he could do and that wifi was a luxury, so we'll just have to deal with it. Pardon me, what? I'm usually very understanding, but I just can't comprehend why Comcast would hire employees that represent their company in that manner. I'm disappointed, and will keep this encounter in mind going forward. What a waste of bill payments."
"Jordan of Lakewood, CO","Nov. 7, 2014",2,"Just upgraded both my boxes to the Xfinity X1 system two days ago, and within those two days we have already ran into two of THE biggest problems not only with cable, but TV in general I have ever encountered. The first problem, two days after upgrading my boxes, they had a serious malfunction and system problem where the DVR was literally out of commission. All they could say or respond with (via message in front of you on your screen) was press restart and the problem you've encountered MAY be fixed. Well funny thing, that took over a half hour for that to kick in and fix the problem whether it was actually a resetting of the system or not, it was ridiculous and long. Now two days later, ON Demand says ""Sorry we are experiencing difficulties and cannot process your request""... Sounds like an automated response to me, right? I'm usually not the type to even leave a review, let alone bash something but holy crap these last four days have been dismal for my new X1 set up and xfinity themselves!!! I love you guys and will never switch to Dish, or DirecTV but please figure this out and appease your loyal customers with something they truly admire and acknowledge."
"Larry of Peachtree City, GA","Nov. 7, 2014",1,"April of 2014, Comcast picked up their modem and gave me a receipt showing that. Each month there is a charge for modem rental. Each month I called to get it taken off. Sometimes they would credit it back and try to take it off the bill. Alas, this has been going on every month since. Finally got to talk to a manager and he told me that we will be credited back when they find the modem they picked up. If they don't locate it then we get charged for the whole modem. I asked him if he understood what he just said to mean. ""How is that fair?"" I asked and he said there is nothing that can be done and I would just have to wait. To make matters worse, they billed us a $70 Trouble Charge. Who can I get to help me make a corporation listen to reason and do what's right?"
"idalys of Boca Raton, FL","Nov. 4, 2014",1,"I have had Comcast for only 1 month and in these 4 weeks I have made 3 trips to the service center, multiple visits by technicians and still no results. This is by far the worst ISP provider I have ever dealt with. Both my husband and I work from home and we need certain speeds and we are only getting 2x download speeds... It's ridiculous!! They say they fixed the problem but they haven't. You call their customer service number and all they do is transfer you around and you have to tell your story over every time.... Well, we only had them 4 weeks and today I am switching to AT&T. Someone should really do an investigation on this company and their processes and procedures... THEY NEED A CLUE ON HOW TO TREAT A CUSTOMER AND MANAGE THEIR BUSINESS...."
"Stephanie of Sacramento, CA","Nov. 1, 2014",1,"I have had to deal with Comcast so many times since 2009 and I've regretted it every single time. If it wasn't bad enough they're pretty much an anti-trust monopoly -- which means I have few alternatives to them -- the service they do provide manages to be wretched, sub-par and abysmal. The service claims to offer up to 75 mbps of broadband speed, yet I rarely ever hit that. My experience with them has been one filled with dropped connections, throttled speeds, and mediocre customer service.Every time I try to talk to their customer service reps, my problems rarely get addressed. All I get is palliative reassurances that 'everything is fine' when they test my internet connections (which coincidentally, occurs during the few moments when my connection is stable) and then something about testing my router, only to be told the problem is on my end and not their part. Then after all of that is over, my internet will go back to sucking again.Also, for some reason, despite how Comcast rakes in billions of dollars every single fiscal year, they can't seem to make their online, automatic payment system work. As a result, my card doesn't get charged on time and on several different occasions, I've had to pay an exorbitantly large late fee as a punishment for the fact that their servers can't process online payments like other companies do. Long story short: Comcast gets a -1000 out of ten from me. I long for the day when actual competition comes along and either Verizon or Google Fiber comes to this area and I will never have to put up with this scrupulous, amoral company with no ethics or concern for others, ever again."
"Margaret of Muncie, IN","Nov. 1, 2014",1,"Comcast/xfinity is a nightmare. If anyone can avoid them avoid them like a plague. They are deceptive, lying, manipulative, horrible slap-you-in-the-face business practices. They actually tell reps to lie, to be deceptive. Otherwise they can lose their jobs. Don't work for them. They will only steal the real true person you are and want to be. Only liars work for them. If you are a son or daughter of the great 'decepter' then you belong there.From day 1 they've overcharged me on things. After a year it finally got right then the 1 year promotion is over they charge me double. I upgrade, they do nothing in their promotion right. They start overcharging me again."
"R. A. of Port Charlotte, FL","Oct. 31, 2014",1,"I was living at an apartment in Ft Myers FL. It was infested with bed bugs so I went to court and broke my lease. I had Comcast hook up cable, alarm, internet triple play but with security instead of phone. I moved in February and moved out end of April and I didn't pay last months cable bill which ran about 140$ after tax. I moved in with my father in-law and he got sick with a brain tumor. I returned all the equipment about a month after moving out. My father in-law died and me and my fiance moved to Port Charlotte FL about 30 mins away. I ordered with Comcast to install the same thing I had at Ft Myers address. In the meantime, I found out that Comcast was billing me 640$ for the account in Ft Myers. They come and install the new equipment at the new address and everything is great and I pay until my bill as soon as I get it and things have been good. So I go check the mail on October 31st 2014 and there is a bill in there from Comcast for 1796.00$ so I call and was on the phone with 5 different people explaining what happened. And they all say they charged me a cancellation fee of 1100$ and say to hold on, they need to transfer me or get their supervisor and then I get disconnected!!!! Can someone help me out please! This is crazy and I've been dealing with this since I moved in this address trying to come to an agreement. I figure I owe them about 200$ for the last month bill I didn't pay plus a little late fee. That's it, thanks for listening."
"maribel of Orlando , FL","Oct. 31, 2014",1,"From day 1 they installed, it has never work RIGHT. I have call your damn customers service and no one seems to know what the hell is wrong .... mMy calls get put on hold for hours and then dropped - no call back.

"Roger of Ada, MI","Oct. 31, 2014",1,"When Comcast added Xfinity WiFi hotspot, my home network stopped working. I cannot get my gateway to reset so that the home network works. Now all I have is much slower internet connection and not the speed I am paying for."
"Don of Houston Texas, TX","Oct. 30, 2014",1,"Comcast provides my business internet and tv through Xfinity. On the website they gave me to log in, under my account it shows my services and one of their services is online streaming and online tv. I have had this for 9 months and it worked fine. According to person on phone they migrated away and no longer provide this service to business customers. However, no reduction fee. When you sign it says the service is provided. When you call unless you press they say it was never part of service for business, and want to ignore the fact their online says it is. FTC should look into this false advertising by a company that nearly has a monopoly."
"Glenn of West Hartford, CT","Oct. 26, 2014",1,"Be careful when responding to direct mail or internet offers to join Comcast Xfinity. I responded to a piece of direct mail offering a 200 dollar visa card and all sorts of perks, including free HBO for two years, etc. Here I am four months into being a customer, no gift card and had to argue to get the HBO and they would only put me on a 6 month offer. They cannot locate my introductory offer stipulations, even though I have the offer right in front of me. Numerous calls to their customer service department proved futile with inexperienced reps ringing their hands, not knowing what to say or how to fix the problem. One thing is for sure, if they don't know what they're offering and seem to be baiting and switching once you join, GET EVERYTHING in writing before you agree to switch from your current cable/internet company.. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!"
"Ashwin of Cambridge, MA","Oct. 23, 2014",1,Got a new Comcast internet connection. The internet cuts in and out and does not work all the time. I spoke to Comcast 4 times over the last week and still I get the run around. Comcast is the worst cable internet service and if I have a choice I would never use it.
"Shirley of Montgomery, TX","Oct. 23, 2014",1,"Called for Internet and phone service and was told they would be out in 2 days. Long story short, I have taken off work 5 times and the fools still haven't gotten me service. Don't call 1-800-Comcast unless you speak a foreign language!"
"John of Tucson, AZ","Oct. 22, 2014",1,"He made a call and told me that the repair would be done between September 25th and October 9th. But they never showed, never called, and I never heard from Comcast until October 9th when I received an email informing me that the new repair date was October 16th. But they never showed for that one either and I never heard from them. To make a long story not so long, they also missed the next two appointments, the latest was yesterday October 21st. Never showed, never contacted me. Today I got an email from them stating that the repair was now rescheduled to be completed by November 13th. Today is October 22nd and this has been going on since early September and nothing's been done. And didn't think of it but no one ever gave me an order number either."
"Kevin of Portland, OR","Oct. 18, 2014",1,"I order a 25 internet speed and I did a speed test and it only gives me 6.28. Don't buy Comcast, it's crap and it puts money in your bills."
"Reddy of Alpharetta, GA","Oct. 17, 2014",1,"They just don't care, even though they are all over the news for bad customer service - this company does not care. I am a new customer and I am already thinking of moving to a different service provider. When I set up my service they promised one thing. When I get the email confirmation itŠ—Ès different and when the technician is here to install itŠ—Ès a whole different story. I had to call them 6 times to reach the correct department. They just keep transferring me all over the place and the customer service reps are so rude. The next time I call them is to cancel my service and it is pretty soon."
"Bob of Elgin, IL","Oct. 17, 2014",1,"My experience with Comcast is that they subsidize new customer promotional pricing at the expense of long-standing loyal customers by raising their rates. Then they make it nearly impossible to speak to someone with any common sense, or even cares whether you continue as a customer or not. They just don't care!"
"YVONNE of Stafford, VA","Oct. 14, 2014",1,"I canceled my Comcast service back in July 2014. I was told that I was due a refund and should expect to receive within four to six weeks. Well here it is, mid October and I am still awaiting my refund. I called Comcast customer service (which is out sourced by the way). The agent had no clue whatsoever, she kept putting me on hold. After repeatedly putting me on hold for 10 minute intervals she finally transferred me to the WRONG department. After an hour and a fifteen minutes of dealing with a bunch of obviously poorly trained customer agents I finally got frustrated and hung up!! I am still awaiting my refund. I will NEVER, NEVER, EVER use COMCAST ever again!! They are by far the worst cable company I have ever dealt with, they are thieves and refuses to refund customers monies due after canceling service for prepaid service."
"CECILIA ANDREA of Washington, DC","Oct. 13, 2014",1,"I HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE WITH THIS COMPANY. Seriously they should stop serving people. They overcharged, they change your services, offer you a nice package for an affordable price, the surprise: it doubled up for x and y reason. Customer service is not polite, signal is bad, WI-FI is slow, the channel line-up sucks!!! After 4 months of being over-billed and had a TERRIBLE SERVICE I got to disconnected from COMCAST (I had to bring the router to their store, it was back in July). I aged in those four months believe me.On September I received a new bill from these **, they continue charging me with no reason. Because they bill you one month in advance so there is no way to own them money. When I got disconnected I had actually balance in my favor. But if Comcast could take your eyes, it would!! Called several times to solve it. It was supposed to be solved, but guess what I am in collection center now. REALLY? Now I can't get anyone to help me because they say I need to solve with them, that comcast has nothing to do with it. COMCAST is the worst BS!!!"
"Laura of Salinas, CA","Oct. 12, 2014",1,"I have a internet/cable bundle. I was receiving reception for approx. 60 channels for four months. All of a sudden, two days ago, they cut the reception by about 20 channels without any notice!

"Rmm of Alpharetta, GA","Oct. 10, 2014",1,"Comcast is literally the most pathetic excuse of an internet service known to man.

I was informed that if i was not happy with the service that i could cancel with no charge or change - THE FOURTH LIE. I changed to what i originally wanted, the 3 MBS and it works fine. I was however charged the full amount of the $55.00 for the first month as the service is suddenly.... prorated. The fifth lie. I will cancel and strongly warn everyone to avoid this corrupt corporation. "
"Alex of Venice, FL","Oct. 8, 2014",5,"I have had Comcast for over 5 years now, it would seem ever since I have retired. My wife and I moved from upper New york state and we received terrible internet service where we lived! Always shotty, you would have to cross your fingers and say a little prayer to Mary in hopes that it might work! When we moved down here the folks in our retirement community told us about bundling our package for phone, television, and internet so we did. Now I have no use for the darn phone because I have had my cell phone now for some time and it served me well, but for some reason Verizon just doesn't do too well where I'm at! I don't have any coverage! That's why we got the phone.... Well if I tell you that the service I was provided was anything less than amazing I would be just lying through my teeth!Now sure over the years we've had a couple problems especially after hurricane Charlie and a couple nasty storms causing outages and downed power lines, but it was all fixed shortly there after! One time I called up the customer service just as angry as a gang of honey bees, ready to just quit them, because we were out of all three services for 1 week! They immediately apologized and explained that there were some downed lines which there happened to be, I went and looked myself, and they gave me a 25% discount on my bill for that month! I didn't ask for it, they just offered it to me and it wasn't just a day after my call that, it was back on!I see all these angry responses to Comcast and I might not know everything in my 62 years of life! I've been in war, served in the U.S.M.C., rank of Staff Sergeant was the highest I made it to til my service was over! I will say this that for my area, they do well by me. Maybe the difference is the places we are at but they are stellar in my eye!"
"Marcia of Jacksonville, FL","Oct. 8, 2014",1,"In June 2014 I contacted Comcast regarding new service. The salesperson said I would get a $450 Visa gift card after 3 months of continuous service if we signed up for XFinity Triple Play. We said to go ahead, service was installed July 2014. After NOT receiving any confirmation nor paperwork regarding the gift card, I called Comcast to verify. After numerous run-arounds I was told that I would get the gift card by the end of Nov. 2014. After our 3 months of continuous service, I called again & got the run-around again. Nobody seemed to know anything about a $450 gift card! Now I am told by their sales dept. that I never completed the contract because they never finished it & that's why there's no record of the promotion on my acct. Now they are saying I can't get the gift card because of that! They dropped the ball & I lose out! This is the worst provider! I don't see how they can stay in business!"
"L. F. of San Francisco, CA","Oct. 7, 2014",1,"I have reported this problem to Comcast via email and with their customer service. Regardless of the fact that I have checked the little box that is supposed to ""keep me signed in"" to my internet account for 30 days at a time, I am still forced to sign on average 4 times per day just to get my email. Customer Service stated they would send a Tech out to my home. I made the appointment. When I received the confirmation email for the appointment, it made it very CLEAR that I would be billed for this service! I cancelled the appointment immediately. I cannot believe I pay for internet/email service that DOES NOT PERFORM to this company's specifications. Setting up these bogus tech appointments is just another way to reach into the customer's pocket! Funny that this problem started to happen at exactly the same time that I had called Comcast about their monthly bill notification email. Every month, I would receive an email that stated ""Your Bill is Ready"". This email would be sent to me 7-8 days after I had just paid my previous bill! WTF? Totally annoying! So I called Comcast and told them to STOP sending these email notifications. It was right at that time I found myself having to constantly login to get my email. BTW, I will NOT set up auto pay with this Crap Xfinity/Comcast Company because I don't trust them one iota, i.e., I DO NOT want them to have free reign with my bank account. I need to get set up with a new ISP ASAP!"
"Jessica of Chicago, IL","Oct. 2, 2014",1,"The only service I'm getting from Comcast is a high bill. My service is hardly ever working & customer service are very disrespectful & always blame it on my computer or a virus. I've taken my computer in; nothing wrong. I've talked to Norton security; they said my security system is working & I have no viruses & the only thing not working is internet explorer. They just want to send a tech so they can charge me extra money. A tech came out in the past & said they didn't give me the right cords & the internet modem was jumping, so he had to get new cords & a different modem out of his van. But they still charged me on my bill; even though they say if it's their service that's not working, you don't have to pay. I shouldn't even have to pay my bill since my service isn't working. At one time, I had internet & cable, but when I cut off the cable I received a higher bill, just for the internet. Usually, when people get put on hold with other companies, there's a soft music playing on the phone, but when they put you on hold, rock music is blasting in my ear, which is very disrespectful."
"John of Eden Prairie, MN","Sept. 28, 2014",1,I have had intermittent issues connecting to the email server since Thursday night. Two very long phone calls have revealed that it is a nationwide problem that they still can't figure out. I am unable to do important work without email.
"robin of Springfield, OR","Sept. 25, 2014",1,"I am so angry with Comcast it isn't even funny. For the last year I have had intermittent service interruptions with my internet. They have sent me modems, they have sent Techs and nothing seems to fix the problem. Every time I call I get a different answer. In fact the Tech who was here again today had to ask why the modem was acting so crazy saying ""I've never seen it do this before"". The Tech did nothing and I'm just waiting for my internet to go down again. Then I talked to some guy who offered me a $20 credit after I was promised a large credit. Insulting after a year of this. If Comcast and the Time Warner merge goes through we will be screwed. Ma Bell all over again."
"Ruth of Villa Rica, GA","Sept. 25, 2014",1,I have been with Comcast for almost 2 years. Had to get them because they are the only providers of wifi services in the neighborhood I moved into. So I bundled my phone/internet/cable. I am not a heavy user so imagine my surprise when I get a notification that I have used over 300GB for the past 2 months! In fact I was already over 300 just 16 days into the month!!! Their response was perhaps someone hacked my wifi. REALLY! That's your explanation? Felt better that I wasn't crazy when I see it has happened to others. So I called today to cancel my services. Was disconnected 3 different times! So now what? I now have to get a mifi device so I can have internet access in my home. Also I called xfinity back to see what my bill would be if I just kept the wifi and was told it would be 100.00!! How can that be when most plans average about 25.00 a month! How can they charge so much!!!! Something needs to be done about this.
"Derek of Jacksonville, FL","Sept. 23, 2014",1,"I have been a COMCAST customer since moving to Florida after retiring from the navy as a communication chief which only say because I have a good understanding of outages, troubleshooting and customer service. So it stomps me how Comcast via commercials, sales personnel and expect folks to pay top dollar for that they one, cannot consistently provide and two, the customer will not and does not receive. For over 8 months almost a year I have been experiencing intermittent Internet service from Comcast. When I phone to report the outage I would have to wait for 20 minutes just to speak to the 1st rep, who would transfer me around several time. When I get to the Internet people they would be rude condescending and out insult my intelligence. They constantly would make it an issue to shift the blame on me by saying it was my modem which I purchased a new one, my now being hardwired or using my laptop or something of the sort. I got to so frustrated I had repair guys out at least four or five times. My service never worked on command not to mention when I needed it for college. I have been hung up on, notes not placed, transferred to the Philippines. You name it I've experienced it and still was expected to pay for the service. I've contacted their corporate office and left messages for a CT at 9545347115 numerous times and never got a call back. Long story short I was forced to terminate the service out of aggravation and hopelessness after they shut my service off for $40, while I had poor service at full price. I dislike Comcast and they are the actual turtles not the DSL folks, as far as the services they provide. Worthless ripoffs!"
"Nora of Sunset, UT","Sept. 23, 2014",1,I was charged for service when I had cancelled my service AND returned all of my equipment. This is after over a decade of being a customer. I had several experiences of being setup with a completely different package than I had requested. The customer service I received from the outbound collection service was HORRIBLE! I will NEVER go with Comcast again. I aim to find a company that appreciates a loyal customer. They will have the next ten years of my business.
"oscar of Miami, FL","Sept. 22, 2014",1,"In order to place an order took 4 phone calls. 3 times I was put on hold for over 20 minutes and no one ever called me back. On the 4th call I managed to place the order with included some free stuff. LIES... no free stuff. They sent me a confirmation email. All wrong... Many. Set up fee of over $230.00, monthly fee was way off and internet speed was not mentioned as I was assured it would be. As I was moving in AT&T rep approached me with respect, truthfulness and a much sooner installation time, more (2Xs) tv channels, lower monthly payment and a great internet speed. To the Marketing Department from COMCAST you know how much you spend to get a customer hooked up for then to lose it due to the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ever.I just canceled my order with Comcast and they have not had the courtesy or inclination to call me and ask why or if they can do anything for me in order to keep me as a customer. Please be aware that before this experience I was with them for 20 years. They just lost a $200.00 a month, direct deposit account because of my cancellation. I sincerely hope your merger does not come to be. You do not deserve it and neither do your customer base."
"Suan  of Rockville, MD","Sept. 22, 2014",1,"Worst monopoly ever! Worst company. They say internet up to 20 mbps. Never I have in my home that, the most high I was 7 mbps. This one is the deal they really offer ""You will pay for the worst internet, bad customer service."" If you need receive money back, sit and wait because some day you will receive the money. Request technicians may come late and maybe they connect the internet and maybe the internet will work. If you call, sit, relax, take a nap until somebody solution your problem. If they solution your problem."

"nicky of San Francisco, CA","Sept. 18, 2014",1,"Updated on May 29, 2014 at 7:33 PM. Frequently asked questions about our data usage plans. XFINITY Internet customers' median monthly data usage is 20 - 25 GB per month."""
"Peter of Lawrenceville, GA","Sept. 15, 2014",1,"Internet...After more than a year of internet service with Comcast on which I never exceeded the 300GB data usage cap, I was recently notified that I had reached 90% just 14 days into the month of September. This means that somehow my data usage more than doubled. I have not changed any of my internet habits and just me and my wife live in the house. My problem is two-fold: Comcast added the caps January 2014, months after I started the service but did not notify me of the data caps had been added. We have not changed how we use our internet, yet suddenly we are being notified 1/2 way through the month that we are at the cap...they have something wrong in their algorithm somewhere. I HATE COMCAST."
"Alan of Ann Arbor, MI","Sept. 11, 2014",1,"I took delivery of a new Wireless Modem, model # TC8503C, a couple of weeks ago. No problem installing it but after a few days, the wi-fi failed. Required unplugging and plugging it in again to get it to work. I contacted Comcast technical support and they reset the modem, which did not solve the problem. Contacted them a second time and was told to try changing the channel to either channel 6 or 11 and if that didn't work the modem was defective and should be replaced. Well, it didn't solve the problem so called support a 3rd time and was told a replacement would be sent out. After waiting for almost a week and no modem arriving, I contacted them again and was told there was no record stating a new modem would be sent out and they would send a technician out to troubleshoot the problem and replace it if they determined it was in fact defective. This after three calls to tech support who told me it was defective! When I called tech support again, I was told they'd send a replacement out but would be charged for postage even though the unit was defective. This modem is a rental from Comcast and I consider it disgraceful that any charges should apply! I am so totally disgusted with Comcast. If we, in this area, are ever offered another choice of providers, Comcast can kiss me goodbye!!"
"Kevin of Waukegan, IL","Sept. 9, 2014",1,Internet service went down so I called Comcast. It will take 7 days to have a service tech come to my home to fix problem. Stay away from Comcast. I'm dropping them.
"Julie of Wabash, Other","Sept. 4, 2014",1,Comcast lost all of my sent items in my husband's sent box in Xfinity/SmartZone. The technician in the Philippines was not able to find them. Upon escalating the issue it turns out this is a WELL-KNOWN issue in the escalation department and they do not seem to be able to figure out what is happening. Last week we could not send e-mails as the port number changed for no reason. That is the least of our problems now. Technicians said escalation would call us sometime tomorrow between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. expecting me to stay home all day and wait for them to call. They will only make one call. I was finally able to get him to use a call back time frame of 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. for an escalation dept. phone call regarding finding my e-mails. We need an e-mail server we can trust as we are required to use our own e-mail for communication with employers. We need to verify that we communicated with them. Our e-mail setting was set to save to server assuming we could trust the server.
"Sarah of Citrus Heights, CA","Aug. 29, 2014",1,"I moved in to a new apartment in January of this year. Part of the move-in package was a flyer for comcast service, advertising special pricing on their plans for the whole complex. I called in and spoke to a guy who was pretty rude to begin with, and he explained that there was a $30, $40, and $50 options (typical good better best). I chose the $40 plan and he told me the soonest they could come out was a week and half away... Okay... I scheduled the install for as early as they go, 8 am. I had to leave for work by 11. The installer brought a ""trainee"" and had him setup the system instead. Not a big deal, except the guy clearly didn't know what he was doing and they kept running into ""problems with the wiring"" of my apartment. Whatever. It took them 3 hours and 3 separate modems to find one that was compatible with my apartment. Funny, I thought they worked with the whole complex? My first bill was $130. This apparently was including a $15 per hour rate for each installer. NOT OKAY. Second bill, $50. What?? I went along paying it, happy to just have the internet, until July when my bills went up to $75. I could NOT afford that. At that point, my roommate had bailed on our lease and I was paying everything by myself anyways. I opened a chat with a rep and they told me I was on a ""promotional period"" that was only for 6 months. I read over all my paperwork from my install and my bills and nowhere, freaking nowhere, did it ever say promotional or mention what my bills would be afterwards. I still had two months on my lease so I couldn't cancel, but I was pissed. I called in finally this week to cancel (they advertise 24/7 service but not for their cancellation dept) and spoke to a rep. Nicest person I talked to in the whole experience, and also an idiot. He repeated questions, took twenty minutes for the whole process, and kept asking me about my personal life and why I was moving. He also told me that I was going to be billed for the month I moved out anyways?? Comcast is billing me $75 for the month of September after I called and said my last day will be August 31st. He said they will send me a check with the amount left after what service I used. I'M NOT USING IT THE WHOLE MONTH??? What the hell!! Greedy jerks is all I can say."
"Tracie of Madison Township, PA","Aug. 25, 2014",1,"We just got Comcast in March and ever since then it's been a nightmare. They have messed up our bill so bad that they don't even know how to fix it. I wrote to that Tom K's office and every time you try to talk to the first person you spoke with they can never get you to that person. They are overcharging our account by about $300. The first man we spoke within Tom K's office supposedly took care of everything and credited our account. Guess what, he didn't. I think this company should be banned. They have the rudest customer service reps I have ever dealt with. They hang up on you when you want a supervisor. We did find a way to have someone call you back within an hour, take the survey and give them bad marks. They call immediately and want to know why you gave them low scores. I think there should be a class action law suit brought against them because it sounds like they do this to everybody."
"Beverly of Beverly, MA","Aug. 23, 2014",1,"Worst customer service EVER. I spent four hours on the phone with six people on two continents over the course of three days, trying to fix an internet problem that it turned out THEY caused. I then spent another hour with three more people trying to get the $110 worth of fees they'd landed me with (for the problem they caused) removed from my bill. The reps, or laughably named ""account executives,"" are worse than useless. The first two I spoke with had no suggestions at all besides ""unplug it and then plug it back in"". With the first, I could hear other people coaching him from the background. The third flat-out lied to me to get me off the phone. I didn't get the same answers from any two reps, and as it turned out, none of the answers they gave me were right anyway. If Comcast is allowed to merge with Time-Warner, it will be a kick in the face to every customer in the country. As far as I can tell, the only reason most people are signed on with Comcast is because there is no other option. It's certainly the case with me - I'd leave in a heartbeat if there was any other service provider in my area."
"Kimberly of Goose Creek, SC","Aug. 21, 2014",1,"Internet went out on Monday August 18th. I immediately called Comcast and was promised by the rep that someone would be out the following day to repair it. Today is Thursday, August 21st and yes you guessed it... still no internet. I have called Comcast 7 times. I was told yesterday to go to my local Comcast office to get a new modem. They said the one I had wasn't working properly. I did all that and yes, you guessed it, still no internet. I told them several times that I work from my computer. It really doesn't matter what you tell them. TheyŠ—Ère so backed up w/ service calls that people are waiting 2 to 3 weeks. Absolutely unacceptable!"
"M of Philadelphia, PA","Aug. 20, 2014",1,"I was going to launch a rant on the Comcast monopoly but, at my advanced age, I couldn't do better than J of Beaverton, OR. I will only add that, at the very least, there is a hint of fraud in Comcast ""Customer Service"" business practices. Every single call goes 30 mins+. An hour is not uncommon. They just wear customers down until they stop seeking regress."
"T. of Cordova, TN","Aug. 20, 2014",1,"They started charging us per usage. It was fine at 300G a month. Then last month, it skyrocketed (even though we had one laptop, two iPhones and an iPad) which was less than the normal 2 laptops, on desktop. We don't use our wireless for our phones and make sure nothing is running in background. We have had these phones for over a year and never went over. We also had two desktops, two laptops, one iPad, and Netflix (no, it's not running unless we say ok to access), yet it jumped from 245G to over 365G within days. Now I suppose everyone must be a complete moron when it comes to calling Comcast. These customer service reps are usually from the Philippines. Not only is there service crap but they take away money to provide jobs to us in the US. Now it took almost a year and a half the first time we complained about slow internet. They sent guys out at least 4 times... Each one pretended they were going to fix it because I am just a female. They had no idea what they were talking about... I did... So after about 16 calls complaining and 4 different ""experts"" (you guys should really make sure these people know what they are talking about because the IQ together of these people you sent out was maybe 40). The last guy went out and checked the line. It had water in it (this was the first time). A year and a half later and at least 12 phone calls, another few guys come out. All were idiots... Minus the last one. He took off what you all used to use on the line. I can't for the life of me remember what it was called but it basically made sure we were not able to get above the speed we were promised (Sorry, I can't remember what it's called). He came back in and stated that he removed that cable block because they had not used that in years since they upgraded, yet ours was still there. Worked great for a while. Then Comcast got greedy.They bought out Time Warner so they couldn't compete. So Comcast has monopolized an already crappy city. Living in the only place that hasn't been incorporated into Memphis. They charge what they want. Now I called them when we had gone over our 300g. Mind you again, we only had one computer (laptop), two iPhones (which we don't surf the internet on), and one iPad. When I called, I was told I needed to change my password because hackers can get into it. I am not an idiot. I know all about the hackers, identity, passwords, etc., etc. The guy I spoke with from Comcast was an idiot. He was also rude. Change your password...etc., etc. I can change the password constantly but if you are monitoring what I am using, shouldn't you be able to show what is using it?They provided me with nonsense. I have a great virus/ad ware/security protection, Comcast said get a virus removal, change your password, sell your first born. Comcast, not everyone you deal with is an IDIOT. And again they could not tell me what caused our overage. I told them that considering I have LESS connected last month than the month before, there is no way in H(*& that we went over. This month, I have been the only one home (kids in school, husband at work, dogs do not use computers (unless they are really smart and play when I am sleeping!!!!), no iPads on, no iPhones on, no Netflix, and one laptop), yet I am at 145 G. BTW, we do not have cable with them, we do not have phones with them... It's just the modem. I had a program that showed me who was connected and it never showed anything that was not what was supposed to be connected. I believe Comcast decided to do this because they don't want to upgrade to handle the load. They throttle and/or they just decide to make it slow. Paying 80 dollars to watch how slow the internet has become or to get an ""it's busy"" is silly. My speed is terrible, I don't want to speak with someone in the Philippines. I almost forgot one night I called and spoke with someone from the Philippines. We were disconnected and I could not get back online. I called back, wasted another 45 minutes to be told that the last lady cancelled my service!!!!! Comcast is getting paid for bad service. Loading pages is the worst.. It's nonsense. If I pay you 80, I expect good service. You are throttling. You want me to pay over 100 for internet service because you monopolized the market here."
"neil of Richmond, IN","Aug. 14, 2014",1,"I was with Comcast for almost 3 years and after my promotion was up my bill continued to get higher. So I decided to not pay them and let them shut me off. After my services were shut off I paid them $561 to clear my debt or so I thought. They sent me another bill saying I owed $158. This is ridiculous! They are supposed to shut you off after 2 months of no payment and I thought $561 was a bit high, but my anger went through the roof when they sent me another bill. Never again will I go through this business."
"Jodi of Cherry Hill, NJ","Aug. 13, 2014",1,"After many years of happy service with Fios, I was forced into Comcast's clutches when I moved to an area that doesn't support Fios. I spent hours on the phone with 2 people (1) dumb and (1) dumber setting up my plan, and I had to call back and speak to someone to correct their mistakes on the order. Just when I thought I was in the clear, I receive my 1st Bill and find a $150 Deposit Fee on it. I called kicking and screaming but all I got was lip service and apologies for the previous (3) people not telling me. I thought for a short second that maybe they really made a mistake when I found this systemic problem written about all other the web. Rip Off, Stupid, and downright Liars is what I have to look forward to. Fios please come to Leisuretowne Community in Southampton. I need you so badly."
"lisa of Reston, VA","Aug. 12, 2014",1,WE signed a contract with them. NEVER EVER DO THAT. They said the penalty was paying for the whole contract period. Never ever get their business service. When we moved they LIED and said we had to sign another LONGER contract to not pay a penalty. THEY LIE.
"J of Beaverton, OR","Aug. 8, 2014",1,"The most hated company in the country, and nothing is being done to change their abuse of customers. Worst customer service ever. When I called today, to make a payment through the automated system, it processed a payment for the full balance, instead of the past due amount, because it misunderstood my ""NO"" for a ""YES"". The automated system did not verify the amount I was committing to pay, and processed the full payment. I talked to a rep & a supervisor in the financial department within 2 minutes, and because it was done through the automated system, their hands were tied. They offered to credit back the current charges, within 2 weeks.When you call customer service, with each representative, you have to verify more information about yourself, than I do when I call a bank. But, the automated system doesn't even confirm the amount you're paying before it is processed, and to process a payment with a customer service person, charges a fee. I am beyond angry. Last year, I canceled all cable television. I don't want to spend money to watch repetitive tv, and reality tv while being smothered in commercials during the programming and even within the television shows themselves. I also don't want to spend my valuable downtime getting wrapped up in a new series that gets canceled after one or two seasons (this generally happens with the shows I like the most). So, I use Netflix and Amazon Prime, and I don't watch new series until they have 3 seasons available. Because of this choice, I need high speed internet. The only choice of company for quality high speed internet is Comcast.After talking with them today, I immediately began looking at other internet providers and reviews from their customers. Unfortunately, I'm still stuck with Comcast, and at this point, I am so frustrated with paying a company that abuses its customers that I am seriously considering canceling internet service, and just reading books, going to movies, and using my cellphone limitedly to access the internet for news and information. My local libraries never leave me feeling this angry, and I don't pay them for using their books, videos, or internet."
"shanna of North Fort Myers, FL",41851,1,"I cannot connect to internet and my equipment is fine. No problem there and my account balance is paid every month but Comcast's internet service is down most of the time. I have been a customer for a couple of years and I have complained to Comcast numerous times in the past but get no satisfaction. Now this time, the internet has been mostly down for a week and I can only use the internet for about 20 minutes a day if I am lucky. All my equipment is new and up to date just like Comcast ask me to do but I am still having problems. This has been and is a common routine and Comcast does not give a damn. I am sick of paying for services that I cannot use and I cannot afford the installation fees for another company. I think customers should get some kind of notice and/or explanation for why service is down and when it will be up again and I think they should give customers some kind of credit for services they cannot and have not been able to use for a week or more."
"ANNA of Rohnert Park , CA",41851,1,The network keeps dropping me at 30 minute intervals. It's difficult to stream anything because the router needs to be reset 2-3 times every night. So frustrated at the audacity of Comcast to claim to be the best internet provider when they don't deliver.
"Sonja of Auburn, WA",41847,1,"Comcast has been a thorn in my side for years. When I changed service from my previous address but left it connected and transferred to my roommate 6 years ago, it took 4 months to get the $150 over I had paid (because I pay my bills before they are due - well never again with them). I have continuous problems through the years with my internet connection (I pay for top of the line). Then amazingly when I call them and complain suddenly they stop slowing it down. I have reset my router 3 times in the last 24 hours and still was having spotty connection, until suddenly when I logged on here, my Netflix works again. Think I am paranoid - no, I know how these big businesses behave, and they are very capable of tracking all of the data and calls (why do you think the government gets information from them?)."
"Frank of Beachwood, NJ",41847,1,"I began having issues with my internet from day 1, but recently was the best of the worst. I had issues for about 15 days straight, and had 'bullets' sent to my modem at least once a day. So about 10 days ago a tech came over. Now since I disconnected my modem overnight the stupid thing decided to work when the tech connected it. I asked for a replacement since it was at least 10 years old and he wouldn't so it wouldn't come up as a service call which made no sense at all. Today I called, wasted 35 minutes and tomorrow they will replace it, only because I didn't want to waste my time driving 20 miles round trip, or want to pay a fee to have it mailed. Why would I pay a fee when they told me itŠ—Ès an outdated piece of equipment. I am paying good money plus insurance to have proper service. You want me to go pick it up? Have it closer to me. Comcast is the worst. I am seriously thinking about FiOS just to get some upgrades for a few years. By then maybe some good from NY might come down."
"Al of Cumming, GA",41843,1,"Comcast charges me $150 for one month internet access. Claim I had used over 600 gb of data. Prior to Jan. 1, average usage was <300 gb.

"Mimi of Brooklyn Park, MN",41842,1,"I sold my business and want to cancel Comcast. They still charge me for the cancellation fee, and their reason is ""we still provide service to you""?!?

Their internet has been failure almost every month. TV service doesn't work. Phone line is bad. I will cancel contract with Comcast by the end of this year and never recommend any friends of mine to Comcast again."
"James of Harriman, TN",41839,1,"This is the post I put on my personal Facebook page 7-17-2014. I'm posting on the Comcast corporate Facebook page as a warning to anyone considering Comcast as an internet/cable provider. Also to offer legal proof that I am aware of my bill behind due 7-20-2014 but will not make a payment until my bill is adjusted correctly. Any attempt to charge me a late charge for not paying an incorrect and probably illegal charge will be documented also. I have given Comcast ample time to correct this error and have been met with total disregard.Update: I paid $120 to Comcast today 7-19-2014 which is less than they say I owe but more than I actually owe. I told them to put a note on my file that I was disputing the charges. Only time will tell if I'm charged a late fee or not. Well alright then, here is the scoop on my Comcast saga. It will soon become obvious why they have taken control of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE of any corporation in America.6-1-2014 @ 7:39pm - Called Comcast Customer Service (19 minute call) to report a problem with my internet and they scheduled a service call from between 8:00 and 10:00 am on 6-6-2014. 6-6- 2014 @ 2:00 pm the Comcast serviceman arrived 4 hours later than scheduled. Was unable to fix the problem, but was told I would have $20 credited to my account for them being late.6-7-2014 @ 9:38 am called Comcast back (26 minute call) to say I was still having problems with internet service. Was able to talk to an intelligent person who updated the router firmware which fixed the problem. He also, because of the problem the day before and the continuing problem that he fixed, offered to double my internet speed and lower my bill from $140 a month to $90 a month for a year. I agreed and checking on speakeasy found that my speed had, in fact doubled. 7-14-2014 Went online to pay my bill and it was for $267.95.7-16-2014 Drove to local Comcast office to discuss bill. Was told that they were unable to make any changes in the bill, but the girl did itemize the bill and said at least $67.75 was a double billing and was an error. She gave me a number to call. At 4:20 pm called Comcast billing (46 minute call), the first person I talked to said that the bill was correct and there was nothing they could do about it. When I mentioned the $67.75 double charge, they acknowledged it was an error, but said that they weren't authorized to fix it. I asked them to connect me with someone who was authorized to fix it. The next person was a little more helpful, but said that they were unable to do anything either and that I would have to talk to someone in Customer Satisfaction. The first thing this person told me was that the bill was correct and that I would have to pay it. When I asked her about the $67.75, like the other people before her, she acknowledged that it was incorrect, but she didn't have the authority to remove the charge. I went over the previous story about how I changed my service to get the lower rate and her response was, ""Well, honey, you are getting a significant discount for what you are getting."" I told her that I was only interested in getting service for less than what I was already paying and not more. After 30 minutes I was able to finally get her to remove all of the extra services to where it was before, however she was unable to get the $67.75 removed. (WTH?)7-17-2014 After checking my bill today the charges had dropped to $176.25 which is still more than my usual bill of $140.00 and since I was somehow supposed to have an additional $20 removed for them being late on 6-6, they are charging me at least $50.00 over. I called Comcast again (19 minutes)and got someone who sounded like Garrison Keillor. (without being too prejudiced, I imagine him to be an Episcopalian carrying a Costco card). The first words from his mouth were, ""well sir, I see we've already given a significant amount of credits to your account."" That was enough. I demanded to talk to one of his supervisors. He said wait a minute and put me on hold. Five minutes later he came back on and said a supervisor was about ready to talk. Five more minutes later he said that I should wait another day or two and that the credits should appear on my bill. I told him that I wanted it put on my account that if it wasn't below $120.00 by the time the bill was due that I was not going to pay anything and that I would be bringing my modem/router and cable box back to Comcast. He said he would do that."
"Irene of Newbury, MA",41837,1,"I had to smile at the latest public exposure of Comcast's attitude toward customers (The viral bit about the customer trying to cancel his account). Actually, the smile came when I read Comcast's public statement about this latest fiasco. The response was supposedly written by Tom Karinshak, Senior VP - Customer Experience. I've heard numerous people saying they feel sorry for the agent involved in this debacle because he was most likely only doing as told by his superiors. I suspect there is truth in this assumption.Our problems with Comcast began over two years ago (TV and Internet). After months of trying to get someone at Comcast to care about our problems, I contacted Corporate. They assigned a senior level employee (their word) to help. This was almost a year ago. Since then, numerous techs have come out to ""fix"" our problems. Each tech finds something s/he says is the cause of all our issues. The ""something"" is fixed and the tech leaves. An hour or two later, the issues reoccur. Comcast keeps sending out senior techs who find new problems and ""fix"" them. At this point, they have replaced just about every part of the system and yet the service issues remain. Meanwhile, getting anyone at the Company to respond to e-mail or telephone calls takes days and even weeks. Keep in mind, by now we are dealing with people at the Corporate level, not the low level field reps.We are very frustrated and fed-up. Every month the bill must be paid, but no one seems to care that we lose channels in mid-program or that our Internet connection is often slower than old-fashioned dial-up. A month ago, we sent another letter to Mr. Karinshak explaining our frustration. We have heard nothing. However, after talking with friends and doing some online research, I now understand why. Mr. Karinshak may be in charge of customer experience, but he never sees any negative feedback. He is so well insulated from customers he has little or no idea how poorly his company is fulfilling the terms of the ""customer guarantee.""([I'm not sure you can call mere words a guarantee!) If Mr. Karinshak wants to know how his company is performing, I suggest he make himself more accessible. Read the forum posts. Allow customers to e-mail him directly. Spend some time in the field listening to customers. Not all of us are cranks or people bent on dragging a company through the mud and muck. Some of us are simply frustrated and desperate to be heard by someone who will effect meaningful change."
"Kathy of Wheaton, IL",41836,1,"So many hidden charges in their $119 bundle. My first bill was $370! My salesperson promised 3 different times to correct it. Yea, not so much. Still fighting with them while they keep adding late charges. My internet went out and they came to change box. Guy told me they recycle boxes and can't count on them to be functional. We were out of service 5 days, had to wait for service window (1-4:00) and then they charged me for service call. I am currently waiting for another service call for home security. It's been out for 10 days. So sick of the bs. HATE this company."
"Jon of Mexico, MS",41835,1,"I got my internet speed check and highest it got was 0.02 at 3:00pm - 2:30am and at the middle of the morning I get to 3.00 internet speed, so that mean I cannot go on internet unless I want to stay up all night."
"saeed of Atlanta, GA",41825,1,"We had Comcast service but I noticed that our bill almost doubled at one month. I paid that since I didn't have time to discuss with Comcast people. You know how painful is that since they really don't understand simple math. The next month, surprisingly, the bill quadrupled and I stopped paying that and service suspended for a month. Today, I tried to check the account and spend some time to solve the issue with customer service and, surprisingly, I noticed that Comcast has kept charging and overcharging us while the service was suspended. This is absolutely unacceptable. I wanted to contact the law office of our college to sue this company. They may have overcharged a lot of people as well and this is a big fraud."
"G. of Batavia, IL",41824,1,"I was billed incorrectly in May of 2014 for 399.99 first installation charge. I HAD NO NEW INSTALLATION. MY XFINITY HOME WAS INSTALLED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2013 AND PAID FOR! I have repeatedly contacted Comcast several times a week, have been transferred, left on permanent hold and hung up on, promised credit several times, promised call backs. I can't believe they can get away with this! Someone has to be able to do something about them... Please!!!"
"P. of Huntsville, AL",41822,1,"In March 2014, I got something in the mail that offered my a $200.00 if I switch my cable and internet service to Comcast. In the fine print it stated that I would have to be customer for 90 days. July 02, 2014. I called about the VISA gift card ($200.00), I was told I would not get it. I pay my bill on time each month. When I attempted to call anyone at Comcast each person doesn't have any idea what I'm talking about. I have been hang up on 3 times and have been on the phone with Comcast since 10am and it's now 10:53 am in my area. Please beware of this ""so called DEAL"". I have ask them to disconnected my services. The company (Comcast) has told me I would have to pay a disconnection fee. On top of me not getting the gift card I was promise. I now hate Comcast. The integrity of this Company is shot with me. I just want out and have nothing else to do with Comcast."
"Bob of Mobile, AL",41819,1,"6/21, internet stops working. Call Comcast service line. Talk with someone who apologizes for the inconvenience. Determines that the modem (supplied by Comcast) is not working. Says they can send someone on 6/24. I explain that I work on the Internet and that I cannot be out of touch for that long. Person apologizes again and says they will escalate the trouble ticket and I will hear from someone on 6/22 by noon. Noon on 6/22 comes and goes and I hear from no one. Call Comcast again. Supervisor apologizes again and says the the escalation was denied but that I will hear from someone at Comcast by 10 am on 6/23. 10 am on 6/23 comes and goes, and another call to Comcast and another supervisor apologizes for the inconvenience. This supervisor ""guarantees"" that someone from Comcast will call and that a service person will come to my house by the end of the day on 6/23, but just to make sure, I have an appointment for a service call between 3 and 5 pm on 6/24. You guess it - no call and no service on 6/23, but service tech does come to my house at 4 pm on 6/24 and ""fixes"" the Internet problem. By this time, I have spent more than 2 and a half hours on the telephone with Comcast. Fast forward a few days to 6/27, and internet is out again. Another call to Comcast, another apology for the inconvenience. Supervisor promises service by midday on 6/28, but, no surprise, no one shows. Another call to Comcast, another apology for the inconvenience and another promise that someone will call between 10 am and noon on 6/29 to arrange to fix the problem. No one calls or fixes anything and another call to Comcast and another apology for the inconvenience. This time, no promise of quick service (I think by now they figure I have caught on that they can make all the promises they want and I can't do anything if the promise is not kept; so why bother), but there will be a service person here between 8 and 10 am on 7/1. I'll believe it when I see it. It's pretty clear that there is a disconnect between the folks who take your call for service and the people who actually fix things and Comcast just as clearly doesn't seem concerned about that disconnect. Oh, and when I called and asked for a credit for the service that I'm paying for and not getting, then Comcast offered to sell me some additional services. Sounds like a good deal!"
"Meg of Moraga, CA",41819,1,"I have noticed over the past few weeks that internet service fails EVERY evening now, starting at about 7 pm. I have to reboot the modem and just cross my fingers that I can get access again to continue watching TV and to complete work I took home from the office. It's the REGULARITY of the outage that frustrates me. I am going to look for any other internet service provider - if anyone launches a class-action lawsuit over the lack of service we have paid for, count me in. Unless, of course, the 1% has rigged the system and we 99%ers can no longer petition for relief via class action suits."
"Richard of Northampton, MA",41810,1,"As has happened with others, I received a letter urging me to upgrade my modem. The letter stated, in the fourth paragraph: ""To protect our environment, please properly recycle your older modem... Please note that there is no unreturned equipment fee for your older modem."" Then, on my latest bill, I received a monthly charge for this modem. When I called, I was essentially told ""Too bad, you have to return it or face monthly charges."""
"LESLIE of Marietta, GA",41809,1,"Had my internet service mysteriously stop working a week ago while listening to Pandora. Think Comcast gives two craps about correcting problem as promised to a customer of many years- think again! I knew something was up many months ago when my internet kept going out & losing its IP address or default gateway constantly plus having modems replaced twice in barely a year. And I was always told it was ""interference in my own home"" & not any fault of theirs. Oh & also recently supposedly some interference in MY house was creating interference with ""other neighbors' service"" that required them to come in my house- but at last minute they decided wasn't necessary without further comment- maybe cause I made it clear I didn't wish to upgrade like they wanted. It's all in the news now and all part of a game of greed on their part to use your home internet signals that YOU pay dearly for monthly to fuel their big project of ""providing alleged secure wifi hotspots"" that have been shown by experts to not be totally secure & unhackable. Glad I moved on to use another carrier & not wait for it to hit the fan & have my computer hacked. Comcast got too high & mighty for their pants & it will come back to bite them in the end & I will be laughing (with working service & much better customer service) when karma comes around!"
"c. of Salt Lake City, UT",41807,1,"Comcast SERVICE is atrocious. They raise prices monthly. I have been a customer for 10 years and I have to wait 3 weeks for service? I broke my pelvis and asked Comcast to deliver an HD box and install it so I can watch TV downstairs since I can't walk upstairs. I am flat on my back. Multiple calls got me nowhere. They cannot come until 3 weeks. What is wrong with them? They suck all this money off their customers and when I ask for 1 service, which I have to pay for they give me an appointment 3 weeks later. All begging and asking resulted in nothing.Their internet services is flawed. They charge for tiny boxes I received 10 years ago monthly 9.95. So I like to get tv downstairs because I am in a wheelchair and can't go upstairs and voila I have to wait 3 weeks. THIS IS UNHEARD OF. They are monopolizing the market and therefore don't care for real customer service. It's totally not fair. They moved it to the 28th of June, 11 days from now. Why can't they offer a simple service to a customer who really is just laying there and unable to go to a store and get the box?"
"Ray of Nashville, TN",41805,1,"X1 box locks up, no response to remote control, internet gateway restarts intermittently. TV picture pixelated so badly it can't be watched. Comcast's fix is ""reboot"" that fixes nothing."
"Carrie of Milton, DE",41804,1,"Earlier this year we upgraded our internet service. We have been plagued with lag spikes ever since. We game, stream, and download virtual products regular. We have a top of the line router. Prior to upgrading our connection, we began to experience daily disconnections during peak hours. Comcast suggested upgrading when we complained, so we did.I can't tell you what's worse - good speeds with daily outages or fluctuating speeds and weekly outages. There have been days when our speeds are 15kb/s. If I could change to another broadband ISP, I'd have no hesitation. I'd even pay more if meant leaving Comcast in the dust. My European friends laugh at my expensively slow internet..."
"Craig  of Minnetonka, MN",41803,1,"When I attempt to reply to an email the text block fills with hundreds of garbage characters. They cannot be erased. When I hit the reply icon on their toolbar the entire toolbar becomes inoperable and nothing is sent. Their Customer Service does not comprehend the problem. They read through a script that has nothing to do with the issue. They will not let me talk to a supervisor, nor a resident U.S. citizen, nor an email expert. My email has been inoperable for a month. No one there listens or cares or does anything about the problem."
"mike of Saint Paul, MN",41803,1,"This is the third time in a month that I've had a negative experience with Comcast. The first time was when I was moving, had an issue, called them twice, sat on hold, got hung up on, and then the same thing happened again the following week. I am now unable to access my email even though I never changed my password and they told me a technician would call me from 5-9 last night, never called, and I have no email."
"Jessica of Chico, CA",41802,1,"To be honest, I am frustrated at the lack of customer service and what seems to be poor communication within the Comcast Company. From March 1st until the end of May, I did not receive Comcast Internet service because of ongoing and unresolved issues. During this time, I still paid anywhere from $48-$79 per month. The Internet was shutting off multiple times a day, leaving a small window of an hour or so to use it. We would attempt to reset the modem, check for loose cables, stop and restart everything, but most times this did not work. When that was the case, I had to call the Comcast office and have them restart our modem from their end. I did this anywhere from 2-7 times a week for three months.Since March 1st, I have called numerous times! I have called to have a technician come out and check the internet connection at least four times, I have called to have assistance restarting our modem 30+ times, I have gone in to exchange our modem twice, and I have even called to attempt to resolve our billing 6+ times. It took THREE MONTHS and EIGHT DAYS, for the Internet issues to even begin being resolved! I feel that I have been paying a company to lie to me in order to placate my anger while they do nothing to resolve the issues. Here is a short summary of my life with Comcast in the last three months:Îà Went to the Comcast office to try two new modems. Problem unresolved and monthly bill is raised.I have noticed my service bill has gone up since April 1st. I do not understand nor do I want to pay since I have not received any services promised for March, April or May. When I call, I am told a supervisor is not in, they are on a trip, and they are too busy to answer my call. I called the billing department around May 28th and was promised that a supervisor would be calling me back no later than June 4th to resolve the issue. This never happened. I called back in an attempt to have the conversation I was promised and was told that my credits are on hold and a supervisor is not in at the moment to discuss it further. Many times I have been told that I will get a credit on my account but this is never given. It wasn't until I spoke with someone from the Loyalties department that I was finally helped with my billing. This was, however, after I threatened to cancel my service due to the employee demeaning and accusing me! I am unimpressed."
"Amin of Allston, MA",41794,1,"I am a client of Comcast Business Internet for the past 4 years. A couple of days ago, they performed a migration from Microsoft Exchange 2007 to Microsoft Exchange 2010. They sent me an email stating that this migration will be performed on Sat night 11pm to 7am Sun (May 31, 2014 to June 1, 2014) at which time my internet services will be interrupted. However, when the service was resumed on Sunday night (much later than they said in their email), I found that they had changed my server address (which ends in comcast.net). This change in server address had a drastic effect on my Business Contact Manager within MS Outlook. It literally made it impossible for me to access my list of business contacts and their information. Over the past 4 years, I had built a list of 2,250 email subscribers and my whole business is dependent on this list. I have called their technical support list for several times now and their reps keep saying they have passed this ticket to their Tier 2 tech and they will be calling me. But I have not heard a word from Comcast's Tier 2 tech support. I feel I've been sidelined and abandoned. They created a big problem for me with this migration and now they don't want to assist in resolving this matter. Almost all of the Comcast reps I have spoken to seem to be passing the buck, claiming the problem is with me or with Microsoft.I wish these tech reps at Comcast will stop dilly dallying and get back to me promptly to resolve this huge problem that they had created due to their negligence. They failed to consider the consequences on changing the server settings on the Business Contact Manager in MS Outlook of their clients. What is really frustrating for me is that no one from their Tier 2 tech support called me up to now. Today is the 3rd day I am waiting. They just kept me waiting like they don't care. On the other hand, I am so anxious and desperate that I restraint myself from going to the bathroom as I don't want to miss their call. I am even eating my meals at the computer table so I don't miss the call from them. They have put me in so much stress for the past 3 days and they seem like they just don't care."
"Kristy of Cordova, TN",41793,1,"I requested to have home phone service / internet service transferred to my new address. Tech was out yesterday to install phone/internet service. Several hours after service was installed my alarm system went off and wouldn't stop (all night). I contacted Comcast to advise them of this issue. I was placed on hold for over 10 mins to get nothing resolved. I called again to get my issue addressed and was asked how long had I been a customer.. (not sure what that has to do with anything). I ask for a credit for my inconvenience and was told I would receive for the days without phone service. I guess I will have to foot the bill for the alarm company ""false calls"" minutes used on my cell phone. I spoke with a lead and a mgr that transferred me to another dept (not sure why). This has got to be the WORST company ever..... I'm glad I spoke with Jenny and she was glad to help me.. I'm still not sure when or if my phone service will be repaired."
"Dennis of Kent, WA",41782,1,"Ordered Comcast on April 28th internet and television. Quote was $116.00 a month for the first year. Comcast mailed a defective box for a $15.00 self install. I called tech support and they sent out a tech guy who simple replaced their defective box. I was told by the Comcast technician, there would be no extra charge for this call. Next, an email arrives saying my monthly bill will be $220.00 per month. I called their billing department, am told the email is wrong and my actual bill is going to be $127.79 per month.A month later, an email arrives and tells me I am being billed $320.00. Called their billing department and was told this was for April 28 until the end of June. That is 2 months and 3 days. The $15.00 self install morphed into a $92.00 service call. I asked for a supervisor and was told there was none available but I would receive a call back today. Of course that never happened. My days are numbered at Comcast."
"Dale of Jacksonville, FL",41776,1,"I have repeatedly tried to use the Xfinity numerous times. The service is very, very unstable, with one exception: the commercials play flawlessly. Must be nice to be a monopoly. In case you haven't realized already, I DESPISE Comcast."
"mofan of Silver Spring, MD",41775,1,"I moved into apartment and called Comcast for setting up internet. They told me the old tenant didn't disconnect the account and I had to wait. It's totally not my fault and why I have to wait for such a long time. Before that, whenever I called the local service, the reply were always voice mail box. And I sent about ten emails but only got one reply."
"Krissy of Fort Lauderdale, FL",41774,1,"My feedback on Comcast/Xfinity is that it sucks!!!!! The customer service is horrible, and nobody seems to know what they are doing. I was on live chat with a girl earlier today and she literally took 6-7 minutes in between each question that I asked her only to come back not answering the question at all. I got so frustrated with her that I disconnected with her and called in. The people in the billing department were just as rude and horrible. I was told since I got your service in December that my installation fee of $66.50 was only for 3 months which I paid and it shows that on my paper. However, today a lady told me that she don't know who told me that because my installation for $66.50 is for 6 months. Like WHERE THE HELL did that come from? After arguing back and forth with her I decided to do what was best and CANCEL my services. I can't keep dealing with LIES from Comcast representatives/Comcast in general. Not only are they RUDE but NO ONE seems to know what they are doing!!!!!! OH AND DID I SAY RUDE, RUDE, RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND BILLING DEPARTMENT!"
"Ron of Aurora, CO",41749,2,"Internet locks up, after calling Comcast the service goes to working fine. My wife witnessed this after I got off the phone with them and the internet locked up again. They said it was my computer, lies lies lies. This happens many times on a consecutive basis and they are in denial about the service. I have proof that the fiber optic light is being split as one line goes to comcast and the other to the FEDS.. DATA manipulation is what is going on. This is wrong, this is a service we are paying for and it's costing a lot of money for the Delusional feds to abuse the consumers this way."
"Erik of Auburn, WA",41742,2,"Over the years, I have had half a dozen different internet service providers. The most inconsistent internet signal and unhelpful technical support has been, by far, courtesy of Comcast. Rarely will I go more than an hour without having internet service slow to next-to-nothing or drop out completely. I have tried contacting customer service, but their ""solutions"" seem like they are just buying time to drop a charged service call on you that I would never expect to make anything better. Since everyone I know that uses Comcast has the same connectivity issues as I do, I'm going to use some deductive reasoning and conclude that the service is just bad and nothing will ever be done about it as long as they are the only high-speed internet service option. Enjoy your horrible reputation and piles of cash, Comcast."

"Selina of Florence, AL",41721,1,"After having Comcast/Xfinity internet service over 7 years, I received a notice saying they had failed to charge me rental for my modem for that 7 years and I would now be charged $7 for it. The very modem they gave me 7 years ago for signing up - 7 years! After an endless battle, I sent them the 7 year old modem and bought a Netgear modem from Best Buy. I thought this would solve the problem - wrong. For the past 4 months, I have had to call each month to have the $7 rental removed. Each month, the rep claims the problem is resolved. Just noticed I was charged again! They obviously aren't concerned with their customers and the needless irritations they create with pathetic attempts to bring in a few more dollars!"
"Christine of Spring, TX",41721,1,"Filed complaint with the BBB. Outsourced customer service is inept & inefficient. Give the runaround & excuses instead of service. Had service connectivity issues for a long time. Each time I called, ""there was an outage"". The issues are consistent throughout the day; intermittent & stops every couple of minutes. A 90-min movie takes 3-4 hours to play out.I called March 19 to request a service technician visit, which was then scheduled for Friday, March 21. We had stayed home all day to accommodate the huge window of ""sometime between 12p-5p."" We received a call about noon from the Service operators & were told a technician would arrive at 2:45p. We asked to receive a call when they were on their way. We received neither. No call, no technician. When I called later that evening, I spent 2 hours on the phone with customer service in Manila, Philippines... From 6:45p-7p, spoke to Robert who could not get my information correct, after repeating my number numerous times. I asked him to update my information, he did not. I asked to speak to a supervisor, spoke to Pao. He gave the reason a technician did NOT come out because we didn't answer the phone when the technician called 3 times. We never received a call from a technician, & regardless, there was someone at the house the entire day. At 7:30p we were finally given an ""Escalated Ticket Report"" which ""guaranteed"" that a technician would call us back by 7:50P to schedule a visit the following morning-service ticket #**. We were reassured to call back if that didn't happen and speak to Pao directly. We received no such call.At 7:55p, I call back & they had NOT updated my information to get through the long menu & maze of prompts. They had a number that had not existed for over 10 yrs which we have requested changed NUMEROUS times before, as well as over 10 times this same evening. Finally reached rep Dana. Seems no one at Comcast listens very well because she AGAIN asked me for my information numerous times. I asked to speak to Pao, she said that it was impossible because she didn't know who that was & there is no way to transfer calls, track, nor locate anyone in any way (he said he was a supervisor). I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager because I have been on the phone for over 2 hours & don't want to spend the entire evening on hold. She put me on hold & never came back. I hung up at 8:24p - that's THIRTY MINUTES ON HOLD with no follow-up.I called AGAIN at 8:24p, quite upset. I reached Nick. When I asked politely to speak to a manager because I have an issue that must be escalated, he disconnected the call without another word. We are paying $130/month for this service & this was NOT proper customer care at all. Relentless to resolve the issue, I called back yet AGAIN at 8:27p. Spoke to Kalhan who said we had no such ""escalated ticket report"" in progress. Took my number to ""call back in case we were disconnected"". Very nicely, she was ""scheduling a technician"", said it was the most urgent of requests, gave me a service #**. THEN she said it was a WAITING list for a POTENTIAL call from a technician by noon the next day, asserting that a call was NOT GUARANTEED. I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager that could escalate it & give me something more precise. At 9:03,she disconnected the call.I waited 10 minutes for the promised call back in case of disconnection that never came. This seems to be a VERY COMMON practice at COMCAST. Called back at 9:13p; spoke to Hendrick who quoted the reason the technician didn't come was because there was a ""power outage"" (a different story than what previous excuses were) which cancelled service calls. He prepared yet ANOTHER ticket #**. Promised that we would get a call before midnight to plan the service visit the next morning. Promised follow-up callback in 3 hrs which never happened. This is a ""24-hour service"". I've now had contact with 6 service staff members who have done NOTHING but disconnect calls w/ no result."
"Ananth of Aurora, IL",41720,1,"My Comcast Account number was ** and I had disconnected all my services as of 10/29/2013. Earlier I had Double play (cable and Internet) and the bill for the same services up to 10/08 to 11/07 ($89.99+$21.93+tax = $115.91) was paid on 10/25/2013. I had disconnected the cable on 10/25/2013 so in billing from Comcast dated 11/2/2013 (total bill of $16.18), the partial refunds were issued for prorated period between 10/25 to 11/07 for Double play. The internet service was changed as XFINITY High Speed Internet with the net monthly charge of $44.99 (11/8 to 12/7) and also charged for the adjusted period of 14 days (10/25 to 11/07) for $29.33-$9.01 = $20.32 with net total of $65.31 for High Speed Internet service from 10/25 to 12/07.Then I also disconnected the XFINITY High Speed Internet service on 10/29/2013 but the final bill I received on 11/21/2013 had issued the refund for as High Speed Internet only from 11/21 to 12/07 and the refund for the XFINITY High Speed Internet for period between 10/29 and 11/20 is missing which might worth around $40. Even though the representatives agree that my High Speed Internet was disconnected on 10/29, they are wrongly claiming that I have received the full refund which is not true and is totally incorrect.When asked about it, the account rep is confusing with actual order date and completed disconnection date... and also rep is saying that there is no additional charges... and I have not paid for that period and the bill is correct and can't issue the refund. Even I explained I am receiving a refund for Internet services I had paid up to 12/7 but the refund is issued only from 11/21 to 12/7 instead of the actual cancellation date of 10/29 to 12/7. I am not disputing the bill. The bill has issued a refund for me from 11/21 to 12/7 but the actual refund should have been from 10/29 to 12/7. Why no one is able to get this simple issue cleared out and issue a proper and correct refund and how many customers are being cheated like this.What am I missing here? I was on the phone with reps may be more than 10 times for a total of around 6 to 8 hrs...but no use. Why this treatment? They agree that I called for disconnecting my service on 10/29 but trying to come up with various weird reasons to deny my eligible prorated correct refund."
"patricia of Englewood, FL",41705,1,"They would not credit one day of 3 years of bad service. They told me to use my internet that I had to buy a splitter and router. Unhook my tv then hook up my internet, with a broken spine and nerve damage. If that is not worth a credit of some type I do not know what is. I have tried to talk with corporate in Philadelphia but you can not get anywhere. Forget Florida Corporate they are even worst. Join our voice, in numbers we have power.

"Tom of Hypoluxo, FL",41703,1,"I am a snowbird. I called on Monday, March 3, to report that the cable box doesn't respond and that I would like a service technician to come and replace it. I was informed a technician would come between 1-3pm on Tuesday, March 4. At 4pm that day, I called so many times I can't remember, and was told that I was mistaken about the appointment time. It was rescheduled for Wednesday, March 5 between 1-3pm. I decided to drive to the Lake Worth location and replace the box myself. They were very nice at that location. I replaced the box myself, called the number provided, 1-855-OK-BEGIN. Went through an automated sequence, but the cable box didn't respond. But, at least the BYPASS light was illuminated (the box I returned was totally dead). I was told it would take 45 minutes (by the automation) for the system to load the information. I was also told that my service call was open and that the expected time of arrival by the technician is between 2:50-3:10PM. Needless to say, as I type this the time is 5:18pm and no call, no service technician, NOTHING. While I waited, I logged on to Comcast.com to try and get resolution from there... nothing again. I have called about 4x. I have been asked the same questions over and over again with the same results: NOTHING. I requested for a supervisor to call, put on hold and then disconnected. This happened 2x. Right now I got hold of yet another person and was told a supervisor will call me back. THIS IS DISGRACEFUL SERVICE. How can we have this kind of service (or lack thereof) in this country? You would expect it from a 3rd world country? What is the problem???? I am so upset right now. I will report another complaint/update if there is one. I am exhausted right now. This is supposed to be my vacation and I've wasted two days out of my week!"
"Heidar of White Hall, MD","Feb. 19, 2014",1,"I replaced my Comcast modem with one I purchased from Best Buy over a year ago. When I installed mine, they had me call in to give them the model number, etc. They also said I had to return the Comcast modem to a service center which I did. About six months later I noticed the rental charge still on my bill so I called in to get it taken off. The guy I spoke with was very nice and said they would investigate and call me back within two to three days. No call back and I forgot about it until now and see they are still charging me for a rental. So called again and now they want me to go back to the service center with the receipt for the modem I purchased over a year ago! They will then ""investigate"" and remove charges. Really... I've been a customer of Comcast since 1998 and have had issues with them before but now they are telling me they don't care anymore. Just the aggravation of having to drive there again, wait in line and prove to them that I bought the modem. I asked the Comcast rep if there was someone I could speak with that could resolve this issue and she said no, I had to go to the center. I think Comcast has lost the idea that customers are number one and they've gotten too big to handle stuff like this. It's very disappointing but DirecTV, here I come."
"Mark R. of Broomfield, CO","Feb. 5, 2014",1,"I called Comcast on December 15th to let them know that we were moving and to shut off our service on December 23rd. As usual the Comcast customer service agent that I talked to was not American and their command of the English language was not perfect. A couple of weeks later after moving I took their cable TV boxes back. Then I get a bill in the mail for service owing for January and more for February. So I call them back and I get the gal from India (or wherever) again, who tells me that they thought that I was moving my service to a new address. After going round and round with her, she had me wait on-hold for at least 20 minutes until a bona-fide American ""account executive"" could get on the line, who told me that I had never made a shut-off request, even though their non-native customer service agent had just told me that my shut-off request had been misinterpreted by them. So they refused to give me any credit for telling them to turn my service off until after the date that I turned their equipment back into them, claiming that I never told them to shut off my service. What obviously happened was that their foreign-based customer service worker misunderstood me, and Comcast's official response is that I should have called back to make sure that my first call was received accurately. So just so that we all know, either make at least a couple of follow-up calls to Comcast just to make sure your first calls weren't misunderstood by their second-rate foreign customer service workers or be ready to pay Comcast for extra service costs. Thanks but no thanks, Comcast. I won't be needing that run around ever again."
"Tracy of Peoria, IL","Feb. 2, 2014",1,"Our power company sent a letter saying that our cable running into the house from Comcast which we now only use for internet was too close to the power line running into the house and was in violation of the electrical codes. I called Comcast and they said they would take care of it. When they never came out, I called back and the ticket was closed. I had it reopened and they said they would take care of it this time. Nothing happened and I called and the ticket had been closed again. This has now happened 3 times and nothing has been done. The internet service is already really slow and the fact that they have such awful customer service makes me glad we are moving soon and there will be more options for internet. I told Comcast that if the power company threatens to turn off our power because of the location of the cable that I would cut it and remove it completely and find internet elsewhere. I still haven't seen any sign that they are going to do anything about this. When I lived in Indianapolis I had no problems with Comcast, but my experience is that they are awful in Illinois."
"Dabareh of Silver City, NM","Jan. 27, 2014",1,"I got new Internet only service when I moved a month ago. They gave me a $39.95 ""deal,"" but my bills will be close to $60 a month after all the added charges. No satisfaction at all with queries. Initially, my modem would not work (I was supposed to self-install). I spent two hours on the phone troubleshooting, turning it on and off, etc. They told me that the modem was receiving fine according to their system. Finally got a guy out 4 days later. The wiring out the side of the house was simply waving in the air - not connected to anything. Receiving, my eye.Then, the past week, I have sat HOURS waiting for pages to load. Internet speed goes from 0 up to .5 mbps, peaks at 5mbps, and then back to 0. I have unplugged and reset the modem a number of times. No help. I make my living on the computer and am extremely upset that I couldn't get work completed. I cannot find any way to report a problem online. I type ""Report a Problem"" in the search box and it reverts to the default page. The Silver City phone number in the phone directory and online is a disconnected number. Is there no recourse for bad service?"
"kim of Villa Rica, GA","Jan. 24, 2014",1,"When I moved I called to have Comcast installed because like everyone else I saw their ads and thought I would be getting good service. Boy was I ever wrong. When I called I stated I wanted the DVR in one room and standard in four other rooms. Was told okay and they would be out in a few days to do it. The day of installation arrives and the installer hooks up my DVR in the living room and then he hooks up the internet in my master and he's ready to leave. Hold up I say what about my other rooms. His reply was: ""That wasn't on my work order, I have to call it in."" After walking around my house he tells me he can't install cable in my bedrooms because the wires were installed wrong and I would have to have wall facing because the wires come in through the attic. I asked could he do it and he said no, Comcast didn't do it anymore. I would have to hire an electrician to install them. I asked, ""Can't you drill a hole in from the outside and do it,"" he said no. I asked since it was installed wrong couldn't we just start over. I just bought the house but I'm assuming Comcast is the one who installed the wires since its their box on the side of the house. He said no because it was already installed I had to have an electrician come out and fix it. I asked him many times could we do it this way or that way and every time was ""No, Comcast doesn't do that."" So I get on the phone to Comcast. After being hung up on 9 times, I finally get to speak with someone. I explained I want to cancel my service because I can't get cable in my bedrooms. I spoke with Juan and he told me Comcast does do wall facing but there is a charge. I had to pay $60 for the guy to come back out plus $30 for wall facing per room and $35 for something else. It was going to cost around 200 dollars. I said no cancel my service. Juan said, ""Wait, I'm going to get this straightened out because the installer could have installed it differently."" He said, ""I'm putting this in the computer, call back tomorrow,"" and they would get someone else out here to install it. So I call back today and spoke with the rudest person ever. I'm told they had to install the wall facing because I live in an apartment. What I explained to Juan yesterday that I live in a one story house that I own and yes we could drill a hole in the wall or the floor or anything that needed to be done. After I told her that she hung up on me. So I call back and tell them I want to cancel my service and the lady I spoke with tries to get me to change my mind. I said nope cancel my service. I may have kept trying had the internet worked the way it was supposed to. Only my laptop connects with the internet. My son's Xbox won't connect nor with my tablet. Done with Comcast for good. This was their second chance with me. Canceled years ago because they keep going up on my bill."
"Yuri of Atlanta, GA","Jan. 23, 2014",1,"In the beginning of this year I decided to leave greedy AT&T DSL and switch to Comcast cable Internet. I donŠ—Èt subscribe to the land line or TV so Internet is all I need. I switched on Jan 5, attached wireless router to my own cable modem, Comcast tech connected the modem and everything was ok - until Monday Jan 20. After 5pm on that day, my whole family started complaining about outages that would occur 3-4 times an hour and last anywhere from 2 to 10 min. I did quick troubleshooting and realized that cable modem loses the signal then regains it. Naturally, I decide to contact Comcast tech support, without knowing yet that what will happen next will be beyond Good and Evil Š—– just incredible.So my first contact is made via Comcast chat, in between two outages. At this point chat was broken by yet another outage. So, I immediately drive to the store and fork out $75 for DOCSIS 3 model from Zoom Telephonics. I install it, my computer asked me to run Comcast registration for the new device and everything connects. I live happily for another 30 min. Then, as you guessed already, another outage occurs and 15 min later Š—– another one.I go into chat again and request reimbursement. Agent asks if I have a proof that such reimbursement was indeed promised to me, to which I reply that I saved the entire conversation to PDF file. Agent then files a case and tells me that I will be contacted within 2-3 days (which didn't happen yet but it may happen later). Ok, done with financial matters, now onto the technical issue. This time, I decided to use the phone because outages wouldn't let me finish chats. I am transferred to someone with heavy Indian accent.It is about 11.30 pm, I have no Internet and I understand that I am dealing with lousiest tech support in the world that has no competence, training or just a common sense. I switch us back to the old modem for now. I am about to give up and switch to AT&T first thing in the morning, but my wife, equally enraged, wants to press on. So she dials the support number.At this point I raised my hand to smash the phone into the wall, but instead, I just hang up. Next, I continued troubleshooting and after a couple of modem and router reboots I got us back online albeit with outages. Computer, of course, had nothing to do with it and couldn't have, even in theory. The last conversation also got me wondering if these support guys in India actually wear two hats, one for support and another for sales? In any case, if previous agents were just incompetent, this guy truly deserved the title of King of Morons.The next day, I decided to give it the last try before going back to AT&T and connected to a chat from work (internet at home was unusable) . Surprisingly, this chat agent, after checking my case notes on file and reading my messages, said that she is going to dispatch a technician to my house because it is obvious to her that the modem, or router or computer had nothing to do with the issue I was having. She scheduled the appointment for me. Out of curiosity, I asked which modem is currently registered with Comcast. She replied Š—“Your Zoom modem is registered as your own and connected to Comcast.Š— Then I asked her how come that agent from yesterday demanded that I register my modem by the phone call and guys in activation department tried to do it and failed, and then they tried convince me that it is their own modem and if not, I have to go to the local office to resolve the issue? She replied that unfortunately, she has no clue why previous two agents were giving me wrong directions and wrong info.So the tech appt is scheduled for the end of this week and guess what? My internet is up without a glitch for the last 24 hours on my new modem. So, my ordeal is over, hopefully. I can say to the world that of these 6 agents I worked with, only one from billing dept and last one in tech support were good. The rest four can be classified as incompetent and unprofessional idiots, liars, and a mix of type 1 and 2. Now tell me: if you were in my shoes, will you ever subscribe to any Comcast service? Would you be willing to talk to all of these who are unable to troubleshoot, but quickly blame customer equipment or provide false information and try to sell you more services instead of fixing broken one? I want to make sure that this story is available to as many people as possible. This may compensate me for wasted time, money and my blood pressure that shot up after communicating with this great Comcast support that is Š—“always here for you, 24-7Š—."
"Lee of Antelope, CA","Jan. 20, 2014",1,"I specifically asked the internet sales representative if the charges for service were a flat rate which would not increase drastically like most contract deals, and was assured it would stay the same... Four months later it has increased 40%... I consider the sales tactics of Comcast to be deceptive at best and outright fraud at worst. I am sure they spend more on advertising than customer service and don't give a rat's ** about their customers... SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND GET A DIFFERENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Richard of Tucson, AZ","Jan. 20, 2014",2,"I have been a customer of Comcast Business Class for about 10 years. Currently I pay $125/month for service with static IP addresses. I have been extremely happy with the service up until about October 2013. The service became very slow from 20Mb/s down to 1Mb/s (upload was 5Mb/s to 0.2Mb/s). I am constantly resetting their cable modem to get a temporary fix. Comcast replaced the modem but the condition still persists. A call today to Comcast resulted in a sales pitch. They suggested that for another $15/month I could get 50Mb/s download and 10Mb/s upload. I just want what I used to get. It appears that they have oversold bandwidth and are rationing services, or they are purposely causing the problem in order to sell customers into higher priced plans."
"larry of Alpharetta, GA","Jan. 15, 2014",1,"My complaint call started on Jan 8 due to internet service so slow (3-9 versus 50mbps) during the holiday weeks. They took 4 days to fix the problem; however, on Monday Jan 13 the problem is back. In the meantime, they refused to give the BLAST expensive service credit for the month of December and now spilling into Jan."
"loc of Alpharetta, GA","Jan. 13, 2014",1,"During the month of December, my BLAST internet service was reduced down to dismal performance metrics e.g., 3 to 9mbps according to your speed test. Initially I thought it was due to the holiday season with lots of internet access from people for holiday activities. Finally the service became unbearable, I called on Jan 8 for service. It took Comcast 4 days to determine that the speed issue was from the outside according to your techs. I called billing dept for a credit and the standard answer I received was ""According to our policy we can only credit you since Jan 8 when you called in."" It's unacceptable to me since the problem had been there before and the service was not up to par as I paid. If Comcast refused to own up its issue and acts responsibly to its customer like me. I don't need your token credit from Jan 8 to Jan 12. Otherwise, do the right thing, give me the credit for the low standard internet service I received throughout the month of December."
"A of Northampton, MA","Dec. 16, 2013",1,"I don't own a TV. Comcast provides me with internet. They've charged me $50 to fix a problem that was their fault. They have sent me adapters, remotes, a new router without me ordering them!! Then in the tiniest writing possible, somewhere under a flap of the box it says, ""If you don't return this product in 5 days, we will begin to start charging you $ for our products"". That's such crap!! I have to take time out of my day to go to the post office or find a UPS store, find parking, wait in line, then drop off a product that I can't even USE and did not order otherwise I will be charged?! This should be illegal! I'm canceling the service."
"Lynn of Dearborn, MI","Dec. 9, 2013",1,"I was texted by AT&T telling me my data for the month on my Apple cell was used up, due to my carrier Comcast. When I contacted them they told me because I had an Apple cell that was the problem and if I wanted the Wi-Fi working I needed a ""special code"" for $79.00. I finally cancelled Comcast and now fighting the early cancellation fee of &300.00."
"Della of Memphis, TN","Dec. 9, 2013",2,"Comcast Internet service suddenly got slow last month. It was perfectly fine until then, and I had no complaints. Now, even photos can take time to download and I have to wait several minutes to watch certain videos. We called customer care and their resolution is for us to pay more money for faster service, plus $250 to install new equipment to accommodate said faster service. Our current bill of $86 will increase to $114."
"Vincent of Adamstown, MD","Dec. 3, 2013",1,"I have been having an issue with Comcast since Aug 5 and still at the same place today (Dec 3) as when I first started complaining. It started when I was working from home on a Monday and took a break and stepped outside when I saw my neighbor. While we were talking she received a call from her daughter and she went inside. Moments later we both walked outside because my internet and her phone both were shut off. From that day on I have been getting slower than dial up service paying for Blast (50 mbps). I have called a number of times always to get the same the thing it's your equipment, it's your router, it's computer. Well, after spending $2,000 on a new router, computer, and tablet we are still experiencing the same problem before spending any money. I have seen seven different techs (all same something different as to why my internet service is acting the way it is) that I have had to take off work, reschedule my day, and I am fed up with wasting my time. It has been 4 months and I need help getting Comcast to realize it might be their messed up equipment. This is a new housing development. With Comcast having the monopoly in the area it is hard to get what some would say an end to the madness."
"Susan of Saint Paul, MN","Nov. 20, 2013",1,"The ""Borg"" as we like to call them. After 8 years of paying them well over $200 a month for mediocre at best service, I moved to an area where (thankfully) Comcast does not rule. I called them to shut off service and we discussed that I would gladly return six pieces of equipment. Each piece was verified on the phone and the address to where I could bring the items. I am disabled so this meant I needed to enlist someone to take me to their main Borg ship on Plato Blvd. in Saint Paul (as instructed). How surprised I was to find that they no longer occupied that building. Myself and several other confused people were instructed to drop our equipment in the drop box. I was rather concerned but the person in line with me worked for Comcast and advised that they ""just junk it all"" anyway. So, several days later I received an $800+ bill, which I had to call, sit on hold and wait to find out it was equipment charges as they never itemize ""new charges"". They advised me that they would update the bill and send a new bill just as soon as the equipment was logged as returned. 2 weeks later I get a bill that has the amount I owe $82.30 and some $ 25.00 mystery ""new charge"". I called and of course had no time to hold to find out what this was all about. Within 2 days of my receiving the bill, I get a collections call from Diversified collections, demanding $82.30??? Huh? So I call Comcast once again, to ask why I was turned over to collections two days after I receive my final bill and what the 25.00 is for? They advised me it was because of an un-returned router! Wrong! I work in telecommunications and I know that if they were charging me over $800 in equipment, the router would have been the most expensive part of that equation. So either they are lying about the charge, lying about the real cost of the equipment and its value or just trying to squeeze more money out of me. Once again I had to reiterate the entire story of having to go to drop off equipment (with witnesses) and that I was not buying their story. I paid what was due and not a penny more. I am still receiving collection calls for the $82.30 and am now going to file a complaint, for all it will do with the millions of others to the BBB. Please!! If you live south of the twin cities do not let this monster in this territory! We have Mediacom, very similar but much smaller so easier to work with and no problems."
"James of Louisville, CO","Nov. 3, 2013",1,"I switched to Comcast high speed internet and cable TV because my kids wanted to watch some sports on TV. I was pretty happy with Century Link DSL, but since I was getting TV and all the Comcast ads say they are the fastest I bundled internet with cable. There really are no words to express how upset I am with the experience. My 30 day cancellation period ends in a couple days and I am GONE!First, despite every ad on TV saying service is their top priority, their service is **. Techs are nice, but it's a scam. I've had techs to my house twice and it still isn't right. Then my network printer didn't work and I called in immediately and on about the 3rd call, having waited a total of 2hrs, no kidding, they told me it was my problem and would cost to get it working again. I said, ""it was working immediately before I switched and is not now, so this is your problem."" Long story short I finally sucked it up and went to Signature Support (i.e. paid support) and they told me it would cost $14.95 to get it working. I said, ""what the hell"" and OK-ed it. Then after changing some settings it worked again. I sensed that I'd been set up on something, so asked and the rep said I had signed up for the $14.95 recurring service plan. I had him transfer me over to cancel that immediately and did. Then looked at my bill and not only was I still on the $14.95 plan they had charged me $50 for the call. I was pissed but figured I could get that off the bill by threatening to cancel. Then my son mentioned that he thought the Comcast wireless was slow compared to Century Link. He watches a lot of MLB videos and they were all breaking up. Then I started noticing that streaming videos and movies were not playing as smoothly as before on CL and downloads were just taking longer.So we were getting pretty dissatisfied with the internet (and the cable was causing us a huge number of frustrations and pissing us off daily, i.e. the new X1 box was going from color to black and white every 2 minutes, requiring box reboot, horrible search menus, just a ** system). After my 7th call to customer service, with about 5 hrs on hold and being pissed off once again I decided to go back to Century Link. So back up and running on CL DSL and Comcast internet still running. I had bookmarked an internet speed test link I saw on the Comcast site and ran a comparison while both are still connected. The Comcast test said I was getting 28 mbps +/- and when I ran it on CL it averaged around 12 mbps. I think that is the biggest scam of them all. But, we all noticed that the CL DSL seemed incredibly fast compared to Comcast. I mean lightning fast. Click, load, it's there. Clean, smooth video playback. It was a palpable improvement over Comcast.But here was this Comcast sourced speed test telling me it was half the speed. I think this speed test, in fact all their talk about the fastest internet, is just one big BS scam, just like everything I've experienced with the company so far. Every time I turn on the TV I see a couple ads an hour BSing about their service and ""fastest internet, no one can match..."" Crap! Customer service their top priority? BS. Fastest high speed internet? BS! I would seriously distrust anything you hear from the company. I will never go back."
"Ron of Spokane, WA","Oct. 23, 2013",1,"I appreciate your experience and has me rethinking going to Comcrap internet only as DSL with its ""7mg"" is just too slow with the addition of more and more wireless devices. Comcrap has our city tied into them as City administrators won't even talk about allowing competition into our area. My past experience with their Customer NO Service has been that they will tell me anything and deliver nothing. We dropped them (TV) years ago and went over the air with streaming Netflix and have been very happy - not missing Comcrap at all. My cost? After purchasing the necessary antenna and misc. stuff, $8.69 month - for Netflix. The over the air signal is MORE clear than Comcrap ever was (and slightly better than Dish was) and it's FREE! I just asked my neighbor, a ""loyal"" Comcrap customer, how often his bill is increased and his reply was ""every month""??? Yes, they get a ""couple dollar"" increase EVERY MONTH! I talked myself out of going back to Comcrap. If ever there was a company that doesn't deserve our business, itŠ—Ès Comcast aka COMCRAP.Why did I leave them? Because they mailed me a flyer for a service that seemed too good to be true. I called the customer no service number on the flyer and explained my understanding of the flyer and asked if that was correct. ""YES"" was the answer. Rather than ordering it from them at the time, I was still skeptical so went to a kiosk at a local mall and discussed the service offering and questioned the guy extensively who assured me that my understanding was correct. I signed up with him, he gave me whatever the device was that was required and off I went. When my next bill came, it was significantly higher than what I had understood and what 2 of Comcrap's people assured me was true. I was so pissed that I canceled my service vowing never to go back."
"Hope of Twin Lake, MI","Oct. 22, 2013",1,"I'm convinced Comcast is throttling my internet signal. We've had issues with connectivity for 4 months now. Nearly every night between 8:30 and 10:30 our speeds slow down to a crawl. During that time it's so bad that we can't even load any websites at all. There have been three tech visits. The first tech said the signal was too strong. He installed a splitter behind the modem. The problem continued. The second tech did absolutely nothing.The third tech was here for over two hours. He connected his laptop to our modem and using some kind of diagnostic program, he monitored the signal for about an hour and a half. He could clearly see there was an issue with the signal, lots of spikes where there should have been none, but he couldn't fix the issue and would escalate it to the next tier.Two weeks later our problems still continued and I hadn't heard one word from Comcast. So, I called again, explained the situation all over again for about the 5th time and they once again set up an appointment for a tech to come out. The day the tech was supposed to come (Oct. 2nd) I received a call from him that afternoon. It was the same tech who had been here for two hours a couple weeks earlier. He said they had received a complaint from another customer who is in our 'node' who has been having the same issues with their internet signal. He also said he had continued to monitor our situation and continued to see the problems with the signal.He asked if it would be okay for another tech to come later in the evening, hopefully during the time frame when we have the problem (8:30-10:30) so that tech could see it for himself. I agreed. Within a half hour after agreeing to the later appointment, the tech who was supposed to come that evening called and said they now had two other customers within our 'node' who are having the same issues. He wasn't going to come to the house after-all. Instead, he and the other tech were going to be monitoring the signal and he asked me to call him if/when the problem occurs so they would be able to pin-point it.At some point that evening the internet stopped working. I called the number given to me by the tech and told him it was happening right at that moment. That was Oct. 2nd and I never heard another word from Comcast. Our problems persisted. Last week I received a letter in the mail asking if I was satisfied with the work completed on October 6th. First of all, I have no knowledge of any work done on October 6th and second of all, our internet continues to be unusable nearly every evening between 8:30 - 10:30... sometimes earlier... sometimes later. I called the phone number that was provided with the letter. The person I reached on the other end had no idea what I was talking about... no record whatsoever of this nightmare we have been going through with this God-awful company! She promised to escalate our problem. Oh gee...thanks.Tonight I received a call from some other tech who had no idea at all what has been going on these last four months. I'm afraid I lost it when he asked me to describe the problems we've been having. If there were any other internet service providers in my area I would drop Comcast in a second. But unfortunately, they're the only game in town. What on earth does one have to do to get this company to fix my service so that I can actually use what I'm paying my hard-earned money for? I am at my wit's end!"
"Raymond of Memphis, TN","Oct. 16, 2013",1,"I was so dissatisfied with my bill, I contacted customer services. I was cut off several times and when I provided my phone number for a ""call back"", once I answered the phone, another cutoff. After over an hour trying to reach them, I finally got a voice. The person told me they would refer me to Customer Resolution. After I spoke with a guy for less than 2 minutes, he claimed that my telephone number wasn't on file. He then asked for my address and when I provided it to him, he hang up. This was a nightmare of over 2 hours. The next day I went to the COMCAST office, and they told me my problem couldn't be resolved there and only recited my bill again to me. I had enough of their lying and terrible customer services. I am going to cancel COMCAST and end this nightmare with them."
"Alex of Jacksonville, FL","Oct. 16, 2013",1,"We schedule service calls for our clients for Comcast to come out and do it right. No big deal, they would normally have something available the next day or so, at least that's what you've been told. When that appointment comes, no one shows up or calls. So we call them. They sometimes claim that they have no record of us setting an appointment. We would schedule it again the next day between 8-12. They don't show up until 6 pm without even calling. There were other jobs we had where we told them to call us prior to arrival because we can't afford waiting there all day. They showed up twice and left without calling us. We were 10 min away. From now on, I will let all our customers know the truth about Comcast."
"Priscilla of Punta Gorda, FL","Oct. 15, 2013",1,"Yesterday I was to receive a call from a Comcast service technician that was to walk me through the step so that I may replace the ""lost/dropped"" emails in my Comcast.net account. That did not happen. This morning I rec'd a call from Comcast, Jacksonville, FL stating they were just placing a follow up call. I stated ""Follow Up"" from what, no one called. One of the previous service calls had me change my passwords so they could work on the system. They provided me with a new password and locked me out of my old password. I was to wait 24 hours and a technician would walk me through what I needed to do on my side. She stated that none of those directions were applicable... REALLY. She stated that there is no clear way for Comcast to say they could retrieve the emails they lost/dropped in September. Does anyone know any more about the process of recovery, why or what I need to do and WILL I get back my emails? NO real service, fix to problem since Sept 21. HELP."

I was informed that I would have my email in my account/resolved in 72 hours... ItŠ—Ès six days later from my last service call. No historical records recovered. Today, they have changed my password. Now I have to wait for a technician to call me back. They provided no further directions, no explanation, no confidence that my communication records are safe, secure and will be returned.

"Patrick  of Colorado Springs, CO","Oct. 14, 2013",1,"My 84 year old mother was not able to access her Comcast email. She called Comcast support, was transferred to tech support, which actually was E-fix (a company in Salt Lake City). They gained remote access to her laptop and said it was all screwed up and would fix it for $200. My mother objected over the price and was told they would give her a senior discount ($135). She agreed then they uploaded anti-spyware and ran a 2 hr. upload and full scan. They called back, said laptop was fixed of all problems. The email still didn't work. Her account was charged $165. Myself, her son, has attempted numerous times to contact Comcast to resolve this to no avail.Many of the Comcast agents are unaware of this outsourcing and some think we were scammed by somebody outside their system. I have talked and chatted to many of their people who have escalated the problem but have not received one call back or email. In my mind Comcast is throwing people with problems to the vultures."

One yell at us. One cut the cable. One cut the phone line. Two months later, our internet is still cut in and out, or no internet all together. Oct. 1, 2013, we transfer our internet from Comcast to Century Link. Century Link is only 12 MGB compare to 50 MGB Comcast advertised. We were wondering how slow our internet would be with Century Link. When we switch over from Comcast modem to Century Link, we are pleasantly surprised. The webs come right up. My internet game run a whole lot faster too. Today, we call Comcast to disconnect our service. I mention this to the customer service. She turns very hostile. I almost regret that we mentioned it, but someone should know. I hope our experience would help someone else choosing internet. Thanks for reading."
"Ura of New York City, NY","Sept. 27, 2013",1,"Attempted to transfer service from my old address to my new address. I was quoted a price on the phone, wrote the price down, and agreed to the price. Based on the quote, I passed up opportunities for discounted service for satellite service, offered to people moving. First bill comes, and the price is higher than my previous bill (for the same service), and significantly higher than the quoted price. Comcast denies their original price, continually states that their stated price was ""not something they offer"", and says they will need to review the previous call recording and contact me. They fail to do so, and upon contacting them, they will not address the previous call recording, although I suspected it had been reviewed. After multiple calls and several hours I offer to mail their legal department my copy of the original call - which they stated they were recording - and which my cell phone had recorded as well. Suddenly I get something slightly better than the original quoted price and phone service added. Comcast had already confirmed multiple times that there was no way for me to get this offer. I know they sometimes offer a discounted ""triple-play"" price that is less than internet + TV combined - there was no confusion, this offer only came AFTER I stated I had a recording of the original call.In the vast majority of my calls, I was abruptly dumped to collections by employees who did not even collect basic information. Why? The installer hadn't filed the correct paperwork when returning equipment he had collected during installation. I had no idea my account showed a $600+ charge for the equipment, I was just treated like a deadbeat. I only realized THEIR mistake when my second bill arrived, and the equipment charge was listed. I had to wait for that charge to be removed from my account before anyone would even discuss their other mistake in our agreed upon price.Why am I writing this today? Because my service today is intermittently failing. I work for a big networking gear company. Their modem is broken. I know tier 1 support doesn't know that, so I followed their directions politely. I patiently spent time on the phone, again, and now I get to wait two days for a service call. They did ask me to call them back to reduce my bill once the service is corrected. I have no idea why that can't be done without me calling, yet again. They need ME to tell THEM when the service is restored? And not charging for something they're failing to deliver is really the law, not customer service. I wasn't given the option to switch the service to another time. Why would they even worry about whether Sunday was a good day for me? They've already treated me like a deadbeat and a liar, without apology, when the errors have all clearly been on their side."
"Linda of Denville, NJ","Sept. 25, 2013",1,"Received a letter they are increasing my internet stating they have not charged me correctly for Equipment. The only equipment I am aware of for the internet is the modem and I Own that. Spoke to two different people who told me they cannot give me the information and both of these people gave me two different reasons why they could not give me the information. My name is not on the account so I get the information the first person told me I need. And when I called back the other tells me they don't care if I have that information they need to speak to the person whose name is on the account. Funny, I pay the bills and they do not seem to have a problem with that. I certainly agree with protecting the customers information, though I am not looking for any information regarding the customer. This is a Simple Question as to why they are increasing the rate and seems like they are making every excuse possible to avoid this question. I also have a very strong feeling they are trying to bill me for something I do not have. To me this is just Dirty Crooked Business."
"Jay of Miami, FL","Sept. 24, 2013",1,"Since September 4th, 2013 I have tried and tried to get Comcast to fix my internet and TV service. I have spent countless hours on hold and talking with clerks who have no authority, training or control of the situation. Theirs is a system without accountability or internal controls and the result is a system wildly out of control and completely unresponsive to the customer. Missed appointments (4), no call backs as promised (several), wrong information (countless), hours and hours on hold. I have never been this angry and frustrated with a company. It has been absolutely unbelievable."
"Brenda of Elk Grove, CA","Sept. 19, 2013",4,"Well I am a happy camper. I got a hold of someone who went above and beyond and resolved the problem with our phone. We got our old number back and was compensated for the inconvenience. I spoke with Mike yesterday and he told me it could take up to a week. However this evening he called us and it was fixed. He took it personal that Comcast made the error and hadn't corrected it. I did contact the FCC and file and complaint along with our local media watchdog, but will let them know it has been resolved. He also told me if we have any more problems to contact him directly immediately."
"C. of Chicago, IL","Sept. 18, 2013",1,"In May of 2012, I had Comcast install a home security system. It never worked as promised. The camera kept dropping off and this system had many false alarms. I had Comcast out to my home over 20 times within the first 90 days after installation. This was extremely frustrating since I had to continue to take time off work to meet the technician. I kept paying monthly for the system and soon got fed up with paying for something that wasn't working. So I cancelled the service in May 2013 and got hit with an $800 cancellation fee.After talking with many representatives I get the same answer. I finally got to the corporate office and they also refused to waive the fee. This company is as crooked as can be so I cancelled my service and got a new service and I am much happier with my new service. For all you folks out there, don't settle for poor service. Dump them and move on."
"Brenda of Elk Grove, CA","Sept. 16, 2013",1,"On 9/1/13, I was waiting for a phone call from our daughter who was traveling to see us. Our phone never rang; however it showed a voice mail on the caller ID. She told us that it went directly to voice mail, so I tried calling customer service and the wait time on their automated system said approx. 15 minute wait time, so I hung up because I was having family come over and figured they were having issues. I checked our phone later that night and it rang at our house, so I thought the problem had been solved. On 9/2/13, the same thing happened and this time I contacted Customer Service and was told our phone number had been changed (without our consent) and they may have re-issued our number out. After being on hold for over 50 minutes, they corrected it and told me I would have to call back the next day to get it permanently corrected. So I did, they were supposed to call me back to confirm that it was done; however I never received a call back, but the phone was correct (THAT is until 9/11/13). I was on a phone call and it automatically disconnected our call and I had no dial tone to call out. I had to make 3 calls (being disconnected after 15 minutes on hold, talking to another customer service rep and then demanding to speak with his supervisor). Their response was we called in June and they miscoded something which caused this error and they have already re-issued our number out and cannot get it back, but they would try to contact the new customer. I went 5 days without any phone service because someone in their company put the ""new phone number"" they assigned to us on a different port and we had to have a tech come out to the house to find this out. I have been on the phone with them (supervisor and IT supervisor) trying to get this resolved. They said they couldn't just go and take the number back; however that is exactly what they did to me!!!!!! I want my old number back since I have had it for over 4 years and it was not my error in the first place... I told the supervisor that I would call the new people every 15 minutes 24 hours a day until they turned it back in if they refuse to give my number back. It isn't their fault, but it is not mine either and I shouldn't have to make changes for an error they did."
"Gordon of Somerset, NJ","Sept. 14, 2013",1,"About 8 channels on my conventional TV (both HD & SD) went blank (black screen). After usual runaround, a technician visits. He fiddled around and left. Next visit on 9/9/13 resulted in swapping cable box, wires, splitter to phone Inet, etc. Assured ""problem was outside on pole"" and left. NO change in TV behavior. Next visit, 9/12/13. Tech REPEATED all previous steps! Changed cable box, added a new piece of hardware (don't know WHAT it is or for). He also had his eye on my internet/phone service, but I would not let him touch it!He was here 4 hours! (He was very hard to understand verbally). Departed. Result - can't turn TV on or off, can't control volume, DVD player inactive (cannot access start or play). 9/13/13 21:00 hrs first call to Comcast. Assured by person just a matter of remote programming. ""He had a little difficulty in getting codes"". Would call me back by 22:00 hrs to reprogram remote. Of course, never did. 22:00 approx. 2nd call .Young lady tried best to help. Tried reprogramming remote (she had no trouble getting codes!). No go. NEXT appointment ,9/16/13 09:00 hrs. These are just highlights. Tech #3, during his 4-hour visit, even had to borrow tools from me! Comcast support is a disgrace."
"Cindy of Thornton, CO","Sept. 11, 2013",4,"Customer service has always been exceptional. Downtime is minimal (we use the bundled services) - tell me about any company with no downtime - you can't. If it impacts my business for an extended period, they have given refunds. The only thing I don't like is the price. If any other company could equal their product and service, I'd move. Huge kudos to the techs who have come to help with installations and complicated WiFi issues. Every time they've been here, they could be textbook examples of great customer service."
"deborah of Fort Wayne, IN","Sept. 10, 2013",2,"I responded to an offer for a FREE Gateway router/modem from Comcast. It said faster internet speed. It was much slower than my old one, which I had to return to them. I called them 3 times and was finally told I could get faster speed by PAYING for a higher ""tier"". I feel this is bait and switch."
"Fawzia of Albuquerque, NM","Sept. 9, 2013",1,They sign you up for one thing and they charge you for higher price. You never get the speed they promise. Their customer and internet service sucks!!!!!!!!
"daidra of Pittsburgh, PA","Sept. 9, 2013",2,"Transferred service twice. Lied to when asked if I would be charged any fees. 1st time service installed, phone never worked and was charged installation fees all over again. Second transfer, I made sure to make it a self install. Account was noted and I still was charged all over again. Called for refund, had to argue for an hour to get full credit or let them know I would be canceling service. Added additional line and tech did such a poor job it knocked the phone off and all the other boxes off. We had to uninstall what he attempted to do and reroute the lines. Boxes constantly need reset. Volume on boxes do not work all the time either. DVR constantly goes off line. Called this evening to reset a box. After 1st attempt, tech was to call back to see if problem was resolved and never called back. Had to make another call again, switched boxes and found the box was not broke, so the connection is not properly done. After a very long time and much frustration, I was told it was my fault the lines are not working properly even though all lines were cleared on Aug 17 and fully functional until second repairman came and did a hack job installing another room. I was asked to pay more money and be responsible for more charges if they need to fix the problem. How am I responsible if it was done right the first time? It hasn't even been thirty days. I'm very disappointed in the quality of Comcast customer service and craftsmanship of Comcast equipment. I'm paying for service and can barely watch it without calling in first."
"Mike of Highlands Ranch, CO","Sept. 4, 2013",1,"Yesterday (Tues, Sept 3, 2013), I spent 3 hours (3pm-6pm) trying to get effective service from Comcast regarding their Internet ""service."" I had to call back several times due to disconnects, rude incompetent service, reps refusal to listen (constantly interrupting), having to jump through the same grueling hoops over and over and over and over, reps transferring me to voicemail hell where I heard incredibly painful hi-volume ""music"" on hold for up to 35 minutes, hang-ups, etc. I went through this same ordeal about a month ago without a solution to my Internet service problem - AGAIN! I put off calling again because I HATE their ""service"" that wastes many hours of my time.(In fact, last time, the technician's phone was breaking up so badly) I couldn't understand him. He said, ""Here's my personal number so you can call me back."" When I called back, I got the same ** entry point as if I had never talked to anyone at all. I've been a Comcast customer, paying thousand$ of dollar$ for over 2 years (phone, TV, Internet). Regarding the Internet, everything was fine until they sent me a new modem, which I installed according to the directions supplied... yes, I can surf the Internet, BUT... Now, I can no longer hook up my wireless printer with my laptop and iPad (which worked before). Now, I can neither FTP-update my websites nor my client's websites (which worked before) due to some sort-of ""port problem"" according to analysts at Blue Host. Now, I cannot access my Comcast Internet Admin account. (Can you say, ""Out of business?"") Of course, Comcast's attitude seems to be it's MY fault: The customer is always wrong!"
"MARGARITA of Miami, FL","Sept. 4, 2013",1,"I am currently being sued by Comcast without a reason. I am actually in collection but my account is up to date and my balance is at 0. When I moved to my new rental I made the transfer effective March 1 and I moved and did not get my service installed until March 10 and it took the guy 15 minutes to install the service. No one bothered to let me know that my account number was changed and so was my phone number. I found out because my family was calling and getting a disconnect recording. When I tried calling them back from my house number, that is when I found out I had a new number. Hmm, all this time I took it and was glad to get my service. I did write a nasty letter to the CEO, who doesn't really care and got a phone call from some woman at his office offering apologies for all my struggles and my bill was going to be reduced due to a misunderstanding of some wall outlets that I was charged for but didn't need and never got. Long story short, I am now being sued by Comcast for an account cancellation that occurred in May 2013 according to the collection agency. However, the account number does not match my old account or my new account number. I have written letter after letter asking for a resolution and no response. Now my credit is being screwed up by something that is not even my fault and no one seems to care that this company is just out of control. Any suggestions?"
"Kathy of Oilville, VA","Sept. 2, 2013",1,"A third party installer refused to do the installation, which was not complicated, and was rude and belligerent to the homeowner I rent from and myself. The records at Comcast were altered with incorrect information, stating he did not have permission from the homeowner - when the homeowner was PRESENT, and the customer service representatives and supervisors I have gotten to speak with have been extremely rude and do not believe me. My calls and requests to speak to management while the installer was at my home arguing with the homeowner have been erased. No one wants to speak with the homeowner to verify the behavior of the installer. I have been called a liar basically. They should be doing everything in their power to make sure that this third party installer named Alfonso is never dispatched to anyone's home again. I will be cancelling my service if I cannot get some resolution with someone from management at Comcast. They seem to be a very arrogant company at this point.They brag about their Guarantee but my experience so far is the customer really doesn't matter to Comcast, they just like to print nice words and advertise their kindness and customer care. They ruined an entire holiday weekend with the inconvenience and as a female who lives alone I now feel the need to get an alarm system in my home due to the fact that the creepy, dishonest, installer was in my home and knows where I live. The only concession Comcast is willing to provide for all of this is a $29.95 refund of the installation fee. That is completely unacceptable and as I said, if that is all they are willing to do, I will cancel the service. There is not another internet provider in my area outside of satellite so I may ultimately end up moving so I can be in an area where I have more options than Comcast so I will not have to encounter them in the future.I was formerly a customer with Comcast for 18 years before moving to the country. It has been almost two years since I had access to their services and I do not remember Customer Service being this rude before. When I am in a situation where I have any other option I will never choose Comcast again. For now, I have no choices but to give them the opportunity to resolve my issue. We will see how much time I have to spend in the next few days trying to get that resolution. More than frustrating."
"maryam of Los Gatos, CA","Aug. 28, 2013",1,"Before we moved to California we wanted to sever ties with Comcast but they urged us to stay with them and gave us a deal! Any way a day before the technician was about to connect everything in our new home we lost our access to our email accounts, and I've been calling them for the past 14 days being hung up on and every time I had to explain again and again my problem. No one in that company knows what they are doing. Bunch of imbeciles in that company. I wonder if the higher ups are aware of the incompetence of their employees! Keep this up they will lose all their customers! I am very, very frustrated and quite angry!"
"Suvraj of Fremont, CA","Aug. 27, 2013",1,"I had been customer of AT&T/-Verse for nearly 8+ years. Not once in my life had I any terrible devastating customer service experience with them like I just had with Comcast. After doing some long hard research, I notice it would be worth changing my Internet service to Comcast. The reasons were simple: I had AT&T 12 Mbps and was paying $39.99. Then notice Comcast 25 Mbps for $29.99 for 6 months for newer customers and then $44.95 after the six months.So the reason was simple, I pay a little less for six months and then 11% more every month after 6 months but will get 52% more speed just for 11% more cost. This was the simple reason I called Comcast last week and got the service. I am a first time customer of Comcast so I asked all the questions I know that matters to my Internet service. The representative explained the same rate plan for first 6 months and next 6 months and then I was told the technician will come over to my home this week (August 26th, 2013) to install the modem and turn the service on. I told the representative that I wish not to use their modem due to paying additional $7/Month a rental fee. So I provided the information of the Modem that I wish to use (Motorola SB5100) and the representative mentioned it works with Comcast and would have no problem with the internet service. So I order the modem and today, August 26, 2013, I had my internet service activated from outside my home by Comcast.1st Worst Call Customer Service Experience: HorribleAt 5:40ish PM today, I called Comcast to have my modem active WHICH I WAS TOLD BY THE COMCAST REP THAT WILL WORK. The whole worst experience started with Comcast automated phone service system. I had to find my way around just so I could speak with any representative due to the wait was 1 hour and 15 minutes. It took me 20 minutes before I could speak to one representative. Finally after long 20 minutes, I spoke with a live person who then took my information and took another 10 minutes before he said he will be transferring my call to the Internet Department where they will activate my Motorola Modem. He transferred my call and the representative (female) answered my call and just within a minute, my call got disconnected. After a long 30 minutes when I was about to get my modem activated, my call would get disconnected. I thought someone would call back because all the representatives were constantly asking me my phone number but after 5-10 minutes of wait of not receiving any call, I decided to call again.2nd Worst Call Customer Service Experience: Insulting and Rude BehaviorSo this time, I call again trying to find my way out to somewhat eliminate that 1-hour wait and luckily I did by simply going to Account Department. There I explained the whole situation and the representative transferred my call to the Internet Department after another 15 minutes total wait. This time the representative (male) I spoke with in Internet Department did everything he could just to make my entire first time experience with Comcast a worst Nightmare. I explained to him that I obtained the information regarding the Modem that I personally purchased to use with my service after it was clarified to work with Comcast by Comcast Representative. I provided the details written underneath the modem which was the Serial Number and the MAC ID. After few minutes the representative came back from putting me on hold and said the modem is at the End of Life and will be Broken soon and said I need Docsis 3.0. Now, I did not understand these increments so I asked what that means and he explained that the modem could stop working in the future or one of these days because it will no longer be supported by the Comcast. I explained to him I was given the details by the Comcast Representative last week when I signed up for the service and he NEVER SAID ONCE any of this and neither did he say this is not what I need. So how come after I verified with Comcast and ordered the modem and even canceled my AT&T Service, you guys are telling me today when I will be without Internet by tomorrow. This Internet Department Representative started getting upset at me and said why would I go purchase something else from the market when Comcast will be providing with the Modem and why would I make this decision and coming back to us telling that we had given the wrong information. I felt so insulted and felt if I am Comcast customer then I must become slave and follow what Comcast wants me to do. I asked him that I would like to speak with his immediate manager or supervisor and after a minute or two of putting me on hold, he said he has the supervisor on the line and will be transferring my call. I kept on saying ""Hello? Hello?"" for almost a minute or two after being transferred but I heard no voice and then again like first time, my call was disconnected.3rd Worst Call Customer Service Experience: DisasterThis time I called back again just to simply have the service canceled completely which I did not even use ONE SECOND. So after nearly one hour of time that was wasted and being humiliated and insulted by Comcast Representative, I chose to speak with someone in the Customer Care Department hoping I would find a manager or supervisor there. After a few minutes, I spoke to a female voice who I explained this whole horrendous experience I went through and explained to her that not once had I ever had such experience with AT&T in 8 years of being their customer. For a second, I thought maybe because I was talking to someone in Customer Care Department, this person would do everything to make my experience better. But all this representative said was sorry for what I felt and asked me what she wants me to do now. She said the modem is at End of Life and when I asked if that modem supported WiFi, she said it does not because this model is 2.0 and WiFi modems are 3.0. The whole experience from talking to account representative to Internet representative to Customer Care manager was simply horrible, terrifying, and insulting as it didn't matter to anyone keeping the customer as their account holder. I told her I simply wanted to cancel the service which I just signed up for. She stated to do that I will be transferred to Cancellation Department but I told her that I do not want to go through the hassle again and requested her if she could be the middle person and directly explain to them the whole issue I was facing before transferring my call. She said she will make all the notes of which she and I talked about and the Cancellation Department will review them first. After she made the notes, she said she will now be transferring my call. And as my call was transferred, it once again was disconnected. This time I simply had it with Comcast and again chose the option to go through Customer Care Department and ironically the department was closed because it was 7:08 PM and the customer service department is ONLY OPEN from 7 AM - 7 PM. This person knew this but did not bother to inform me or take the initiative to make my experience any better but simply said, ""I am sorry,"" and transferred my call and after 1 hr and 25 minutes, I end up with no help but with one hell of a disaster customer service experience in my life.I simply want this service that I just signed up for last week on August 19th, 2013 to be cancelled as I do not wish to be a part of the company which has no respect for its customers at all. Honestly, I don't even think i would get any response from whoever I am sending this to after the experience I went through but if you guys have any dignity, then improve your customer service and teach your management to take charge."
"starks of Channahon, IL","Aug. 23, 2013",1,You can spend hours on the phone with Comcast and get no problems resolved. They ask you for all your information then transfer you to someone that can not help you after getting all your information. Then that person puts you on hold and then disconnects you. So you call back again and start that process all over again. Don't get RJ (**); Demetrius (**); Denise (**) Adriane ** (**) or Laura (F squiggly line at top of your computer 4) because they are going to waste two hours of your time. Even after you go into their office no one can get your correct address in their system. Finally someone can disconnect your security service but they will charge you $1100 disconnection fee that no one ever bothered to mention.
"Elvin of Philadelphia , PA","Aug. 22, 2013",1,"I moved in my house August 1st. I had a scheduled appointment for service in my home for 1 or 2 days after my move in date. Appointment was for 3pm. My fiancee got home at 3:10pm and the Comcast tech was sitting outside in his truck. So my fiancee walks over and asked him if he was here for my home and he just shook his head, said no and pulled the window up in her face. So she called Comcast and asked if anyone was coming over to put service in the house that day. They said yeah the tech was there but nobody was home and my fiancee told Comcast that there's a Comcast tech outside and he said he wasn't here for the house so she said oh yeah. He put his paperwork through that nobody was home and then said but regardless of what he should've still provided service if he knew that you hit home. But anyways we got scheduled another day that was like 4 day later. A different tech came out and service home. He did whatever it is he had to do. So he was getting ready to hook the TV on with the box after he finished running all the cable wire. He plugged the cable wire into the cable box and got shocked (red flag something is wrong). Anyways he proceeded, he went and got the hdmi cable and plugged it into the cable box. Then as soon as he plugged in the hdmi to my TV my TV caught fire through the hdmi cable I believe and had me sparks. Now my TV does not work and also my DVD player that was plugged into the TV does not work. So he gathers his stuff, calls Comcast and make a report. 1hr later Maby, his supervisor, came to my house to check up on what happened and went on saying how he apologize for what happened and said that the tech told him sleuthing was wrong with the house. That it was not grounded. And then went on saying how their tech army electricians that they wouldn't have I known if it was grounded or not. So I told him, ""don't you guys give them training on that or you just tell your techs hey listen ummm if you are putting in service in a home and you almost get your face blow off then that means the house has a problem."" But anyhow he went on saying that we should be getting a call that same day nowhere than the next and since their box is what caused all this to happen then they are going to reimburse us for our stuff. 2 days went on and we received no call. So we called and they said we should be getting a call in 6 to 7 days. 6-7 days later no call. We called again and they said we should be getting a call in 24 hours. I let 2 more days pass and no call. So 2 days after that I called again and this time they told me that they don't know why they told me that I would get a call in 6 to 7 days because it takes 30 days. So I got mad and requested a manager. Manager was more cool about things and felt bad about everything I went through and said I should get a call in a day or 2 and if I didn't that I should call back and they would send my report to corporate. So 2 days pass and I get no call. So I call back and it got send to corporate. Next day I get a call from Cable Net and they went on saying that they are not responsible for our stuff because the issue was with the house. We tried explaining to him what happened and he said that his tech told him a different story from what we are saying and that what we are saying isn't in the report. So I said no what I'm telling you is the truth because I saw with my eyes what happened and if report says different then obviously it's just going have down what the tech reported which I'm 100% sure was to back himself up. So now we are going on about close to a month with no service or TV and now after all the ** they put us through they're going to finally call us back just to say they are not responsible for our stuff after everyone else we spoke to from Comcast told us they are going to replace our stuff. So he said he was going call somebody and they was going to contact us back. So now I'm just waiting for a call that I'm sure is not going to come. And I thought to myself first of all I called Comcast to put service in my home, not Cable Net which is a private contractor that help do service for Comcast so I don't know why they made them call me. So I don't know who's paying for my damages but Comcast is going have to do something because did they hired Cable Net to put service in my home that's a issue between them but somebody needs to pay for my stuff. So now I'm just here thinking what else can I possibly do to get this take care off. Is legal actions really my only option? All I want is my TV fixed or replaced and my DVD player, and also some service at a discount for all the ** they put me through. Wish somebody could help me out!!!!"
"Christine of Sebastian, FL","Aug. 16, 2013",2,"We decided to try to get Comcast internet. Service guys were unable to connect because there were no viable outlets. The service call was voided; however we just noticed we have been charged $51.95 a month since March 4th, 2013 (the date of the service call) for non existent internet. The bill has averaged out to about $145.00 monthly. Now all of a sudden there is a $20.00 rate hike for Digital Preferred. What was $39.95 is now $59.95. This in addition to the charge for invisible internet has become ridiculous."
"robin of Fremont, CA","Aug. 10, 2013",1,I've called Comcast multiple times to complain about the speed I am getting from WiFi. They have been telling me to purchase a plan so that they can  troubleshoot the issue. Their technician confirmed that problem is with the equipment Comcast provides. I am getting decent speed if I am hardwired. I have one of their high plans as per which I should get at least 30mbps but I am getting only 5 Mbps.
"Han of Hamilton, VA","Aug. 3, 2013",1,"I have switched to Comcast triple bundle package from a single service (internet), but problem occurred when I found out that I have been overpaying Comcast. When I called Comcast, they have told me that I have been charged with the single service (internet) I used to have because someone did not cancel my previous service, therefore, I have been paying double internet service fee. I have started the chain of command and I was able to talk with the operation manager and got some of the money back into my account. But, the problem still persisted when I saw my bill statement. The bill I received had $35 extra from what I have been quoted for. I was very irritated and angry, so I called Comcast again. When I spoke with the representative they could not do anything unless their supervisor approves it. Also, I have requested for the supervisor to call me but they did not call me back. In addition, one of the recent representative told me to pay up the delinquent fee and get the credit later. I was very frustrated when she told me that. I am still waiting from them to resolve the issue, but I am getting tire calling them and don't think this will be a easy one to resolve. Please help."
"Thomas of Heiskell, TN",41486,1,"I upgraded to the Xfinity internet with Comcast and have had nothing but trouble with tech support. The techs are just probable just doing their jobs and are polite, but the problem is they want to transfer you to level 2 if level 1 can't fix the problem. They must be from some foreign country as they are hard to understand and don't listen to what you are saying. They ask for the same information over and over. Then they repeat what they said several times and by the time you tell them the problem, they want to know the same thing over again until you become so frustrated you want to throw the phone at them. Well, by the time you get to level 2, they want to charge for the service level 1 couldn't handle. This is not the first time I have had trouble with them. I switched to Comcast several years ago and it took 6 months to get the billing and problems fixed."
"Brian of Albany, CA",41482,1,"Comcast sent a new modem, promising it would deliver much faster internet speeds. I dutifully installed it. Sometimes speeds were great, other times they were terrible. I called support, and they tried resetting it. No help. They then passed me onto service level 2, who inform me that for a mere $80 they'd help me solve the problem. I protest that the problem began with their new equipment, and that charging me $80 for making it work as advertised is tantamount to charging me $80 for my ""free"" new modem. They refused to engage with this argument, and insisted that I could either pay the $80 or attempt to have level 1 service (free) fix the problem. And they assure me that level 1 service cannot fix the problem. Total scam. This company is run by piratical leeches. STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST!!!!!"
"Marcia of Snellville, GA",41480,1,"For the past several days, we have experienced terrible internet connectivity. Normally we do not have major problems, but it has been a chore just to browse the internet or even read email. Not to mention the fact that both my son and I play online games. I just spent a frustrating 15 minutes just trying to get the Comcast technician to slow down and speak clearly enough so I could understand what he was saying relative to the connectivity issues I explained to him. Got disconnected in the middle of that only to get him back on the line and then he kept saying he could not hear me. Instead of trying to find a supervisor, he said there was none available...so I was stuck. Then the call disconnected again....I suspect he just hung up on me.Comcast NEEDS to fix their service problems. Having no alternative to calling in to get another technician or even a supervisor to help if the technician one is speaking with is not helping, is a major problem. Then to top all this off, the very first thing he tells me is our modem is obsolete...and will fail to function within a few month's time. Excuse me? He could not explain that comment to my satisfaction, so he got irritated with me and wanted me to connect my PC directly to the modem bypassing the router. My answer to that was this: If we had decent connectivity up until just a few days ago, how does that change things when we have not changed equipment in our house? Does not make sense.I can't seem to find a direct line to complain to them so came here to submit this complaint. It would be nice if Comcast had someone we could actually speak to without all the runaround and idiotic answers their technicians seem to give us for comment problems."
"Lynn of Jacksonville, FL",41479,1,"Have had issues off and on for the past year. Most notable being kicked off the internet while working, and having to reconnect, sometimes as often as several times an hour. Have spent countless hours on the phone with tech support and have had at least 4 technicians come to my home, crawling through the attic, climbing poles outside, and even replacing the modem. And yet the problem persists. At one point last Sept I signed up for ""Signature Support"" thinking that because I was paying extra for the service, I would get improved service... NOT! Not only did I spend hours on the phone with them trying to resolve problems, but they said the problem was not with the router but the computer. They would gladly fix it for an additional fee (by the way it was NOT the computer). At that point in October I realized this was a scam and called to cancel the service. I documented the phone call because I truly couldn't make this up - it was so absurd. I was on the phone for over 2.5 hours and this is what transpired; the first person I spoke with was in Texas. After explaining the entire situation to her, I was told she was not authorized to remove this service, or charges from my bill. I was then transferred to a gentleman in Manila. Once again explaining the situation, he tried to assure me the service was worth keeping; however I told him I wanted it removed and I wanted an updated bill to document that it actually had been removed. He was not authorized to do so and transferred me to a lady in Manila. Once again I fully explained the situation. After lengthy discussion she said she also could not help me and transferred me to CHICAGO. Once again explaining the situation and asking for an updated bill I was told simply to deduct the fee from my bill. I certainly did not trust this instruction and when I asked again was transferred back to Manila! I gave up!! I did deduct the fee from my bill and could write another paragraph about the results but at this point won't waste more time, other than it took 2 more months and at least 3 more phone calls to get the issue resolved. This company used to be the best around. They expanded TOO fast; with WAY too much decentralization of services to be remotely consumer friendly. In their need to compete with other companies (primarily Uverse in our area) they turned into the antithesis of what they once were. Once again a tech came to my house yesterday. I was told that a month after the service (bundled package) was installed in my home last yr the modem code reverted from the ""promotion"" code, which gave me complete services, to a previous code (partial service) which was why I continued to have problems throughout the past year. (4 previous tech visits never figured this out) To add insult to injury I received my bill which had increased by $20 this month. I called Comcast to ask why and was told the first year pricing was a promotion and July marked the beginning of the second yr. When I asked to have the bill adjusted for the service I did not receive I was transferred -- guess where??-- tech support in MANILA. Not only did they not know who the technician was whom had come to my house, but they had no idea what he did other than the report which stated ""wifi in proper working order"". Tech support in Manila has no idea what tech support in Jax is doing. When I told the lady in Manila the problem occurred once again this AM... guess where they sent me?? ---- Signature Support in Manila--- where I was assured that for a fee my problem would be resolved once and for all. Needless to say, and after my previous experience with Signature Support, I completely lost my temper. Won't bore you with the followup. Needless to say... if you are in a community that offers an alternative to Comcast, don't hesitate."
"brooke of Adrain, MI",41479,1,I got the home security and internet and cable package and they told me it will be $150 a month. I got my first bill and it was $500. Next month it was $700 so I stopped using them. They are really rude to you when you ask them a question about the bill.
"David of Stillwater, MN",41476,1,"On Sundays, my internet speed drops to 2.2 download and 1.4 upload according to Speedtest.net. The rest of the week I am usually in the +20 download, +6.5 upload. Comcast's poor customer phone service routed through the Philippines always insists it is my equipment. US management agreed to run a test the day of the problem the next time I called, but you cannot get that message through their inept specialists overseas that answer the calls. How can you pay more and get less? Satisfaction guaranteed? No way. We really need competition to keep them honest in their claims or at least give us an option."
"W of Miami, FL",41474,1,"Comcast essentially has a monopoly in our area, with all other choices being as bad as their services. I have felt overcharged, abused, and have been flat-out lied to about my services and billing. I can't wait for Comcast to go out of business forever."
"TONY of Olympia, WA",41474,1,"On July 2, I contacted Comcast moving service. After a thirty-minute call the analyst transferred me to another person. This person would supposedly set up a service person to come to my slip and confirm services were available. This second call took another 30 minutes. I was issued a service ticket number and told to call back if I did not hear from the service person by the following Monday. No call from any Comcast employee. I called again and spoke with another analyst. This person could not comprehend that if there was service at B24, B10 and B3 there should be service at B7. This person told me, ""Sorry, I can't help you. Call the moving specialist (the number I called was to the moving service)."" I spent another 35 minutes on this call. I called the next number and was told that the analyst would check into the problem and that I should call back in one hour. This analyst sent me a link that would supposedly get me back to her so I would not have to explain the issue again. When I called the link I got another person who was clueless to what I was trying to accomplish. He transferred my call to yet another person who promised that by the next Wednesday, I would be contacted by a field service agent. No call on Wednesday. I called again and after going through the whole issue one more time, I was told I would be contacted by that Friday. No call. I called again and talked to another person who seemed to understand the issue. He could see that there was service on the dock. He gave me another ticket number and said that I would be contacted by this Thursday. No call again. So it has been 16 days and over five hours of my time trying to just get Comcast to transfer my service 100 yards from slip 43A to B7. How can I resolve this and get my service moved and be reimbursed for the days I was not provided service after my move request?"
"Pamela of El Dorado Hills, CA",41470,1,"Telephoned Comcast to order service on April 16, 2013. Informed Comcast that my move in date was May 1, 2013. A deposit was required and made to obtain a Bundle service. On May 4, 2013 received a bill asking for payment for one month. Telephoned Comcast and informed them that I had just moved in on May 1, 2013. Comcast informed me that statements commence on the date of order even though services are not provided. On May 1, 2013 a service representative came to my home to install services. While ordering phone, TV, and Internet, the installer only installed TV. Was informed that he had another appointment and had to leave. Leaving me high and dry.While the installer was at my home he broke a $300.00 figurine that was fifteen years old. Telephoned Comcast to advise of damage. A Comcast representative told me that a report would be written and the matter would be closed in three to five days. After three weeks, telephoned Comcast to ask for update on damage issue. At that time, the rep informed me that Comcast was not handling the matter and I should contact Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. Each time when telephoning Liberty Mutual the agent was nasty and refused to assist me.Finally after a four-week wait Liberty Mutual told me that their company was a third party and would not pay for any damage. Liberty Mutual was told that I DID NOT BREAK the figurine the installer did. Telephoned Comcast and reported the discussion with Liberty Mutual to the CEO office and was informed that an executive would contact me to resolve the matter. Three days later a representative - not an executive - telephoned me and told me that Comcast was not going to help me even though they did receive confirmation that the installer did own up to the breakage of my figurine. A week later a check in the amount of $110.00 was received with a take it or leave it statement. Deposited the check and immediately cancelled services with Comcast as I will not deal with such a dishonest company.How do you allow this Company to continue to do business? Comcast continually fabricates, increases payments without notification, does not adhere to agreed prices and denies or feigns no knowledge of what is told from one representative to another, and will not take ownership for what they do. Along with what occurred above Comcast billed for incorrect amounts and did NOT record payments paid. This all took place in a seven-week period!!!! This Company should NOT be allowed to continue to provide any type of so called service to the public. Thank you for allowing me to inform you of what takes place with Comcast."
"angie of Miami, FL",41467,1,We've had so many issues with Comcast. They disconnected our internet service for no reason. They are so incompetent. ItŠ—Ès unfortunate they are such a monopoly.
"Marcus of San Rafael, CA",41466,2,"Back in May, Comcast announced, ""We just increased your Internet speed."" All that was required was that I have a modem with DOCSYS 3.0, so I purchased a new $100 Motorola modem with DOCSYS 3.0 and hooked it up. I called Comcast to activate the connection. Fine and dandy so far. However, according to the Comcast reps, we're supposed to be getting a minimum of 20 Mbps -- something we have NEVER experienced. We've been lucky to get as high as 1.2 Mbps on rare occasions; usually, we settle for 700 kbps. But then, in the middle of June, downloads dropped to a start of 500 kbps, and then, within 2-3 minutes, it dropped to 20 kbps, rarely completing any download.We've run numerous antivirus programs, Malwarebytes malware scrubber, CCleaner clutter cleaner, defragged hard drives, etc. ALL of these indicate that our PCs are squeaky clean. Ergo, the problem MUST be from Comcast's side. When I contacted Tech Support, they checked from their side and stated that we should be getting that minimum of 20 Mbps. Beyond that, a tech would need to be sent, and if the problem was ascertained to be non-Comcast, it would cost $50. OR, I could agree to pay $3.99 per month forever for the Service Protection Plan.This smacks of a Protection racket scam: sell something, drop the performance to generate the trouble call, then sell ""insurance"" to correct the problem, especially when the fine print reads, ""Restrictions apply. Not available in all areas. Speed increase affects Performance Internet customers. Actual speeds vary and are not guaranteed."""
"William of San Carlos, CA",41452,1,"I was going to cancel my service and they talked me into staying on with a faster internet service and a new modem. Of course, when I got the new modem, it worked on the landline but the wireless portion did not work. Yes, I know it is cap sensitive and a million charters. When I called in to the little brochure, they slipped in the package it was for signature support services. They wanted to charge me for the support of something they just sent me that did not work. I said that was silly and she said this was the only department that could help with wireless... I hung up with her and called back in, getting cut off two times and spending over 3 hours of my time. I believe the issue is finally fixed now but that remains to be seen. The last service person was great... The three people I spoke with before her were very bad and did not follow through or help me with my problem. I want to switch to Dish or DirecTV now very badly..."
"Charles of Jacksonville, FL",41449,1,"On any given day, I would easily achieve speeds between 16.00/25.00. In the beginning, I rented Comcast's WiFi Router combo, but it was a P.O.S. as well, so I returned it and purchased a separate router & modem (I've read it's a preferred option); speeds seem to be far better than previously. However, as of last week, the same problem started once again. I've been experiencing slow to ridiculously slow internet speeds, mostly in the evenings and between the hours of 4PM - 8PM. Download speeds were between 0.44/1.08 & Upload unaffected, and steady between 4.00/5.00. The worst was last night. I purchased an HD movie from iTunes and usually it would begin 1-2 min. after purchase. This time, I was getting a message on screen advising a time movie would be ready to view, as it was ""loading"" and it jumped from 1 hr. 36 min to as high as 3 hours!. After 45 min., and a reset of modem, movie began to play. I stopped calling Comcast Customer Service. It's pointless since they always assume it's on the customer's end, and they do the usual system checks and ask you to turn off modem and restart. B.S., I tell you. I believe they are doing something to slow the speeds down during these times, but what can the consumer do? My only other option is AT&T, but only DSL is available, and why should I switch? If I'm paying for high speed service with Comcast, I should expect top speeds no matter what time of day it may be. Frustrating, I tell."
"Brad of Jensen Beach, FL",41448,1,"I have relied on Comcast's services for both my home and office. I can't use the internet at either. This has been going on today and yesterday. I have contacts that need to go out and I can't send them due to outages. This is costing me thousands of dollars and could be detrimental to my business. We also have payroll that we rely on intranet connection to complete. If the problem isn't resolved soon, people will go without paychecks tomorrow."
"Alex of Lake Worth, FL",41443,1,"My horrible experience with Comcast started a few weeks ago. My boss and I were working late one evening when we noticed that neither one of us could send emails with attachments from any of our multiple webmail accounts (it is worth mentioning that my boss and I work out of his house). This problem forced us to call it quits. The next morning, I find out that after I left the previous evening, my boss spent several hours on the phone with Comcast and did not get the issue resolved. It is then my turn to call Comcast and after talking with several support advisors for hours, including a manager, I got nowhere. After wasting my entire morning, I finally spoke with someone who seems to know more/is more intelligent than the previous Comcast employees that I spoke with. I am told that the reason we are having internet problems is related to the fact that Comcast recently upgraded internet speeds in our area. Apparently, the modem we had (which was rented from Comcast) was not allowing us to access the higher speeds and according to the support person was the root of our problems. I was told that we needed a new modem and that Comcast could send one to us in 3-5 days. Since my boss and I work out of his house, we couldn't wait that long and I went to Best Buy immediately and bought an appropriate modem. It is worth noting that Comcast never sent out a notice in the mail explaining the internet speed increase and the fact that existing equipment might need to be upgraded in order to gain access to the faster speeds.After I installed the new modem and registered it with Comcast, the problem continued. I called a friend who works in the IT industry and he told me to run a speed test. After doing this, I learned that the download speed on the internet is fine but the upload speed is very poor and is the reason we are having problems sending emails with attachments. Again I called up Comcast and after a long conversation, I was told to contact a special technical support department in order to get the problem resolved. I spoke with a manager in this department who explained to me that the problem is on our end with the new modem and can be fixed, but they were going to charge us 50 some odd dollars to do so. At this point, I was fuming mad and told the manager that this was unacceptable. The conversation went nowhere and hang up. I called the regular Comcast support again, and after more time wasting, it is determined that the best course of action is to have a technician to come to my bossŠ—Ès house.The technician went 3 days later. At some point in days before the appointment, the download speed issue had somehow been fixed and everything was working fine. I could send emails with large attachments without any problems. The technician looked over all the components and checked the cables, and everything was working great.Fast forward a week and one morning, the internet goes from connected to unconnected every few minutes and eventually stays unconnected. I call Comcast again and spend my entire morning trying to have someone help me figure out whatŠ—Ès going on. I tell the Comcast person my experience from the previous week and they decide the best course of action is to send out a technician to the house again. The Comcast person I spoke with tells me that they also want to send a different technician to check the cables and components at the street level. However, based on the schedule, the earliest they can send that technician out is in 4 WEEKS!! I find this totally unacceptable and am told that this is the best they can do.A day or so later, my boss speaks with a neighbor down the street who has been experiencing the similar problems with their Comcast internet. The house technician shows up two days after this and we are finally told the truth. THE ENTIRE STREET AND NEIGHBORING STREETS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS!! The fact that my boss and I wasted a total of 3 working days trying to figure out what was going on with the internet was very upsetting. The worst part of this experience was Comcast repeatedly telling us that the internet issues we were experiencing were on our end of things. They were not being truthful with the fact that we were one of many in the area that were experiencing the same issues, meaning that the problems were in fact on their end. We still donŠ—Èt know what the exact reason/cause is for the internet issues because the street level technician wonŠ—Èt show up for another few weeks. As far as we know, issues with the internet could still occur at any time. We are currently looking into other internet providers in hopes that we find one that is reliable."
"Janet of Paradise, CA",41442,1,"After three live chats and then two phone calls, still I have no resolution. They wanted to sell me something and then switch me to another agent to charge me for something that Xfinity should be taking care of. I am trying to access my email on my desktop and it keeps coming up access denied. It was fine a week ago. I am ready to go to another service provider. This is so frustrating. NO HELP!"
"Tj of Grosse Ile, MI",41439,1,"After subscribing to Triple Play Services, I have had nothing but negative experiences with Comcast. The problem is that the company has grown into the largest cable provider in the world and its customer service has suffered. I attempted to use their self-install option, but after numerous calls, it was determined that I did not have service into my home. This was after several Comcast representatives assured me that I had service into the home. I scheduled an appointment for Saturday, but Comcast arrived on Friday morning instead. The technician left a note stating, ""No In-feed, requires Professional Installation.""After calling customer service and speaking to four different representatives, I was advised that it would be a minimum charge of over $200.00 for professional installation. I now have an appointment for Sunday, but I will be returning their equipment to their technician and stopping my scheduled service. For some reason, these companies do not value the time of their customers, and for this reason alone, I will seek a better option."
"George of Spring, TX",41438,1,"I chose Comcast/Xfinity to be our DSL and alarm provider, but their actions were not professional from the beginning. We were given a few credits by their corporate office for several no shows, in which one caused us to miss the delivery of important information for our uncle's funeral. The installation person would say that he would be at our house at a certain time, but he did not show up or give a courtesy call. This would jeopardize our work schedule because most of the appointments were on a weekday.Comcast/Xfinity finally installed the equipment, but the billing credits had not been posted and the balance represented the wrong promotional rates. This caused the bill to be incorrect; it continued to be incorrect throughout the months of service. I have made many requests for them to produce a correct bill. Here is a list of problems that I have attempted to resolve with Comcast/Xfinity: This is the message that I receive as I access the Comcast.net portal to check and control things in my house, while out of town: ""Page Error; your account has been suspended. Please contact your service provider to resolve the situation.""My bill has been incorrect since February 2013. Although I have made every attempt to get a bill that shows the correct amount, I continue to see the wrong amount. Internet speed is supposed to have been the fastest, but it seemed sometime slower than my regular AT&T internet speed.Although I had my alarm checked more than once, I still experience the same problems. Four times this past month, I have come home and entered my code to disarm my home alarm. The alarm continues to beep after I have entered the code several times, until the siren finally sound off. Tanisha ** (Executive Customer Relations Houston Region) sent someone out to check this problem. He diagnosed the problem as the code being entered too fast. If I enter the code and one digit does not respond, I will not get another chance to re-enter the code and disarm the alarm. This will eventually lead to the alarm siren sounding. If my alarm constantly triggers, my neighbors will soon ignore it and that leaves opportunity for a real burglary to occur unnoticed. Another problem is the complaints of my alarm going off early in the morning and in our quiet neighborhood; it is disturbing my neighbors. I did not have this problem with my old alarm system!My email system no longer keeps track of when someone enters or leave my house.I could not monitor or control features in my house for weeks all because of reasons mentioned. I made several requests for Mrs. ** to give me the service that I paid for or cancel my contract. Without any attempt to resolve the problems and give adequate service, she immediately canceled my service the same day. I believe this decision was made to avoid giving the credits that were supposed to post to my billing account. I also believe that her decision was an attempt to avoid honoring the very low promotional rate that was offered in the beginning. When I spoke to her the same day that she disconnected my service, she told me that I would not receive a refund for the poor service received the entire time of service. She also made sure to inform me that by taking this matter up with corporate CEO (Brian Roberts), it will only trickle back down to her.I sent Mrs. ** a final email as an attempt to get her to correct the problems. I told her that I'd really rather have this situation resolved and allow them an opportunity to give better service. She told me that my service had already been cancelled and it would cost me installation fees again. She also informed me that the special promotional rates would not be available. This definitely demonstrates how unethical and unscrupulous Comcast/Xfinity is to their customer. To lure a customer in with promotions and not give the service that is expected, but cancel the customer's account instead of attempting to resolve the problems is just ludicrous and immoral.I am requesting that my full service be restored along with the same promotions that were tied to the account; I also need all issues and concerns resolved: I need my bill to reflect the proper amount online moving forward. I need the keypad that does not properly work replaced with one that does work. I need to be able to control and monitor my system online without error. I need your system to do everything that Comcast/Xfinity advertised it to do. I need my high speed internet to reach the speed advertised in the promotion.My house that was monitored under Central Security is unmonitored and can be broken in at any time. If service cannot be restored, I would like a full refund of any amount paid to Comcast/Xfinity!"
"Marcus of San Francisco, CA",41435,1,"I have been paying $140 a month for a bundle service. The internet is supposed to be at 50 mbps. I run an average of 2-5 mbps since having the service. I don't have time to be dealing with this, but have still followed the technician's advice of changing out the modem and setting up an appointment for a visit. On the phone, Comcast claims that the only evidence of my internet not working is based on call logs of me calling in. The billing individual said that I was lying and that the problem pre-existed any phone calls I have made to Comcast. I tried explaining I don't have the time to deal with these problems... considering yesterday and today alone I have spent over 6 hours dealing with the problem that remains unresolved. The evidence I have been paying for service I don't receive lies in the fact I have to have someone come out here to troubleshoot a more fundamental problem with my service, not in the phone call log. All I ask is that I am reimbursed for services paid for but not received, but Comcast refuses. There are few choices in terms of switching service and I need internet for my work. There must exist a remedy for this problem."
"Patrick of Baltimore, MD",41434,1,"My first 24h as a Comcast customer:I called the local representative, on the advice of the building I am renting from, where I received the guarantee that I had the best deal. He charged me a price higher than what was available online and set up a connection inferior to the one I paid for, as well as was slow and discourteous in his communications. I first contacted Comcast's live chat to address this. The person was unhelpful, rude and terminated the chat, not wanting to change anything even though I didn't even get the plan I paid for. I then contacted Comcast on the phone. The 2nd person I spoke with finally fixed these 2 issues, but sent me to tech support because my speed tests were not up to what I had paid for. Finally, this issue was resolved by tech support. The day goes by, I noticed significant problems trying to stream video content at a high resolution, with a high amount of stuttering - a problem I didn't have at my previous ISP. I look things up and indeed the content was being throttled by Comcast: (a) their support forums discussed extensively how this was a recurring issue for streaming with Comcast; (b) this problem was independent on my hardware as I previously had no issues and the remainder of the internet worked; (c) my girlfriend, who still had the previous ISP, had no problems; and (d) the problem resolved through the use of a VPN that prevented Comcast from monitoring traffic. I spent 2 hours on the phone speaking with 5 different people to resolve this issue. Most people did not understand what I was talking, as they weren't particularly tech savvy despite being technical support. The last person that I spoke to about this became very quiet very suddenly when confronted with the evidence. Frequently, tech support would try to get me to sign up to a signature Comcast tech support that charged over $30 just to sign up, in addition to a $5-6 monthly fee, which is ludicrous and infuriating. It is interesting to note the FCC fined Comcast for throttling their customers' internet only within the last few years.So in summary, in 24h, Comcast's employees were dishonest about their offers, bait and switched my service, were rude and unhelpful when I tried to address them, made things extensively difficult to resolve and then tried to not only cover a blatantly illegal practice, but tried to again engage in dubious behavior to charge me for a service I don't need."
"Rick of Jacksonville, FL",41429,1,"So the previous tenant moved out and scheduled service disconnect on the 4th. I called on the fourth and got transferred around because the old account was still active. The operator told me he can still connect my service because the old one is scheduled to be disconnected the same day. Anyways, he went through his spiel about the packages. I told him no, I don't want a contract or a package; I want the cheapest TV and internet month to month. He then kept bringing up the packages. I told him no. He then brought up the packages again. I told him that I want the cheapest, cheapest service, and he told me the Digital Preferred is the cheapest. I know heŠ—Ès lying so I told him I will call back after I look up the services online. The cheapest TV is Limited Basic and $25 a month, and I choose Performance Starter at 6 MB for $50 a month. I called back and the operator told me he Š—“cannot activate servicesŠ— because even though the previous tenantŠ—Ès scheduled disconnection was today, Comcast was not actually going to come out and disconnect the service till the 26th... and that I would have to go to the nearest Comcast service building to get them to change the disconnect date. How what???"
"Tina of Springfield, TN",41427,1,"After many, many, many hours on the phone with Comcast and 4 appointments for service calls and one ""bucket truck tech"" who came out and fixed my down internet but refused to tell me what was wrong, saying, ""I am not at liberty to tell you what I fixed"" and whom Comcast says they have NO RECORD of coming out (?!), my internet is down again. It was suggested today that because I have economy internet - even though it worked perfectly for 6 months that now no longer works - well, it's economy! So this service tech did not even come out. This is 3 weeks of internet that does not work for many hours a day. It is obvious that they want me to take a more expensive internet service or they will continue shutting me down."
"Sandra  of Pittsburgh, PA",41425,1,I have wasted so much time and still don't have my problem solved. A level one agent in Pittsburgh caused me more problems and more headaches because of his poor skills. I am so frustrated I can't even tell you. This is the worst company ever!!!
"Vickie of Franklin, TN",41415,1,"I pay over $300 a month for the bundle service - cable TV, telephone and internet. I have three televisions on HD cable and pay extra for each of the HD boxes. The biggest problem we have is with the internet service. The service will all of a sudden disconnect from the Internet. When you troubleshoot the problem, it will say check your modem/router connections, which I have done. We have several computers in the house and the disconnect does not happen all at once - it is random on each computer. It would seem to me if there was a router/modem connection problem that they would all go down at the same time. You can be responding to an email and go to send your response - no connection. I have tried to contact customer service and have not been connected. I tried to email them two days ago and my entire email system went down and I did not receive emails yesterday. I have not called because I know they will say it is my equipment and we will have to buy new/pay for a service visit. We have been customers of Comcast since they first entered the market here over 25 years ago. We are starting to look at other options. I am tired of being held hostage. If it were just me, I would disconnect everything but I have a sports fanatic and grandchildren who watch on-demand and cartoon network."
"None of Morton Grove, IL",41389,1,"Ever since we moved into the 2-flat we are in, our cable has simply not worked. Anytime we try to access the On Demand, we get the same error message for no reason which tells us to call and/or unplug and reset our box. If we do this, it takes 5-6 days for the TV to fill in. We have ""To Be Announced"" on almost every channel and it will fill in literally one hour ahead of where we presently are every two hours. We will have no movie channels. We can't watch anything because it will just say ""To Be Announced"" if we go to a channel where the TV isn't showing the title. I have called at least 70 times over the years and then I gave up. We were told something must be interfering with the signal from our box/apartment to their satellites-tower-whatever (they are about a mile from us). The tower is less than four blocks. We have had seven technicians out here this year alone. Some are beyond stupid. One guy said he'd been working there two weeks. They stand and scroll through the menu stuff, reset the box (again) and if it works, it will work for a week or two, then the same thing happens all over. Over the last two years, they have replaced the wire coming in from outside, sent us a new box (two years ago) and claimed they found various things outside on the pole/building from little tears in the wires to I don't know what. One guy got curious at me when he had to come back that same day to replace the cable from outside into our wall because after 7 hours it wasn't fixed even though he said that would be the next step, I guess for someone else to do. This week, I called starting Wednesday of last week to report that all the TV guide was out again. We had bad storms so I said maybe that was it, and yes, I had unplugged the cables, let it sit an hour, plugged it all back in and it was not helping. I told the guy not to reset the box as we had one day of TV guide filling in (so we could see three hours ahead of us on the guide) and so of course, he reset the box anyway. (I was talking to Mexico.) I said I did not want to be rude but asked if I can get a number or talk to someone in the US who does the tech stuff as I have done this to death. He said no, they had no way to do that. He said he'd schedule an appointment for me which was today, the 25th, over a week since I called. I said that was unacceptable and he said that's all he had. He connected me to billing. I was on hold for seven minutes then got disconnected. At this point, I'd been on the phone for three hours and had things to do so I gave up for the day.The next day, I called again and (got Mexico) asked for a supervisor. The guy said he couldn't give me one unless I told him what was wrong and he decided I needed one. I told him the same story. He listened and then put me on hold for 9 minutes. The supervisor got on. I had to tell him the whole thing again. He said there was nothing they could do, but he would give me an appointment sooner, on Tuesday the 24th between 1 and 3. I said fine. He said he would have one of the technicians call us the next day. (No one called again, third time promised.) I called billing and was told by the girl that they could not issue any credits until the tech came out and fixed things, then they can refund money.So we went without TV for a week. When the appointment came on Wednesday, no one showed up. I called and was told that they hadn't told us we had one for sure. He had just said he would try to get me one earlier. This is total ** as I had the guy on speakerphone and my husband also heard him make this appointment as we talked about who would take off work to be home for it. They said we had the appointment for Thursday from 3-5. So here it is Thursday and not only did I take off work 1/2 day, again, to be here but at 20 minutes to 5, Prince Telecommunications called me to tell me they were Comcast and they were really sorry but the guy was running terrifically late and would be here between 6 and 6:30 probably. I said fine and hung up on her. What are you supposed to do?This has been one week with no TV, but this same issue has gone on the entire 13 years we have lived here. We have tried just to put up with it but my nephews are staying with us and no one can ever watch TV. Yet, Comcast calls us at least once a week soliciting, trying to get us to change to their internet service even though we were told that if we have these much problems with the cable, we probably wouldn't have much luck with internet either. The last time someone came out to fix this, Comcast called us relentlessly asking us to take various phone surveys. I literally called and told them if they didn't stop, I'd file a harassment claim. I had to block two of their numbers, it was so bad. How they get away with this is beyond me. Why they are allowed to is purely politics. How many decades have people been complaining about Comcast? I am also tired of calling and getting 15 minutes of ads and menu options just to talk to a human being who can do something."
"Malissa of Oakley, CA",41368,1,"I have had endless issues with Comcast since I started using their services. The most recent and most outrageous incident occurred this month. There are many complaints that I have:First, we have complained multiple times that our internet is extremely slow and that we think it may be the modem that Comcast provided to us. They have sent technicians over and they suggested changing our router. So we bought a new router for $80 (the one they recommended) and it didn't change a thing. They refused to admit that it was the modem. Our internet would be down for days at a time! And coincidentally, when we called for a technician to come, it would start working the day before they were scheduled to come. Coincidence? I think not.Recently, our internet was down for 3 days during the time Comcast was changing to faster download speeds. So we called a tech to come out and fix the problem since they were not able to fix the problems over the phone. So the tech said that the modem (the one that Comcast provided to begin with) was not compatible with the new download speeds. What?! So he switched out the modem and tried to leave before the internet was working. So we said, ""Um, excuse me, it's not fixed."" The tech then stated something might be wrong with the router (lame excuse for not following through and completing his job). Our router works just fine; mind you, it's the brand new one we just bought. So we gave it some time to link up with the modem and finally the internet started to work!Now, prepare yourself for this one! The next bill came and there was a $50 additional charge for a tech to come out and swap out their faulty equipment. The customer service agent said that he couldn't do anything but take off $25! This is absurd! Why am I paying for your faulty equipment? This is by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had!In conclusion, Comcast has fraudulently charged me for their own defective equipment and I will be cancelling my service with them and potentially filing a lawsuit and complaint for the grief they have put me through in the past 6 months."
"Sherry of Tupelo, MS",41365,1,"My internet service stopped working on March 27. I called the 800 number and spoke to a rep. The rep did some troubleshooting and found that my modem is no longer working. The rep then told me to go to the local office and have the modem exchanged. I specifically asked the rep to make sure the local office would be able to exchange the modem. She said yes, they carry the modem in the office and would be able to exchange it. When I arrived at the local office, I was told they do not carry the modem and therefore could not exchange it. The local rep said she would put in a ticket for a technician to exchange my modem on March 28 after 3:30PM. I waited for the rep, but no one showed. Today, April 1, I called to report the incident and to reschedule a new time for a tech to exchange my modem. The CSR said the only time available is Thursday or Friday this week. I take online classes and this is my only internet service. We have had Comast service for years and think we deserve better service than what we are receiving. I am very disappointed and have been trying to reach a manager. I am getting the runaround from the CSR. I need help now!"
"Michael of Harwich Port, MA",41361,1,"We were loyal Comcast customers for twenty years. Due to financial incentives, we went with Verizon this month (March 12, 2013). We returned the Comcast box and modem to their service center the next day. Several years ago the router they provided us with failed and Comcast told us we had to get a new one at our expense, which we did. Now they claim they want the defective router returned and we have no idea what happened to it. Verizon provides a modem/router unit and Comcast is trying to charge us $45.00 for the old router. Why didn't they ask before? You think we'll ever be Comcast customers again and that we won't tell others of our experience?"
"Tracy of Jacksonville, FL",41361,1,"My wife was on the phone with Comcast for well over 6 hours today and yesterday, was transferred from one rep to another, cut off twice and forwarded to a voicemail. Really stellar service, guys! I have had Comcast service for many, many years. I have had the same email for that entire time and have used the same modem and router now for the last 2-3 years without service problems. Now, it seems that when I want to move my service to a new address, no one seems to know how to fix it! I am only on now because of my iPhone and the wifi in my new building (which is painfully slow)! My wife and I operate home-based businesses and rely on the internet. I can suffer without the cable TV for a day or two, but cannot be without the net, for which they have already billed me for. We had an expedited service call with a confirmation number to have a tech come to our house today. After no show, we called again and after an hour on the phone was told that someone called and came by, but we were not there. That is simply not true. Phone records support no call and a service tech must check in with our concierge to enter the building which was not done! Poor service and dishonest too! I posted numerous complaints to their Facebook page since their corporate website is useless and this is what I got from them moments ago: ""Tracy, your FB posts have also been shared with the executives at corporate. You can also send your detailed account to the email address you used yesterday (comcast_cares@comcast.com). Just to let you know, we removed the multiple posts with the phone number listed.""So you see, they have decided to remove my posts, rather than fix the problem. Really smooth!"
"L of Us, MI",41361,1,"If internet service wasn't needed, I would have said good riddance to Comcast a long time ago. But since there are very few alternatives, I will remain a hostage of terrible customer service, awful download speeds (that is understandable since I pay for the fastest speeds possible), moronic website and excuses up the gazoo. Did I mention how much I despise Comcast? And too think this is 2013 and we are still living in an industrial infrastructure. Crumbling bridges, roads or should I say potholes that pass for roads? It's time for this country to catch up with the rest of the world so that when the wind blows, we still have internet service."
"Samantha of Chevy Chase, MD",41347,1,"How is it legal that Comcast is allowed to raise my bill by 27% without notifying me and with no improvement in service? Their prices are completely inflated and since they have a monopoly, it pretty much seems they can get away with whatever they want. This is highway robbery. It's actually quite a stupid business model - rather than keeping me as a loyal customer by providing a service at a fair rate, they piss me off and blatantly screw me over with this ridiculousness. Now I'm looking into other options. Everyone I know feels the same way. How do they get away with this?"
"Bekaar of Palo Alto, CA",41338,1,"I switched internet service from AT&T to Comcast. A big mistake. Now, I cannot watch PBS NewsHour videos. Everything else (Netflix, CBS, NBC) works fine but not PBS. Their customer service rep says (on a chat service) that the problem is with the site. This is an old, completely lame excuse that I discovered Comcast was using two years ago with Netflix service until Netflix agreed to pay them a fee for service. It is one thing to block a commercial site, but to block a public service site is horrible. The executives at Comcast should be tarred and feathered."
"Teresa of Brewster, NY","Feb. 26, 2013",1,"I ordered Internet from Comcast on 2/11/2013. The equipment came on 2/15/2013. I installed everything; however, the Internet light did not come on. I spent 6 hours with them on the phone over the next 2 days, with their techs troubleshooting from a remote location. As this was clearly not efficient at solving the problem, I kept asking them to send out a tech to look at the problem. They kept telling me stories about how they couldn't find their appointment books (?). Finally, I got through to a supervisor who told me the earliest he could send someone was 2/26/2013. I asked if there would be a charge. He said no, since the issue must be on their end, after that exhaustive round of troubleshooting did not get results.On 2/25, I left work early to be there for the tech who was supposed to come between 3 and 5 pm. No one showed up. I found in my mailbox that they had already mailed me a bill, even though they had not provided me with any service. I called repeatedly; they kept saying the tech was on the way and that once the service was up, they could prorate the account. At 5:30 they apologized, told me my account would get a $20 credit for their failure to live up to the company guarantee because the tech never came. Later that night, they did get someone out, who again told me there would be no charge to me because the issue was behind the wall with wiring, which is something their company is supposed to take care of. He also left a huge hole in the wall, which my landlord will no doubt be charging me for.Today, 2/26, I called Comcast to get a prorate on my account. The account representative I spoke with, called Ed, who is in Massachusetts, did a complete bait and switch. He told me I would be charged $50 for the tech, and he would not prorate the account or honor the $20 credit that Marti had given me for the inconvenience of the tech not showing. Then he said he'd waive the tech fee. I kept telling him there should be no tech fee. The tech himself said it was on their end; it was not something a layperson would have known about. He said he could just leave the $50 charge on there then. I realized since he was not honoring the previous associatesŠ—È words and he would readily charge me $50 for something that was not my fault, I should just accept the waive of the $50 that I should not have been charged anyway. He remained steadfast in his refusal to prorate the account, and he would not give the $20 credit. It's not even worth it to call back and complain to someone else because honestly, this is how this company operates - so unfair, dishonest, and unethical."
"Linda of Maidens, VA","Feb. 25, 2013",1,"IŠ—Ève experienced loss of connection to internet/telephone service. All customer service is now in the Philippines. For over three weeks, I have spoken to 15 representatives and had one tech appointment. There is simply no one who can correct issues, credit account, take a complaint, resolve the connection issues or even cancel the service. I have been on hold, had representatives try to sell cable TV addition, and many lost call/hang-ups. We pay plenty for these services and yet we can get no assistance when needed. I further resent the recorded review which does not even inquire as to the problems you are having. I guess it is rocket science, and there is no customer service in this company or even retention of the business. I am seeking another company. Don't use Comcast unless you just crave irritation and incompetence! "
"Terri of Richmond, CA","Feb. 19, 2013",2,"Comcast installed (in our home) their Xfinity home phone and internet service in the week of February 4th. They told my husband and I that it would take about five days for our old phone number to port over from T-mobile to them (Comcast). Today is February 19th and we still have not gotten our old phone number ported over yet, but instead we have what Comcast calls a temporary phone number. Because they have not ported over our old home phone number, we cannot retrieve our phone messages from our old phone number. We would like our old phone number ported over as soon as possible."
"Anna  of Big Pine Key, FL","Feb. 19, 2013",1,"If you are a business owner, contact your merchant services provider before changing to Comcast. You will need an IP-compatible terminal. Comcast fails to inform merchants that their system is incompatible with most terminals. You may find out when you contact your merchant services provider with terminal connection issues or if you contact Comcast, they may send a technician on out, charge you $150, and then tell you that you need an IP-compatible terminal."
"jim  of Dowelltown, TN","Feb. 18, 2013",1,"Law and fact: Bait and switch is Illegal even for Comcast whether or not agreement is verbal or written since both are contracts and Comcast does record all conversations! As a person stuck with dial-up when cable net from Crookcast became available, I was accurately told the 1 year promo cost of $19.95 per month with an absolute cap of $39.95 per month with continuous service $19.95 short two months and cap was way off: the first of many lies! TV cable for basic premium was promised to never exceed $29.95 per month as long as I maintained continuous service: second big lie! Basic math: $40 + $30 = $70 plus tax and fees another $15 max for a total of $85! Surprise. Last bill is $112+ according to the Filipino customer rep. There is a call center in Nashville which is 65 miles from me so why was I routed half-way around the world!? Answer: This is a multi-year fight between Scumcast and me with many battles with Nashville's liars! Actions to take: Call Comcast Corporate in Philadelphia, PA at (215) 665-1700 and make it clear. You will talk to a corporate  problem resolutionist only or you will get a liar from a district call center like Nashville! No 215 area code on Caller ID state. I asked for someone from corporate only and I damn well better be called by one in 30 minutes or I will exercise all legal venues and if pushed to do it! The one and only legal venue is not the FCC!They are your State Attorney GeneralŠ—Ès Office (Elliot ** ate AT&T up for millions of dollar for what Comcast is Doing), the US FTC or US Federal Trade Commission (They got AT&T too!), and the US FCC or US Federal Communication Commission (and keep verbally complaining because even though AT&T was sanctioned by them also, they are, simply put, slow to act! Handicapped, disabled or persons over 50 can start with their Local Department of Human Services to launch their complaint of discrimination! Last thing I am going to write about is a class action lawsuit which with all the horror stories in here should be easy! Elliot ** beat AT&T into a PULP Defending the Citizens of NY in a huge class action lawsuit which politically benefited him (State AG's will help first) and it monetarily benefited New Yorkers to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars!

"George of Scranton, PA","Feb. 9, 2013",1,"After years without issue, this February, Comcast/Xfinity has entirely removed their data usage meter without informing customers.

"Andrea of Santa Rosa, CA","Feb. 6, 2013",1,"I opened a retail business and chose Comcast for my business bundle three years ago. The business had to be moved two more times during the three-year period. When I spoke with a representative each time, never once did any of them inform me it was a multi-year ""contract."" Most egregious (the last move a year ago), without my permission, they tacked on an additional three years and just buried it in the boiler plate of the contract. Why would anybody imagine they would do this without some verbal discussion? My serious mistake was that I trusted the company. My business failed as are so many in this terrible economy and when I tried to discontinue service, I was informed I signed the contract and that I am liable for two more years - to the tune of almost $3,000.After talking to several other business owners, I have learned that Comcast representatives do not verbally warn people of what they are putting in the fine print - knowing most people trust and do not read those multi-page contracts - and that is what they bank on. Entrapment. Comcast is horrendously unethical, sneaky and downright criminal in their behavior and policy. These policies should be verbally relayed to potential customers so that they can make a rational decision. No business can guarantee they will be in business for several years. Had I known what they were doing, I never would have signed up."
"Angie  of Winston, GA","Jan. 17, 2013",1,"I called Comcast to schedule an appointment for a tech to come out and install wireless Internet for my parents. The service rep stated a one-time flat fee of $25 on the bill would be applied. The day the technician showed up, he said there was a $49.95 charge for installation of WiFi - I said we were not told that when I placed the order. He said that most people are not told. Well, what can you do? We needed the service so we said okay. He was there 4 hours and changed out 2 modems - we had WiFi but only in a few rooms and then the cable was knocked out in two bedrooms.My mother who is retired and on a fixed income called Comcast to ask about the fees and she was given an 800 number where she did have her call answered by someone outside the US. She was frustrated that no one would help her. So I called them and I also was sent to a number and the lady said she was in Asia. I said, ""Where are you?"" She said, ""the Philippines."" I said, ""How do I reach a main office in Atlanta?"" She said, ""Well, let me transfer you and see where you wind up.""I got connected to a lady in Tennessee and she couldn't give me a local office or email address and told me to go back to the store where you turn in equipment and lodge a formal complaint. So I went to the local Douglasville office and she said, ""We don't have complaint forms,"" but that she would email her boss. This lady was the first person I had talked to in 3 days that even cared. It was a relief.How can Comcast offer services and not disclose all fees at the time you place an order? It has been 3 days and order was not complete and nobody cared. I was given the customer service rep's codes or IS numbers so if I can find where I can actually file a complaint in the United States, I would love to. Why do we get transferred to a number that is out of our country and they have all our information? Our home number, social security number, address? This is the poorest of service and I am saddened that my 70-year-old parents had to go through this experience. And we wonder why we have no jobs available to us?How does the FCC (or whoever regulates) or rather why do they let a company route service calls or questions to another country? How does that help me here in Georgia? It doesn't."
"Cheryl of Chicago, IL","Jan. 17, 2013",1,"I would like to receive a bill each month. This seemed to be very difficult for Comcast to do. I supposedly have a credit of $396.80 (according to the internet), $396.38 (according to their recording on the phone) and every month, I have to call and request my bill showing how much they are charging me and what credit I still have. I think that most customers do not pay attention to their bills and are charged randomly. Last month my bill was $158.69. This month was supposedly $161? They can't tell me why or what went up and have not yet sent me a bill. Why is this?"

Are they kidding? Comcast is now more than our NJ car insurance per year, for 2 cars with full coverage. Figure it out. It's over $2,000 per year for cable service! If we watch 4 hours of TV a day, it's a lot. Pricing should be paid per use. Yeah, I'm angry but what can I do? They are the only ISP in the area. What happened with cable deregulation? Was that not supposed to force competition? No, Comcast has the market sewn up. Oh and ask why I need 20 sports channels? We can't customize service yet. Ha, now that is a downright lie. So, I contacted Comcast and they can only offer a $10 monthly reduction for 1 year. Yes, you heard it folks, a whopping $10 bucks! Well, that just brought the cost down to what it was before the increase. Yippee! I am fed up with being tied up by a self serving ISP. FiOS is not available and Dish isn't much better. If anyone is as angry as I am, I urge you to write to your local government agency among others, as I am. One site is GovSpot.com."
"Sydney of Chesterton, IN","Jan. 15, 2013",1,"I ordered a modem through Comcast website under a rebate offer. I found it to be quite misleading. When I wanted to return the modem that had not been opened, I was told I would be charged for their shipping charges, plus 20%. I thought the equipment was under Comcast, since I ordered it on the Comcast website. It turns out to be a third party company. I was not sent a receipt from the company. I did not see anything about their expensive return policy. Comcast was not helpful when I called for help. I will cancel Comcast service as I am not happy with their customer service. I tried to call several times before I got through, and the hold time is over 20 minutes. It took me 46 minutes to make a call to Comcast. In the past, I had have good experience with Comcast. I just don't understand why this time, it is very unhelpful. I am looking for an Internet provider that is excellent in customer service, in both the services offered as well as any product they sell. It's very upsetting dealing with companies that don't care or respect their customers."
"Casey of Houston, TX","Jan. 15, 2013",1,"In June 2012, I ordered Comcast ""internet plus cable TV"" package for $36 a month with tax for 6 months. After the first two months, I still didn't have a working cable. I was told my cable box most be broken and they sent me another by mail with return shipping for the one I had already. I was told that my box wouldn't arrive until after the Olympic Games had finished. The Comcast representative then told me they would give me a free 10-day upgrade so I could stream the Olympics to my computer over my high speed internet. After the Olympics, I called to make sure my service was returned and to try and get my cable TV working. They sent over a technician who diagnosed a bad cable box. He tried to then connect the second box I was sent in the mail. Again he diagnosed this box as being faulty. He gave me a box from his van and I finally had working internet and cable TV.The next month, my credit card bill was $160 from Comcast. When I called, they said my service was upgraded to premium or something and the monthly charges were $109. They also charged me for the technician who came out to fix my cable box. I explained that I never upgraded my service as they described and I was never told it would cost anything other than free. I also explained that the technician had to replace my broken cable box and that there is no way that could have been my fault. They refused to drop either the increased monthly rate or the technician visit. I canceled my service immediately to stop the reoccurring $109 monthly fee. My total bill from Comcast was $266 starting from the time they changed my service and started the increased billing rate.I called numerous times and did live chat at which point the Comcast representative always put me in for a refund as they agreed the charges were incorrect. I also went to my local Comcast store and, again, they agreed the charges were incorrect and put in for a refund. Every time, Comcast's Financial department denied the requests for a refund. I contacted my credit card company that Comcast had auto charged the money. I explained the problems and they requested my information and Comcast's. After reviewing the charges, they concluded that Comcast could not validate the charges and refunded the money. The credit card company's statement said that Comcast agreed the charges were incorrect.I am now receiving calls from a collection agency out of Boston for $266 that they say are from Comcast. I called Comcast and they said not to worry and to work it out with this agency. They have refused to help or negotiate the charges as it's out of their system. I now have a collection agency bothering me and my credit score will suffer."
"Vicki of Derby, CT","Jan. 13, 2013",1,"On the online email website for Comcast.net, Comcast creates (or allows) continuous flashing brightly-colored icons in basic shapes like squares or stars to blink on and off continuously. These shapes are large enough to be headache-inducing and profoundly aggravating. Undoubtedly the colors and continuous flashing are tested first on human beings to find the combination which sends rockets of pain into the temple. This is not normal advertising. And when you click on the advertising link to get rid of the flashing symbol, hoping to get at least a temporary reprieve of 10 or so minutes, you get the ad (of course). But when you go back to the email site, the flashing is still continuous. I am paying over $70 per month just for Comcast internet service. And while I understand that advertising is part of the game, why must I also pay for aggravation and a headache (which I actually still have as I write this). Really! I am paying for a service which assaults me."
"Timothy  of Olympia, WA","Jan. 13, 2013",1,"I am writing to let you know of unethical business practices by Comcast. As far as I know, Comcast holds a monopoly at my address as Comcast is apparently the only high speed internet service available to me at my Olympia address. On December 15, 2012, my internet service quit working. I called Comcast to report the outage or malfunction. I was put on hold for probably the better part of an hour. Eventually, my call was transferred. After transfer, I was offered a service for under $10.00 (it was either $9.95 or $9.99, but I can't remember which). I was told that it would be a one-time charge and that if I agreed to pay nearly $10.00, they could fix the problem - which according to them was my problem, not Comcast's. I was impressed with the fact that the agents on the phone seemed incompetent and incapable of listening to me to find out the description of the problem. They put me on hold again. I was impressed with what appeared to be their method of guessing what the problem might be and guessing how it might be fixed. I'm a good guesser too, so I wasn't too sure that I wanted to pay them almost $10.00 to do what I could do equally well myself, but I was in a state of disbelief at that moment because I thought that rationally they should know what they are doing. While I was on hold, I fixed the problem myself. When the agent came back on the line, I said never mind. I didn't need their help and I didn't want to go back on hold again. They said okay. We hung up.Later, I received a letter from Comcast captioned: Welcome to Xfinity Signature Support. This looked suspicious to me, as if I were signed up from something I didn't want. So I called Comcast on December 26, 2012 to inquire and to make sure I wasn't going to get billed. I was put on hold for more than an hour. When an agent finally came on the line, she told me that the charge would be removed and that the subscription would be cancelled. I thanked her and I hung up. On January 11, 2013, the monthly bill from Comcast arrived. There was a charge of $39.00 for an item described as enrollment fee with a sub-line as follows: Wireless Networking and Computer Performance. I called Comcast about the charge at 2:30PM on January 12, 2013. I was put on hold. I was on hold for more than an hour until 3:38PM, when the battery on my cordless phone died. On the same day, at 4:10PM, I called again. I was put on hold. At 6:35PM, the phone died when the battery expired. I never spoke with anyone. The charge on my bill is fraudulent. I never asked for the service, was never informed of the charge, and never agreed to it. The only thing I was ever informed of was a one time charge of less than $10.00, but the agents who provided the service appeared to be incompetent. All they ever did for me was keep me on hold. I told them never mind and that I didn't want their help after all, and they said okay. I thought that I might nevertheless get scammed out of $10.00, but I am very surprised to see a bill for $39.00. I would proudly discontinue any business relationship with Comcast, but as I said initially, as far as I know Comcast is the only business that provides high speed internet at my address in Olympia. I would proudly drop out and refuse to subscribe to any internet, cable television or telephone services, but the fact is that I need internet for more than mere amusement. But there's only one high speed internet provider, Comcast, who rips me off. Please help."
"Connie of Perry, FL","Jan. 2, 2013",1,"We have Comcast internet service. Recently we have been having problems with the internet service not working, so after calling tech support, it was decided a technician needed to make a house call. He came in and replaced the modem with a newer version - the internet worked. Within a couple of days, we had the same problem. Another technician came out and yet a newer version of the modem was connected. However, the technician left stating he still wasn't sure it would fix our problem as he didn't really know what was wrong with our system.Adding insult to injury, when we received our bill a $30 service fee was added for the house call. My husband said he absolutely wouldn't pay it. I have a friend who had just gone through this same scenario and she too was charged the service fee (but then changed over to another internet carrier). I couldn't help but wonder if it isn't some scam on Comcast's part to clip people for service fees. I know too many people who have had the same problem."
"Darlene  of Palo Alto, CA","Dec. 28, 2012",1,"Comcast should be shut down because of criminal practices. Comcast never installed the correct equipment needed for us to access the services we are paying for. This has been going on for half a year. We are paying $159.99 each month, and our problems still are not resolved. This company has a monopoly, and they know it."
Loy of NJ,"Dec. 22, 2012",1,"Post hurricane Sandy service interruption for a week. Comcast laid a Coaxial cable from the cable box into our apartment temporarily, indicating that main line underground/through the walls are corrupt. Root cause was never fixed by Comcast and resulted in it being cut off by apartment management 3 days back. Reason stated: Trip hazard to neighbors and violation of policy in running cables over the sidewalk.I scheduled an appointment with Comcast for yesterday, 12/20/2012 (2:00pm-6:00pm slot). I was a block away from home, when Comcast reached my home. I did tell customer care to wait for me 5 more minutes. But within 5 minutes, the technician went away. I made four calls yesterday to customer care at different intervals, only to be told that the dispatch unit will re-send the technician. At the end of the day (6:00 pm), I again called Comcast, only to be told that technician will not be coming over. I had to reschedule the appointment for today, 12/21/2012 (9:00 am-1:00 pm slot). Since I had to ** from work yesterday, I made my spouse to be at home today (she took an off day from work today).Technician arrived at 9:30 am and my spouse explained the issue. He was unwilling to do any remediation and was rude with my wife. I was able to hear all conversation over the phone. I felt helpless and sad for my wife. I asked her to speak with his supervisor so to remediate the issue. Earlier, the technicians used to call up their supervisors and seek inputs. This technician did not heed to that request and simply walked to his Comcast vehicle and drove away. This is despite my wife pleading and requesting him to provide some help in reinstating Comcast service.I am deeply saddened and angry with such deplorable and inhumane approach that Comcast has, especially to a woman at home. I strongly feel this is racial discrimination and denial of consumer rights on a paid service. I would like to explore all options to take this forward if needed legally. As a formal step, I have lodged complaint with Comcast customer care. I am not sure if Comcast will be of any help in resolving the issue immediately. The apartment management clearly mentions that it's the responsibility of cable company to provide maintenance service to its customers. It also mentions that Comcast never made any attempt to reach out to the apartment management to resolve the issue."
"Matias of Mountain View, CA","Dec. 18, 2012",1,"Internet service is intermittent and slow. I've been having extremely unstable internet the last few weeks, with a lot of cuts and very slow speeds. I contacted the customer service 2 times with absolutely no solution and no other answer than ""It's your fault. We see everything is fine on our side."""
"John of Westminster, CO","Dec. 13, 2012",1,"Tech Support has been telling me that the problem is with my hardware, browser or settings. I explained to them that it doesn't matter whether I use my work laptop while I'm working or desktop at home or an iPad. The computers have different browsers. All cookies and cache have been cleared, so those excuses are invalid as are all the other ones they keep telling me. I explained that co-workers and people outside of my company are all having the same problem with their Comcast email but this info doesn't seem to make any difference."
"Ben of Sycamore, IL","Nov. 24, 2012",1,"We pay $69.95/month for 20 Mbps Internet. We average 2-6 Mbps. We get calls all the time where the salesman from Comcast tells us he's going to send someone out with a cable box and sign us up for cable at the low rate of whatever. And we usually have to hang up on them because they don't take no for an answer. Before signing up with Comcast, be aware of what you're getting into and use someone else if you (unlike us) have the option."
"Peter of Amherst, NH","Nov. 13, 2012",1,I called to get help with an internet modem wireless signal loss. Comcast placed a wireless modem in my house for me. We are constantly losing wireless signal. I called to find out what to do and was told that I had to pay to talk with a technical expert. I pay $150.00 per month for service and they want me to pay to talk to a technician. I asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor called me back and was extremely rude and made veiled threats about disconnecting my service. I hung up on the supervisor. This was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The issue is still unresolved.
"Andrea of Greenville, KY","Nov. 6, 2012",1,"I have spent nearly a year attempting to resolve service issues with Comcast. I have called customer service dozens of times, had technicians come to my home at least 7 times and even filed a complaint with the BBB - All with no resolution. My transfer speeds are a fraction of what they should be. I run a business from my home and often find my self unable to transfer the client files needed to do my job. I have replaced my modem (numerous times), router and even my computer. The lines in my home were replaced in 2009 and were deemed ""perfect"" by a technician. All the technicians assured me that my equipment is not at fault and that there is a problem with the lines. However, they leave here promising to escalate the issue. Then when I call to check the status, I'm told that the ticket was closed and there was no escalation.Every time I call Comcast, I am forced to start from the beginning explaining the issue. None of the phone reps are willing to look at the notes on my account from all my previous calls. I have heard over and over that my area is experiencing a ""stage two outage"" - one that apparently never ends. I have been told that I should rub the coaxial cable on my shirt ""to get static out of the lines."" I have been told that all 4 of my computers are broken, that my brand new modem is broken. Any excuse you can imagine, I've heard.I just need my service to work properly. As I said, I run a business from my home and I'm often unable to work. I am paying for a service that only works intermittently and cannot get any answers about the problem. Trying to get in touch with anyone from Comcast regarding this issue just results in being transferred from person to person, followed by yet another technician who visits my home, scratches his head and closes the ticket without doing anything to fix the problem."
"Jack of Somerville, MA","Oct. 28, 2012",1,"The actual download speeds to our house at **, Somerville, MA are consistently around 2.5 mbps as measured by the FCC's speed test. Comcast's speed test consistently returns a download speed of 12 mbps. The FCC's numbers confer the dead in the water download speeds we experience. You are not delivering anything close to rates your plans are sold at. I'm tired of complaining and will be starting two class action suits against Comcast if you don't start delivering on your commitments and stop falsifying your speed test results."
"Susan of Yelm, WA","Oct. 16, 2012",1,"I have had numerous problems with Comcast. The agents seem to be dumbfounded when I call or go online to request basic information. I have had to deal with inaccurate billing, incorrect information about my account, (i.e., wrong Social Security number, return of equipment, numerous attempts to set up a home phone and the repeated phone calls to verify the e911 portion where I get to speak with agents in India, whose second language is apparently basic English). It seems as though the agents do not seem to have the same knowledge of the services offered. Lastly, please do not get me started on the very poor online chat or customer service access. At one point, I was connected to four different agents who each asked for the same information 4 times. It was maddening, to say the least.Monopoly - I thought Microsoft was sued for such activity? What the heck is the difference between them and Comcast Internet Services? DirecTV desperately needs to get internet and phone services."
"Peter of Dallas, GA","Oct. 12, 2012",1,"Comcast is a joke! I can't get on the internet. I called them and they told me I had to switch to Firefox. I tried it - no better. I told them their lack of software or hardware on their end does not mean I have to be used as an experiment. I dropped AT&T for the same reason. So my next step is writing the FCC, and maybe we can get them on the Nightly News to answer all the complaints. I'm sick and tired of all this!"
"harvey of Atlanta, GA","Oct. 10, 2012",1,"They fix nothing. The online chat people are as clueless as those you speak to. I have no internet. The answer from these clowns is ""You have no internet connection, must be your equipment."" They read from a text and have no idea what they're doing. Now the clueless technician is coming, if he shows up on time or at all. I hate this company as most people do. Virtual monopolies should not exist. The worst company in America."
"Edward of Richmond, VA","Oct. 8, 2012",1,"If you want a truly dissatisfying experience, get internet service from Comcast. My service was out 24 days in August and they came out to my location four times. Each time, the internet would work for a brief period then go back out. It got so frustrating being on eternal hold while you waited to get through to a supervisor that I gave up. Fortunately, my T-Mobile phone service had hotspot capabilities, so I was able to use my tablet to surf the internet and do my reports for work. On the third time they came out to my location, my wife was home and the guy told her the cable to the entire neighborhood was out when in fact he was too big to access the crawl space. So, he told her he would call it in on Tuesday when he returned to work. Mind you, it was Saturday afternoon. It's a technology company. Why would it take so many days to report the problem? I called Monday and put in another service call and the same technician came back. Rather than lie to me and tell me the crawl space was too small for his rotund self, he ran another cable on the outside of my house. Now I have a cable sticking out of the siding at my front door. He also had another technician come over to supposedly help him with the install when in fact they were just running their mouths. The cable went out again and I called to speak with a supervisor and was on the phone for over 1 hour with no resolve, just a bunch of promises to be called back. My uncle died that Friday and I went to NY for the funeral. They called me while I was in NYC walking into the funeral home, so I cancelled the appointment and asked to just reschedule it for a later date and never heard anything from them again. For the next two weeks, I used the internet on my phone and said to hell with Comcast. I then had three deaths all on Sept. 14, 2012 and just let the internet go to the wayside. I finally had the time and mentally capacity to deal with them again so I called today, October 8, to pay my bill and ask for credit for the month of August for which I had no service. After paying the bill, the representative was extremely rude and told me they only offer credit for the days between when you call and the day they come out. My service is still intermittent, but I don't have the patience to deal with them anymore. I'm going to find another provider and hope that they are a little more professional than Comcast. They should record every call they get and give the customer a reference number for the call at the beginning, so that when the customer has a complaint, they can submit the reference number for that call. The representatives as well as the customers can be held accountable for what was said. Without some form of accountability, this will go on and on because they may be the only reasonably priced providers in that particular area. For now, I am stuck but I am diligently looking for another provider. Who cares if you come out within two days of calling if the problem is not ultimately resolved? Be professional and take pride in what you do. Know your job and if you don't have the answers, at least know the resource where you can get the answers from."
"Candy of Manitowoc, WI","Oct. 7, 2012",2,"I had no internet connection due to an outage in our area. I called Comcast to establish a new connection. They gave minimal internet connection, referred me to Signature Support as they did not fix this issue, and charged me $39.95. I called to cancel twice within 24 hours and twice after 24 hours. They refused to give me a confirmation number for my cancellation. Comcast is the ISP and is responsible for my having an internet connection, yet they tried to bill me when this all stemmed from their initial outage."
"Tim of Memphis, TN","Sept. 30, 2012",1,"We pay for Comcast's fast internet and expect and usually get upload speeds around 5Mbps and download speeds around 15Mbps or faster. But for days at a time using speedtest.net, we can document that download speeds are throttled back to less than 3Mbps while the upload speeds never change. I haven't changed anything on my side, and my home network computer speeds remain the same. I have over 30 years as a computer user and programmer, down to the bit level, and I am not unfamiliar with setting up and running networks. Of course, when you call or email Comcast, they suggest it's your fault - clear your browser history and cache, you have a virus, your router's not working right, on and on - all of which can be easily disproved. So, I have to think they are either dumb or purposefully dishonest, maybe both. Comcast's 'solution' is to keep doing the same things over and over (e.g., sending a technician out to my home when the problem is clearly outside my home) but without ever solving the problems. Unfortunately, we have no competition except relatively slow DSL via the phone lines, and the lines here are so noisy that it won't support DSL half the time. How I wish we could have some real competition among ISPs. All I can do is continue to squawk at Comcast and hope it irritates them enough that they actually try to fix the problems."
"Tom of Sugar Land, TX","Sept. 26, 2012",1,"I had internet connection problems for several weeks. After many calls, Comcast finally sent out a serviceman. They found out that the problem was at their box due to a loose connection. They sent me a bill for $51.00 service fee even though I pay more than $200.00 per month for their service. Comcast is a disrespectful company. Stop using Comcast. Their customer service stinks."
"June of Bensalem, PA","Sept. 18, 2012",1,"I tried to get hold of Comcast installation department and went through CSR and supervisor but to no avail. They do not have any info in regards the installation crew nor do they have a telephone number and/or an email. I had a Comcast technician climb my 6-1/2 ft. fence (because the gate was locked and I was home at the time and no one tried to let me know that they needed to get into the back yard). Also, the access to the poles that were needed was on another property and not mine. I do not have Comcast so I was pretty upset as there is a reason for the locked gate; we have a pool and also two dogs (good thing they were not out at the time). He was there with another technician who eventually knocked on the door (I think) as I didn't hear him.The dogs let me know and when I confronted him about his partner already being in the yard and how he got into the yard, he said he didn't know. Needless to say, they took down my birdhouses and did not put them back up. I had a doctorŠ—Ès appointment. My husband who came home to take me opened the gate for them and advised them that they could be charged with trespassing, unlocked the gate and told them not to do it again. But this was the 2nd time that I had a confrontation with Comcast. A month ago, another technician proceeded to let himself in our yard and when confronted, he told me that if I cut my bushes, there would be no need for him to come into my yard. Needless to say, the bushes belonged to the neighbor whose cable he was working on. My daughter had a problem also. Her neighbor had cable installed and they went right through the middle of her yard instead of the right of way and needless to say, the neighbor had a problem when they needed to run a tiller on their yard for tree stumps. Rest assured Comcast did use the legal right of way when they had to replace the chopped up cable. You would think that a company as large as this company would have something on their website pointing to complaints."
"Lewis of Paducah Ky, KY","Sept. 15, 2012",1,"Our home burned last year. When we moved back home, I called Comcast. They came out to install and dropped the box on our new wood floor. We made the guy fill out a report. We took it to Comcast and had the floor company come out and do the repairs to the floor. We have made many trips trying to get paid back what we had to pay for the repairs. It has been almost a year and they have not paid. Then we got our first bill. There were all these charges we never even knew what they were, DVR, huh? We do not have DVR and don't want one so they took the charges off. They also overcharged us for internet. We called and fixed that also. We had a lot happen. My mom got very sick and we had to take care of her. She passed away in May this year and we had to take care of all her things also. We did not get a bill last month. We got the bill today and guess what? Hmm, there it is, all the old charges we asked to have taken off and more. We went back and looked at our bill and they have been charging us for DVR and high speed and we had so much going on that we did not know it. Wow, I wonder who ordered it. I hope everyone looks at their bill very closely and call them monthly because they will try and rip you off. Look closely. Also, they do not have $19.99 Internet. When I call and say that is what it says online, they will tell you that is not offered any more. It is $27.99. Also, they will overcharge you. So please look at your bill. "
"Ken of Downers Grove, IL","Sept. 2, 2012",1,"There were frequent outages of several hours or more by throttle of bandwidth to almost zero. At an average of once every week, it happens in the 4 pm to 7 pm range. Customer service is clueless and/or blames the modem which I own. I have a great deal of knowledge in telecommunications, having worked in it for many years. It's not the modem - it's Comcast. Upload speeds are not affected, only download speeds. This is intentional and it has to be stopped. I pay for 20Mb/sec and they throttle it down to zero. Not 15, not 12, not 6, but zero. I can receive email only and cannot view YouTube videos or even go to normal websites. It is targeted and punitive against me."
"Scot of Apple Valley, CA","Aug. 31, 2012",1,"My son mailed ComcastŠ—Ès equipment to Comcast when he canceled his service. The equipment came to our home because this is his mailing address. I spoke to a customer representative and was told to mail (US Postal mail) to Illinois, and the equipment was refused. This is clearly stamped on the box that Comcast refused to accept the return of the equipment. My son is still receiving harassing phone calls about the equipment and money he owes for unpaid service. Comcast clearly is not allowing my son to cancel his service and return his equipment. Consequently, this is now in collections!"
"Wan of Sacramento, CA","Aug. 24, 2012",1,"For the past 16 days, we have attempted to obtain internet service from Comcast. During this time, we have been to the Comcast office one time, chatted with customer service 5 times, techs have come to the house 6 times, and they just completely did not show for appointment 3 times. Apparently, O. C. Communications is the contractor Comcast is using in California and they, very obviously, cannot scale to effectively perform the workload of Comcast, as evidenced by their obvious state of severe disarray. Inept, arrogant, and contemptuous are all good descriptive terms. Craigslist frequently contains a long list of open positions listed by O.C. Communications. You can tell the O. C. Communications people hate their job because most of the time there is some excuse for not performing the work or they just donŠ—Èt show up at all. There also seems to be a major disconnect in communications both between Comcast and O. C. Communications, plus a more severe communication problem within O. C. Communications. The company names should be changed to CantCast and O. C. MisCommunications."
"Robert of Henrico, VA","Aug. 21, 2012",1,"I moved and notified Comcast. I turned in my equipment to a Comcast center. I was told I did all I had to do. A month later, I received a bill for Xfinity signature support. I explained to 7 different Comcast people that I cannot have the service for my computer if I do not have Comcast service. They agreed. However, since one division of Comcast does not communicate with the other, I had to pay for a service that they could not provide and did not tell me I had to call direct to cancel. I believe that Comcast is committing fraud. They charge for a service they agree they cannot provide. The year-long experience with Comcast was terrible. The installation was terrible. Service person was rude and did not care. The company needs to revamp their telephone reps. They are not able to solve problems and are uninformed about the services that Comcast provides."
"Robert of Wilmington, de","Aug. 21, 2012",1,"Comcast is the worst internet provider I've ever encountered bar none!

Not to mention that most of the time, I have to start over with what I was doing because it's lost! They should be banned from continuing any internet service until they do what it takes to make sure that customers get what they are paying for and they provide what they promise! I intend on doing all I can to see that everybody will be warned of their incompetent service starting by filing complaints with the BBB and the CPA asap! I would suggest anyone going through this to do the same! You deserve and can get them to refund your money back! Just research that! I had to stop 4 times due to freeze ups just to complete this complaint! I'm surprised I got through it this time! Good luck!"
"Angela of Lock Haven, PA","Aug. 18, 2012",1,"I have had Comcast internet for one year, only because it has a monopoly in my area. It's the only internet service I can get besides dial up. We are paying extra for high speed that is rarely high speed. I thought I would save money by getting a home phone through Comcast. It was over $70 to install the phone, which took a total of 2 minutes. After 6 months, they raised my phone bill and I was being charged long distance for my mother's house in the same area code. I called to cancel the phone, and now they said my internet price will go up because I cancelled the phone. I had that price before I got the phone but now it's going up because I'm cancelling? This company is horrible and will screw you any way they can. I hope to God another internet provider comes to our area soon! If you can, avoid using Comcast by all means!"
"Olivia of Shoemakersville, PA","Aug. 16, 2012",1,"Where to begin. After having slow internet speed with Verizon in my husband and I's first home, we decided to transfer to Comcast. I believe this was the biggest mistake we could have made! We have had Comcast for a little over a month now. For some reason, all of the cable lines running to our home were cut, so Comcast had to fix the problem before we could get internet. In one week, we had scheduled for three different technicians to come to our home. Well, the first appointment was missed so we called that day after the scheduled time. We were told that they had cancelled our appointment and rescheduled it without telling us! So we waited about 3 days later for our second appointment. No one showed. We waited a couple hours past our appointment time and finally, someone showed. However, he was not doing what he was scheduled to do! We called Comcast and told them of our problem, that the technician did not know how the first appointment was missed and so he was working on preparing us for the third appointment instead of the second. They told us that they were at fault for not communicating to that technician. Finally, the third appointment day came and no one showed! We were so frustrated at this point that we called and spoke to the highest person up about what all has happened and demanded for their Comcast Customer Guarantee ($20 for each missed appointment). She said that $60 would be given to us and deducted from our bills. Being a little satisfied after that phone call, we waited about one more week until the last technician could come out and fix everyone's problems. This man was very disappointed with our service so far and therefore did more than what he was supposed to do and admitted that Comcast has horrible communication with their technicians. So for about two or three weeks, we had fantastic wireless internet speed until about a week and a half ago. Our internet speed has been incredibly slow. We have made several (9) phone calls to Comcast and every person reset our modem and told us that they do not know how else to help. Finally, we demanded for a technician to come out and check our end of everything. When he came out, he stayed for about an hour and a half checking to make sure that nothing wrong was coming from us. He checked both of our computers, our router and our modem. He even gave us a brand new modem for free just to ensure that nothing was wrong on our end! When he left, he stated that the IT department that Comcast works with created the problem and he sent in a ticket that would be corrected within the next 24 hours. Well, here we are 72 hours later with incredibly slow internet. For about a week and a half, we have had a download speed of between 0.08-0.26 (when we are paying for 24.0) and an upload speed of 4.5 (when we are paying for between 3-4). After the 24 hours was up, we called Comcast and were forwarded to the IT department, who was supposed to fix the problem they created. From India (where the IT department was based out of), we were told that they needed the right to charge us in order to discover where the problem is. I could have screamed! Both my husband and I had to talk to the IT department, who was very rude and inconsiderate. He said they saw the problem but the fact that we called him was because that we had the problem that they had to fix. We very politely told him that we were told that they created the problem and therefore we should not be charged for them to fix the problem that they created. After being interrupted many times from this man, we asked him to forward us to the highest possible person with Comcast. We were sent to the automatic voice when you call Comcast at the very beginning without the man saying a word to us before he left. We called one last time and they said that they would send out a technician, to do the same thing that was done 72 hours ago. Oh, and the $60 guaranteed by a higher up at Comcast and the Comcast Customer Guarantee was still never given to us - almost two months later. We cannot deal with this any longer, especially given that our college courses start in only four days! We won't even be able to download our class lectures with this horrible service. It is time to cancel service with Comcast now."
"Julie of Colorado Springs, CO","Aug. 10, 2012",1,"I was scheduled to work from home on Wednesday, 8/8/2012. The Comcast internet to my home stopped working (service outage) from 7:22 am to 3:01 pm. I was not able to work from home for 6.5 hours of the 7.5 hours I was scheduled to work. This cost me $286 in lost wages. Comcast gave me a $4 refund for my inconvenience. Our bill is over $200 a month. We are supposedly one of their (Comcast) most valued customers. You would think they could offer free service for one month or something a little better than $4! I am going to research another cable company."
"Rob of Thornton, CO","Aug. 9, 2012",1,"Comcast won't match competitors. I have tried now for several weeks to get a hold of someone at Comcast that would be able to price match my internet with CenturyLink high speed. After being transferred to multiple departments and offices, being disconnected and being given a fax number for a department instead of the real number, I decided I would try one last time to get someone that would take care of me. I have been a Comcast customer for 6 or 7 years now without any complaints. You would think that they would like to keep a loyal customer happy but that is not the case. I tried several months ago to get them to match a price with DirecTV and basically got the same runaround. They then seemed so surprised when I called to cancel their service. I wanted to keep their service but at $40 difference every month, why should I? It makes no sense to me. I am getting ready to step out the door and go to the store to pick up my CenturyLink modem and sign up with their service. I wonder if they think it is worth it to have a customer this disgruntled."
"Erik of Everettt, WA","Aug. 7, 2012",1,"So many things have gone wrong with Comcast that I will not explain them all but what made my family and I stop their service was this. We were only paying for internet because we had Hulu, Netflix, and Xbox for entertainment purposes. We were paying $70 a month for their fastest service provided. Since I live in an apartment building, I figured that the slow speeds were from the many people on the service. It was getting bad, Hulu would freeze and Netflix would freeze. Finally, I called them after 3 months of this going on. I was told that there was a bad signal in my apt. and that a tech would come out. So the tech came out and there is a box in our apt called Honeywell where he looks in and says there are some damages inside and he was surprised it did not send a signal to Comcast telling them that it was not working right. So he got on our laptop and fixed it and said, ""restart everything and all should be good."" Well after he left, he came back because he forgot his tool bag and to top that off after he was already gone, I found that my laptop was no longer receiving a wireless signal so I called Comcast and asked them what he did. They said in order to fix it, I would need to pay to speak to a tech that could assist me. I was **, this guy came to my home and he uninstalled my wireless card on my laptop and Comcast wanted me to pay for them to fix my mistake and they said for it to be free, we would have to wait 3 days for a tech to come take a look. Thank God 3 hours later, I found out how to reinstall it. I also was mad they did not want to fix it. So when I got my bill that next month, I thought that the tech might have put a note stating that I had not been getting the service I was paying for for 3 months but no, everything was still the same. After seeing my bill, I contacted customer support live on their website and after 15min. of me telling the person what was going on and I did save to my computer the whole chat log, he stated, ""We will refund you money from the point of when your service was interrupted."" So I'm thinking, ""great, I get 3 months pro rated"" but then the next bill came and they gave me a $20 discount. Their equipment was faulty and even the tech said he couldn't believe that the computers couldn't pick up this error sooner."
"Dennis of Sunnyvale, CA","Aug. 4, 2012",1,"Comcast discriminated against me by denying me internet access because I wouldn't take their Š—“bundle.Š— I only wanted XFINITY internet. My neighbors have XFINITY internet and cable TV with Comcast. I signed up for XFINITY internet on 6/23/12 and paid for the cable modem. Comcast reps strung me along for 3 weeks. I called repeatedly to set up service, but their reps kept telling me that a supervisor was reviewing my address and to call back in a couple of days. Over and over again we played this game until finally I was told they can't service my address. Funny, Comcast services all my neighbors. When I try to do a search for an ISP at my address, they all say Comcast is the only ISP that can service my address. On top of all this, while they were happy to sell me the cable modem, I was told I had to deal with the company that sent me the cable modem directly to get a refund. I didn't even know there was a different company to deal with. Comcast's reps refused to help me get my money back or allow me to speak with someone in the company that could help me. I eventually got my refund on the cable modem, but only after having to deal directly with some company in Tennessee or somewhere. Comcast's customer service has to be the worst I've ever come upon. No one from Comcast even attempted to contact me during the 3 weeks I was waiting to connect my service. I had to make numerous calls to them. On top of which, no one could answer my questions. I was told time and again that the supervisor who was reviewing my address was unavailable and I should call back next Monday or Tuesday, etc. Comcast's reps kept telling me to call back in two or three days and they would have the information for me. I thought I was going to have a stroke. I was so upset when they finally told me they couldn't service my address for internet."
"Roslyn of Greenwood, LA",41120,2,"I will take a moment to email, but after what we have been through this past week, this really is a waste of time. We had started two months ago to get a number ported from AT&T because we wanted to keep a business number that the company has used for almost 30 years. There were three attorneys in our office. The Senior Attorney, Mr. George ** was retiring and Mr. Richard ** and Mr. David ** wanted to keep the number. Mr. ** was told this process was completed last Monday, July 23, and we were waiting for Comcast to do their part.To much ado and many telephone calls to Comcast corporate office, Monday and Tuesday came and went with no Comcast assistance. Mr. ** had a vacation planned with family for quite some time and was scheduled to leave the office on Thursday, July 26, returning on August 2nd. Mr. ** had finally been assured by four corporate personnel that on Wednesday, July 25, between 11:00 and 1:00, the telephone and internet would be connected. We didn't see any Comcast technician between that time. Finally at 3:00PM, a third party technician showed up without proper tools and left. He told us he would return first thing the following morning to get this taken care of. We didn't see the technician the following morning, so I called him on the cell number he gave us. I was told that since the number was being ported, he would have to wait ten days. That was the first time this was mentioned to any of us. Earlier, I had mentioned this process had begun two months earlier and we were told the port was completed and Comcast could proceed. I spent the whole day on Thursday speaking to several contacts in your corporate offices to see when this would happen. I did receive a call on Thursday from Richard ** from your corporate offices and was told there would be a technician Friday morning from 9:00-11:00. I did call at 9:15 AM on Friday and spoke to Michelle ** or ** in your corporate office and she told me that there was still time. I actually was trying to get started early to be sure someone would show up. Well, 11:00 came and I finally called Richard ** again to let him know that no one had come out. He started to give me a story about why we didn't see the technician between 9:00 to 11:00 and I had said, ""Look, I really don't want an apology and don't want to hear it."" His manager, Brent or Brett called back and we were told something would be done on Friday. At 3:00PM on a Friday afternoon, when most people leave early for a weekend, the technician showed up. By this time, Mr. ** has left on Thursday for his vacation that I know he has not enjoyed because he has been on his cell phone constantly to check on updates. I did leave the office at 3:30 on Friday because I had already planned to leave early. While I was out of town on Saturday morning, I received a telephone call from Fernando ** to check on the telephone and internet status since he was out of the office on Friday. I told him we had gotten internet started, but not completed, but we really needed our telephones. He called me back 20 minutes later and told me there would be someone at our office at 8:00AM sharp. I told him someone would be there to meet them. I received a telephone call from one of the paralegals in the office at 9:15AM on Monday that the technician had not showed up. Finally at 10:00AM, a Comcast technician showed up. I just spoke with the paralegal and we still are not completed with internet. The technician hasn't even started on the telephones. I tried desperately to locate a telephone number for Brian L. Roberts, which I was told was the CEO, hoping I could get some help. I had left a message on a home number that I was able to locate from my internet at home but of course, no one answers the telephone. I did find a 215-286-8960 and spoke with someone about an hour ago and was told she was going to check into this today and get back with me. I have spoken to Richard ** along with his supervisor numerous times, Fernando ** numerous times, Undrea with your Corporate Escalation, Michelle ** or ** and would have certainly thought speaking with corporate personnel that are supposedly right under the CEO, one would hope would get some satisfaction. Another day is half over. We don't all have internet connections but most importantly, we don't have any phone service. Mr. ** left on vacation on Thursday without any communication with his clients or any new clients. We have had no communication whether it be by telephone or internet all last week from any new clients that would have tried to get in touch with him or Mr. **. I would have to say that this truly has been a nightmare. I would like someone to contact me regarding this matter at your earliest convenience."
"Rebecca of Aurora, CO",41115,1,"I've been having trouble with my Comcast internet service for several months, and I've called them repeatedly. My supposed high-speed internet service is slower than dial-up. Websites are constantly freezing and crashing my computer, and I couldn't stream a video without it freezing up for 10-15 minutes several times during a 40-minute show. Comcast said it was my fault, and they told me just reset my modem. When it got to the point where I was resetting my modem 20-30 times a day and I was still getting only intermittent, very slow connections, I called yet again. I was told to take my old modem in and get a new one. When I plugged in the brand new modem, it not only took out my internet connection, it killed my phone service. I had to take several trips back and forth to a pay phone begging them to do something. I had to wait until the next week before they'd send someone out. I waited all day and they never bothered to show up. I found out later, after another trip out to a pay phone, that they had called me and when I didn't answer my non-working phone, they decided to blow me off. So, they refused to come out and fix my non-functional phone service because my phone service doesn't work. It's unbelievable that anyone can be that stupid! I finally got someone to come out and replace the modem, and now I'm back to where I started. I have phone service back, but my connection is extremely slow to non-existent. Websites constantly freeze and crash, and I don't have enough connection speed to stream a video. They have been screwing me around for months, and they haven't done a freaking thing to fix the problem. All they've done is made it worse. And the customer reps act like it's a big hassle to actually take my call and do their job. They're smug, mouthy, insulting, and they act by turns bored and put upon. I've had it. There's yet another person supposed to come out tomorrow. If he doesn't show or doesn't fix it once and for all, I'm transferring my service to a different company. I've had Comcast for years, but they have really hit the skids. Lousy equipment, lousy service, and lousy attitude. I'm sick of Comcast. They suck."
"James of Jacksonville , fl",41103,1,"On April 25th, I was charged for two cable modems and two separate internet services. I contacted customer service on May 5th. The representative told me the problem would fix itself. Two weeks later, the issue wasn't resolved. I contacted customer service again and was told by the representative that he put the credit on my account. I logged on a few days later to discover that it was not applied. I contacted customer service and was told the credit was already applied, so I checked my records against Comcast and found that the credit was not applied. I contacted customer service a fourth time to be told that the credit would be put on the account. I told the rep that I keep getting the same response and it never gets done, so I would like to speak with a supervisor. I was placed on hold for 12 minutes. Afterwards, the rep said no supervisor was available. I told her to find one. The counter went to 55 minutes on my cell phone before I got a supervisor (I had to explain to her that if her supervisor was not available, then get the general manager. If they aren't available, then get the operations manager). In total, the call lasted 1 hour 7 minutes and 36 seconds, only to be told by the supervisor that they would put the credit on next month's bill. I am cutting my losses, paying my account down to a 0 balance and getting a different ISP. This was a $130 lesson learned."
"Christine of Roseville, CA",41100,2,"In February, after 6 months of our ""bundle"" bill going up each month, we called Comcast. The bill had reached $182 a month! My husband took great notes on everything. They offered us $139 a month for the first year and $159 the second year. We asked for a contract but they said they don't do that. Since then, each month, the bill has gone up. This month we reached $152. My husband called them and spoke with a supervisor who said they didn't care about our business and there was nothing he could do. He could not explain the extra charges. My husband asked how they could change the contract and he wouldn't answer the question. My husband then did a computer chat with customer service and felt much better. The man said there was a mistake and we would receive a call within 24-48 hours to correct it. That was four days ago and we have not received a call."
"Linda of Niles Michigan, MI",41092,1,"Eight months ago, I was dissatisfied with the internet service I had before. So I went searching for internet through Comcast as I already had my cable TV through them. I spoke with a woman and told her I was looking for a better deal for internet service, and asked what she could do for me. She told me about different plans. One was what is called Econo Internet Service, it sounded very reasonable. The installation would be spread out over 4 months on my bill. Then there after my payment would be $26.99 + $7.00 for the box rental total $33.99 a month. This month our bill came from Comcast and my husband was furious as our total bill with cable was $123.63. My husband has been out of work since January of this year. So we started to go over our cable bill and realized that for the last 3 months the internet was $36.95 and $35.30. So my husband called Comcast to talk about the problem with the price of the internet. Not only was it wrong, but the math for the internet part of billing was wrong. They informed my husband that that internet service we got from them was a promotional, which is an outright lie because I was the one (Linda **) who spoke with the representative for Comcast when I got the internet. And she informed me that she has this particular plan Econo Internet Service and was really pleased with it. At no time during our conversation discussing the price after installation was paid off that this was a promotional fee. And that it would have gone up. If she had, I would have declined to get it and searched elsewhere for a better deal. Because of my husband being unemployed at this time, money is almost non-existent and every penny counts. And one thing we have to have is the internet for him to search for work and keep applying every week for his unemployment benefits. So instead of canceling the internet for the time being, we had to change our cable TV programs to accommodate for the unfair practice in extorting more money from the consumers. Now I understand why Comcast is rated one of the ten worst companies. They deserve the title. But mark my word. As soon as my husband is employed again, I will kiss Comcast internet goodbye. I almost forgot they told my husband that this promotional was for 6 months. I am livid for them lying like that."
"Michelle  of Fort Wayne, IN",41087,1,"In March 2011, I joined a leads group from the Fort Wayne Chamber of Commerce. My sister and I were getting ready to open up a gift store in downtown Fort Wayne. A representative from Comcast was a member of that leads group. She talked to us about a great deal Comcast was offering at that time - $129 for 2 phone lines and internet service. Knowing we were going to need these services for our gift store, I told her I was interested and she gladly set everything up for me. She never once mentioned anything about a $300 installation fee or having to sign a three-year contract. She had me sign for the service.After the services were installed, I received a bill for over $400 and was shocked. I did pay the bill even though I was upset she never mentioned the installation fee. Today, June 27, 2012, I called to cancel the service since my sister and I are closing our gift store. That's when I was told I signed a three-year contract and I would have to pay a $2,000 fee to get out of the contract! I was beyond shocked! First of all, she never even mentioned that I was signing a three-year contract. I never would have signed a three-year contract because my lease was only for two-years!This Comcast representative never mentioned anything in regards to not being able to cancel this service at will. It's very deceptive and after reading the thousands of complaints, I'm not sure where to turn. A supervisor was supposed to call or email me but nothing. I want to nip this in the bud now before this turns into something that drags on for months. I don't trust them as far as I can throw them!"
"samianne of Middlebury, CT",41069,2,"Two years have passed and I still have not received my netbook promised to me for signing up. First, it was ""didn't pay bill on time."" When that turned out to be false, it was ""didn't sign a contract."" Bad, bad people."
"Kevin of Maplewood, MN",41068,2,"When choosing an internet provider, I liked the Comcast's price and the service. I spoke with a sales rep from the company, Lyn **, and she told me that the transfer process from Century Link would be ""seamless"" and our services will be down for a max. of about 5 min and that we would have to cancel our Century Link Internet (I have e-mail record). The tech came to switch our phone numbers and added cable internet. He looked at our system and said, ""I cannot touch that phone system"" (it is a POPP system). I was baffled because I informed Lyn that we had a POPP phone system. He informed me that we would need to hire a phone tech to work while another Comcast tech came. This cost us an additional $150 and totally wasted my day because I had cleared my afternoon to assist the tech. We had the phone tech come out and the Comcast tech (who was 10 mins late) and set up our phones and internet. All was fine. No problems other than the tech messed with my routers and killed our database for good. We have a domain name and we use the domain for our e-mail. I came to work on Monday after the switch and found out that we were still using Century Link internet servers for our e-mail. I thought, ""Great. I will pay for both services and switch the domain name from Century Link during the weekend when we will have no e-mails going through, thus making the switch seamless."" Well, to my surprise, when I came in to work on Wednesday, Comcast had suspended our services from Century Link (without our permission) and we had no e-mail server/service. I am in the sales business and no e-mail means no orders received. I called Comcast and they said, ""No problem. We will just add your domain to your account."" Great. He walked me through setting up the vanity domain name and then instructed me to go through our host server (**) and have them add our new, **, and target value. The process was supposed to take 24 hours, but could take up to 48. Not so great. After 24 hours, I called the Host to ask if all the information was ""propagated"" and the tech said, ""It should all have been sent sometime last night."" So, he said it is Comcast who was in error. The blame game begins. I call Comcast and they say that it has to be the Host who has not sent the information. After about 7 phone calls and 4 hours, I finally got a manager to talk to at Comcast, Jason out of the Denver office. He said he would call the host company and figure out what is going on and call me back in 2 hours. 2 hours came and went. I angrily went home. Now, it is day 3 (still with no e-mails) and the domain name is still ""provisioning."" I called Comcast and asked to speak to a different manager because Jason lied to me and never called me back (and the host said he never called them either). Now, I deal with the manager whose name is Dustin. He said that Jason had ""escalated"" the ticket to their Tier 2 techs yesterday and it will be 48 hours until I will get a response. I got upset because this issue has already been going on 48 hours and it would appear on my end that they have done nothing. I finally got Dustin to talk to our host (had to make a conference call) and Dustin said he would have his Tier 3 tech call them and figure out what is going on. He said I should receive a response in about 2 hours. I waited 2 and got a call from the Tier 3 tech, Kris (after 48 hours, you would think it would already be at Tier 3). He said it had something to do with Century Link not releasing the domain. He said he would work on it and give me a call back. I then called Century Link and asked if Comcast had called in regards to our account. They informed me that they had no record of receiving a call from Comcast regarding our domain name. Finally, Kris called me at about 3:30 and informed me that the problem was on their end and he didn't know why they would not propagate the domain name. He said he would have to send a message to the manager (I am assuming Dustin) to tell the other techs to ""get their ** in gear, "" basically saying it was Comcast's issue the whole time. So, to sum it all up, 3 days with no e-mail (we figured we lost about $1000 a day at least in orders), my staff who cannot do their job for three days (their job is e-mailing customers and receiving orders via e-mail) thus about another $500 in pay lost, and I made at least 20 phone calls to our host, Century Link and Comcast. When I spoke to Dustin regarding compensation due to the fact that Comcast did not do their job and also told us that the transition would be ""seamless,"" he said simply, ""we don't do that."" I am very unhappy with how the situation was handled by Comcast, how the sales associate lied to us and how the only thing anybody did was finger point on whose problem it was. Also, now I have to work overtime on the weekend to get our e-mail back on track (that is assuming they have fixed it by tomorrow morning). If I were to grade my Comcast experience so far, it would be an F for Fail."
"Sally of Richmond, VA",41067,1,"After moving from Richmond, VA, we were sent a prepaid label to return our computer router and wireless adapter. We mailed them in immediately after receiving the label. Luckily, I kept the receipt from UPS because approximately three weeks later, we received a collections notice. The notice told us that Comcast had contacted them in regards to us owing money for the equipment, stating it had never been returned. When I contacted Comcast, they admitted to submitting us to a collection agency without notifying us of any issue. They also looked up our records and found that they showed that we had, indeed, returned the equipment. I received no apologies and was told that it would take a week for the information to be removed from our account and for the collections agency to stop calling us/sending notices. I'm beyond livid at their mistake and lack of human compassion."
"HARRY of Jensen beach, fl",41063,1,"I called tech support on Thursday, 5/31/2012, to report my internet service out. The tech on the phone walked me through several troubleshooting steps but could not get the system running. He made an appointment for home repair for Saturday, June 2, 2012 between 1-3pm. I made it extremely clear to him that my home phone was also out due to no internet service. I told him the only phone they could reach me on was my cell phone. He understood and made a change of phone number on the work order. Saturday morning, I made a call to tech support to make sure they had the right phone number on the work order. The lady assured me that it was 3pm, Saturday. No service tech. I called tech support, talked to a Curt. He assured me that his tech was just late, be patient and he would be here. I also reminded him of the number to reach me. He said yes the tech had the right number. Curt also told me congratulations. Because the tech was late, Comcast was going to credit my account $20. How nice but guess what, no truck ever came. I called Comcast and got a recording saying our service was cancelled because the tech could not reach us. Guess what number they were calling, my home number that didnŠ—Èt work. Back on phone, I got a live woman from Georgia. She called me Mr. ** and told me she would solve my problem. She got me another appointment for Sunday, June 3, 2012 at 8-9 am. She positively assured that the problem was solved. She made it fool proof for the tech to call the wrong number. She even gave me another $20 and 6 months of HBO free. Sunday morning 9am, no service tech. You arenŠ—Èt surprised to hear that right. Does this Groundhog Day the movie called Comcast at 9am? The woman I spoke to said, oh I know what the problem is. The bad computer doesnŠ—Èt know that your home phone doesnŠ—Èt work. She said I will fix it. I will take that bad number out of the computer and enter my cell number. No more mistakes. The woman assured me I would hear from the tech within 3 hours to give me his arrival time. Eight hours later and guess what, no call, no service tech. I just canŠ—Èt believe that there are that many people employed at Comcast that donŠ—Èt remotely know how to order repair service or just donŠ—Èt care. The old 8 and skate crowd."
"Rajanarayanan of Dayton, NJ",41063,1,"Comcast Xfinity service is abysmal - I switched back to Comcast from Verizon after 3 years when the salesman promised that things are different now after they started with their Xfinity service. There were initial hiccups for sure when I considered opting out as they had the 30-day guarantee, but I stuck with it. It seemed to get a little better over time but then, the problem started with the phone service that most Xfinity triple play customers are now familiar with - you can hear the other party but they cannot hear you a few minutes into the call and you need to redial. Comcast has not been able to do anything about it. There were disruptions of internet service but except on a few days, it was alright. Yesterday (June 1, 2012), there was a major outage for 3 or 4 hours and when I called Comcast, they said the problem affected our area (Dayton, NJ) and technicians were working on it but could not give an ETA for resolution. The service did come back later but for the last 24+ hours, I've been having interruptions on phone service every few minutes when the line goes dead without a dial tone. The internet cuts off as well, and I have been recycling the modem every few minutes. I think Comcast does not have the wherewithal to run a huge data network and their technicians are the least knowledgeable in data networking. I am terribly mad and am thinking of switching out regardless of their termination fee. I rely on internet service for work. God knows how they are able to advertise high speed internet service for businesses when they are unable to deliver a decent service to households. I will never recommend their service - No internet and no phone service from Comcast - to anyone (except their TV)."
"Edward of Corryton, TN",41054,2,"Comcast is too big to care about its customers. I am paying every single month for 12Mbps download and 3Mbps upload. Yet, when doing several speed tests for Comcast Xfinity, my download speed ranged from 0.40Mbps to 1.81Mbps download and 0.58Mbps to 0.76Mbps upload. When I called and asked Comcast why it was so slow, the customer service lady said I could pay another $10 a month to upgrade to 12Mbps download and 5Mbps upload. I told her I was not even getting what I was paying for now, so why would I want to pay them more money for something I'm not even getting now?"
"Sadiq of Alexandria, VA",41050,1,"I wanted to get internet service from Comcast cable services. I checked myself the availability of the Comcast service at my address and got the answer online that the service is available. So the next day, I called on the number 877-417-0922. My call was, after some time, answered by a person who called himself Kenneth. After taking all my information, he told me that I will get internet service at $29.99 and a free router and modem. Then he said, ""you will pay for the two said devices and you will get the paid amount back as a rebate"". After this, he said ""you will have to pay for the shipment $19.99"". Then he said, ""you will not get the shipment amount back"". The total amount he made was $199.93. He took all my credit card information. There was not enough amount in my bank so I offered him another card and told him to get the total amount from the two cards. He told me that I will pay double shipment if I have to use two cards for payment. I did not want that so I rushed and deposited some cash in the bank to make the payment from one card. After making the payment, he started offering me more of his offers from AT&T security and tried to connect me to the AT&T security people. I told him that I have been on the phone for about two hours and I was late for my job, I will do that tomorrow. So then he connected me to the installation department to setup the date for installation. The man who talked to me from the installation department called himself Steve, told me that my computer shows that Comcast service is not available at my address. After too much discussion, he told me that I should cancel my order from the sales department. So I called back to the sales department and found on the phone a person called William. William told me that the installation department people may be confused and that we have the service in that area and connected me back to installation department. This time, I found another person called Espo. Espo said there is no service at my address. I tried to reach Kenneth, the first person whom I had talked and who had taken all my credit card information to cancel the deal, but I could not get to him. When I reached for my job, I was two hours late. At my job, my cell phone started ringing. I had told Kenneth that I am unable to pick any call when at my job. I tried to call back, but nobody picked my call. The next day, I got a message from my cell phone company that I have used all my minutes and I need to refill my account. The next day, I called the number 877-405-5035 and talked to a lady whose name was either Rem or Allisan. She told me that I still can get the rebate. She told me to fill the forms online and send it for rebate. The form for rebate was asking for the date of installation, but I haven't been given the date of installation by the Comcast people because they are not going to install the service to me. There is much more to say because I have talked to some other people in Comcast. Please do not do this. Please be truthful."
"toni of Galesburg, IL",41048,1,"I have had this service for two years and I have never been late on a payment. Last week, my Internet and cable went down eight times in one day the week before twice. Yesterday, it went out before noon and did not come back up until 7:00 pm and was done again this morning. I called them many times. Of course, it is a mess getting through since they have four numbers and no local number. They all insisted there was no outage and wanted me to go through all of that nonsense they have you do. I told the girl that I had already done this 15 times and yes it was an outage. I called back and a young man told me, ""Yes, there was an outage.""I called this morning and no outage. Yet, Comcast trucks were down the road because there was an outage. I work online, go to school online and lost money so I had to get a hotel just to get online. This is ridiculous and we are demanding something to be done here. Comcast has the monopoly on this small area so I am stuck with it."
"Michael of Paducah, KY",41046,1,"Incompetent service installation - Three months ago, I called to ask if I could split a cable to a second home on my property. I was told by Comcast that that would be considered theft because it was a separate address. Fair enough. An installer came to connect the other service, but used a two-way splitter at the pole dividing my signal with the other home. A line was laid on the ground across the driveway for a temporary connection. The new splitter was installed without the ground wire, leaving a lightning damage hazard. After several calls and missed appointments over several months, a service technician came to the property and disconnected my service, leaving the ungrounded temporary line still lying across the driveway. After 5 or 6 calls being promised a technician to come back out, and that a supervisor would be contacting me within 2 hours (promised 3 times, no call), I finally got to talk to a supervisor who scheduled a service call in two days, and a credit of $40.00 (slightly more than one week of service). Really! If I had connected a splitter, it would have been theft of service. When they did the same thing and billed both of us for full service, it was a minor inconvenience."
"Jeannie of Lebanon, PA",41039,1,"Roughly about a year ago, I wanted to try the 3G or 4G to go, so I signed a contract of a year with Comcast. I was very dissatisfied with the service. I mean, it was just terrible. I only attempted to use it about 6 to 7 times and every time I tried using it, it was very slow and it would freeze especially in the highway. So I went personally to the Comcast office around Christmas time to cancel the service, but I was told that if I canceled before the year of the contract that I agreed to, I would have to pay the full amount of whatever the device was worth. So I had no choice but to keep paying for the stupid service. So when the time was up, I went personally to the office to cancel the service for the 3G or 4G to go. Lo and behold, I was in for a surprise. The service that I was paying for was no longer available. The office worker had mentioned to me that it had been a while since Comcast had the service because of so many complaints. So I wanted to speak to a manager so that I could get a refund for paying for something that was no longer available through Comcast. I also learned that I had to return the device to Comcast even though I was faithfully paying for the service throughout the whole year. I will pursue further action if I don't get a response from Comcast or receive what is rightfully mine. I would like a manager to please call me asap. I'm not going to pay my bill until I get answers and the refund that I'm entitled to. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."
"Teresa of Brighton, MA",41038,1,"After seeing a promotion for $150 Visa Gift Card with bundled service, I decided to try Comcast. I was to have my service installed mid-October. The day before installation, I received a call from a rep telling me my installation needed to be rescheduled because there was no service contract on file. Without that, I could not receive my promotion. I was connected to a department where answers to their questions were recorded. It was a verbal agreement to a 2-year contract with them. I was told it would take 3 months to receive my gift card. When March arrived and I had not received my card, I called to inquire about it. I was told someone would get back to me. April came, and I called again. For the second time, I was told someone would get back to me. By the time May 2 came along, I was furious. I called and was told she personally would get back to me, which she did not. I called yet again on the 8th and the man gave me my word he would look further into this and he would personally call me before the day ended. Guess what? It never happened. This morning, I spoke to yet another rep. He put me on hold for a brief period of time and came back to tell me there was no contract on file. I insisted I did indeed have my conversation recorded for a verbal contract. Now he is looking into this, saying that without a contract, I could not qualify for the gift card. He gave me his number and extension and I am to call him in a week if no one gets back to me. I am beyond angry at this point. If they don't keep their word and send me my Visa card, they can take their service and shove it where the sun don't shine. I never had a problem with RCN. I should have stayed with them, but I will definitely be returning to them!"
"Dan of Houston, TX",41037,1,"I own a tattoo shop and recently bundled my internet with my phone service with Comcast. I run a credit card machine off our phone line. Since signing up with Comcast, our phone and internet have been down 4 times in as many weeks. We lose money each time by not having access to our credit card machine. I have spoken with Comcast on several occasions and have experienced the worst customer support ever. They seem totally incompetent. We have requested someone out to our site 3 times now and they send someone at 9 a.m. on Saturday each time although I have explained our hours over and over. This is the worst dealings I've ever had with a company."
"Jim of Cartersville, GA",41027,2,"I contacted Comcast by phone in mid-February to request that the overpayment be immediately deposited back to my bank account. The agent said that she would ensure that the request is logged in the system and forwarded to the right department to process, but it may take 6 weeks. I have called several times asking for the status. They have notes in the system reflecting the request, but can not give me a reason for the delay or better timing. I called last week (9+ weeks) and was told by the agent that she would escalate the request and someone would call me within 72 hours to help. Today, I went to the local Comcast office to cancel service and asked for my refund. The customer service agent said that she would email the refund department in Atlanta. I told her that I appreciated that, but considering the delay to this point, I would prefer that she calls. She told me that she did not have their number and has done all that she can do. I requested to speak with a supervisor, but was told that she is in Tennessee. I asked if we could call, but was told that she is on vacation. I asked how can we escalate this since I have made several attempts and have not received any follow through."
"Hoon of Beaverton, OR",41025,1,"On 10/27/2011, I called a number on the advertisement flyer which shows 3 Mbps service for $14.99 for first 6 months, then $24.99 for the next 6 months. I confirmed twice with the Comcast operator that it is indeed the correct speed and the price is correct. I signed up for the service. On 11/5/2011, when my service was installed, I noticed the speed is 1.5 Mbps, and not 3 Mbps. I called Comcast and spoke with operator ID **. I was told that there must have been an error, and they don't offer 3 Mbps for that price. So, I upgraded to a 3 Mbps service and was told the price is $19.99 for the first 6 months, then $29.99 for the next 6 months. I said fine.On 4/26/2012, it was time to pay the bill for the 7th month. I saw my bill and it was showing $62.95. I called Comcast and spoke with operator ID **. She said from the note, from 11/5/2011, I was offered a 12 Mbps service (not 3 Mbps) for $19.99 for only the first 6 months, with no mentioning about the next 6 months. I spoke with the supervisor, but he didn't help at all telling me that's what's on their conversation history note.They lied to me twice; once when I signed up, and the second time on the first date of service, when I called to complain about the speed and bumped up my plan. I have to pay $39.95 for the 3 Mbps if I want to continue using their service now."
"Nandasiri of Catonsville , MD",41024,1,"On Sunday, January 8, 2012, I spent about 3 hours on the phone trying to resolve a problem regarding our email - i.e. emails sent by one individual are sent back with an error message. Each time I called, the call would go to an outsourced country (Philippines, I believe) and three times I was given the runaround. On the fourth call, I was told by an individual that the call had come to a ""fee-based area"" of Comcast and that I had to pay upfront $49.00! I was shocked by this method of Comcast to collect money for a problem that has originated from Comcast. I vehemently declined to pay a cent. I tried another call, this time asked for the supervisor and the rep said the ""manager has gone home"". I told him call centers don't run without a supervisor. Well, I tried again (6th call) and this time, I asked again for a manager. I was told that the supervisor was on the phone, but he said the supervisor would call me back and asked for my USA number. From past experience, I told him that people in the foreign-located offices never call USA customers to settle a problem. He lied as I have so far not received a call. I am sure if I had spoken to a rep in the USA, this problem would have been resolved. I am frustrated and fed up with Comcast customer service. Who should I contact now?"
"David of Memphis, TN",41023,1,"Last March I opened a business internet account with a static IP with Comcast. The only reason that I needed a business account/static IP was that my wife needed it per her employer at the time. The situation was that I took a new job in Memphis and my wife moved with me from California. At the time, she was allowed by her California employer to work remotely but was told she would need a static IP in order to connect with the company network. The only way that Comcast will provide a static IP address is with a business account.A few months after moving here, my wife's employer decided that the long distance thing was not working out and my wife had to look for a new job. When this first happened, I contacted Comcast to see what my options were in regards to dropping the static IP and the commercial account, and switching over to a residential account for personal use only. I was told that they could drop the static IP without penalty but that I would be responsible for the full term of the business contract which was 36 months. When I first talked to Comcast in regards to opening this account, I was under the impression that the term was for one year which is all I would ever agree to, under the circumstances. When I signed the service order, I did not notice that it was for 36 months. I just checked the agreement real quick to ensure that the monthly charges were as agreed to and signed it. That was my mistake but at the time I was scrambling to get moved that I got a little careless. So, we did drop the static IP and I decided that I would just live with the higher commercial rate for my personal internet access. Now, we are moving from the apartment we live in to a duplex in another part of town where the landlord pays for internet access, so I need to cancel the service in its entirety. However, I am running into a brick wall. The customer service reps tell me that I will have to pay a penalty which amounts to $1318 which I cannot afford. I also do not believe that I am responsible for this either.I have read the Terms and Conditions which state that this penalty will be charged if the customer terminates service without cause. In the section regarding termination for cause, it lists termination of business as cause which I am positive my wife's situation qualifies for. So, I should be able to cancel without penalty. So it comes down to this. The original business needed for a static IP and thus a business account no longer exists. The need for any internet service is not required as I am moving and internet is provided at the new location. Based upon this, I believe that I should be able to disconnect without penalty."
"Jill of San Francisco, CA",41018,1,"Comcast's unwanted malware alert is the only malware on my computer. I've called (a 3-hour ordeal) and was met with pompous arrogance by a guy that claimed no supervisor was available and if there was, he'd tell me the same thing. I followed the instructions for removal to no avail and let him know this. Finally, he said he would remove this obstruction. Two days later, it's back. "
"Axel of San Jose, CA",41018,1,"My Comcast internet service is constantly cut or so slow it is impossible for me to load web pages. This does not allow me to accomplish any work that needs to be done at home, do any online gaming and forces me to work late nights at the office. Sometimes the service is as bad as not getting a signal at all. Whenever I call to ask about what could be wrong, they constantly try to blame the problem on my router or modem, both of which I replaced already the first time they told me to, or put me on hold for an unreasonably long amount of time. Then, when I called a technician to come over, he claims there is no problem and promptly goes to charge me $40 for coming over. Then when he leaves, I try to resume work and the internet connection gets cut again."
"Allison of Knoxville, TN",41017,1,"My phone service has been out since April 13 and my wireless is not working. I called on the evening of April 16 and the rep tried to send signals and it didn't work so he said we needed a service call and asked if Tuesday would work - I said no. He said, Š—“How about Wednesday?Š— I said yes, and he said Š—“Between 8-10am?Š— I said, Š—“Perfect. I take my child to school and will be home by 8:15.Š— He never gave me a date so of course I thought it's today - but no, it's next Wednesday, the 25th.I would have never agreed to wait a week and a day for the service call. So I have stayed home waiting for 2 hours this morning for nothing! Do the reps need to make sure and triple check with the customers on the date and time? Now I'm on a waitlist. I have to wait and hope a technician either gets a cancellation or gets some extra time, and will call me to see if it's a good time to come by. If not, I have to wait a week. I am not happy about this situation at all!"
"Elario of Bacliff, TX",41017,1,"I am a new customer and I only ordered internet Xfinity. I was told of all the charges and then today, I get my first bill and they have added a reconnect fee, which I was never told about. I was told there was no installation fee because I was a new customer. I called and, of course, they dance around what I was told and tell me I have to pay the installation fee. This is so unfair and sad that a company as large as Comcast would play these games to get a customer to sign up and then they screw you over with added fees. What happened to honesty and giving a customer what you promised? The guy that came to install the internet couldn't even help me setup my computer because he does not know the Apple computer. I had to pay someone else to come setup my computer. The installer didn't give me a so called welcome package and didn't do anything but connect from the outside. Now, letŠ—Ès be fair. Should I have to pay for services that the installer had no knowledge of setting up my Apple laptop? Until today, 2 weeks later, I still don't have a Comcast email address."
"don of Jacksonville, FL",41016,1,I have signed up for auto-pay but they are not billing my payment method. I have attempted to use my credit card to submit payment online but it fails every time. This is not a problem with my credit card. I've checked with the credit card company. This problem has persisted for over 6 months. No one can accept payment over the phone. I cannot submit payment online. Comcast has a serious problem. I've submitted multiple online emails for resolution. I lodged complaints on the phone..so far no resolution.
"Lawrence of Charottesville, VA",41016,2,"Gary **, a Comcast technician did repair a computer connection that provided me with good service. However, without telling me, he did disconnect a wireless modem leaving me with no service in another area. After two conversations with a Comcast operator by phone, I got no satisfaction. I was told to contact Netflix to make repairs, which I did. The initial inspection cost me $150 and he had to purchase and install a more advanced modem, adding another $250 to the bill. Thus, the total situation cost me $400. Since your technician created the problem, and did not tell me about it, I think a billing adjustment by Comcast is appropriate. "
"Janet of Oakland, CA",41016,1,"Unauthorized credit check - All I did was go to Comcast's website to check out prices for their internet service. They required my address so I entered that information. Today (04/16/2012), I received a letter from Comcast informing me they had made a credit inquiry on me. I know that numerous inquiries can hurt your credit and I never authorized or requested this. I am outraged that Comcast would do something so sensitive without permission. I now know that I will never trust this company and will never use them. How can I undo this credit check? I feel so violated and helpless."
"Kowhe of Chicago, IL",41015,1,"I have been using Comcast high speed internet for a long time. It works fine until recently, I got no signal with my Comcast internet connection. So I called Comcast tech support, and they tried helping me on their end, but still could not figure it out, so they told me they will send a service people out to my residence. Two days later, the Comcast service tech called me and asked me if the problem still exists, and I tried again and it looked OK, so I told the service guy need not to come to do the checking since it works again. But the Comcast guy insisted to come.After he took a look of my cable modem/router, he said everything looked fine now -  the cause may be due to the Chicago water facility works surrounding my neighborhood, and he left. Three weeks later, I received my monthly statement from Comcast which included a $30 charge for the service I just mentioned. I called Comcast customer service, and discussed with a service rep my case. She then discussed with her supervisor and called me back and said, Š—“I am sorry, but this is a legal charge. We can not return your money back to you.Š— Above is my true experience with Comcast recently. I just like to warn others who are currently using Comcast service, be aware of the unreasonable, unfair charge you may get, even if the problem is not in the customer's end."
"M of Apt 545, va",41014,1,"I needed to scale down for budgetary purposes and decided I wanted to get rid of my cable service altogether, but keep my high speed Internet, which I use for work-at-home purposes. Comcast threatened that if we canceled our cable, they would raise the price of high speed Internet, so that it would cost more to do high speed Internet only than to do high speed Internet plus cable. These people are savages. This is supposed to be America. We are supposed to be concerned with monopolies and trusts - with collusion and price-fixing and absence of competition - with the bullying of the American consumer. Shame on Comcast and on the American politicians."
"Jeana of Kingston, TN",41012,1,"First time, they were hours late, then no call, no show by Comcast twice. On 4/6, I had an appointment for installation of new internet/cable service between 3 and 5pm. I waited until 6:15. They called and said they would be late obviously. They showed up around 7 and don't have the capability to hook up all TVs, so they run a cable on top of our driveway to our main TV and left. Today is 4/13. I haven't seen them since. They have stood us up twice this week, once on 4/11. We waited four hours for them. I called Comcast and a man told me he would call me within 15 minutes with an explanation. No one ever called. Then the next day, I called back and they informed me I had another appointment on this day, 4/12, between 3 and 5pm. Guess what? No show again! No call! Nothing. I have never been treated this disrespectfully! I have missed work waiting on this company. If I get a bill for this crappy cable that only works on one TV half the time, I will be even more upset! Do not use Comcast!"
"Christy of Wartburg, TN",41010,1,"I called to set up new service to the above address. We are moving in from out of state. I give the lady I talked to all the info she needed. She runs my credit check and tells me I have a $50 deposit. After I pay it, she takes the $50 out of my account. She says, Š—“Oh, we don't offer service at that address.Š— They did not give me a refund and told me to call my bank and dispute the charge. This is not right, they stole my money."
"E of Hayward, CA",41008,2,"I had an appointment with Comcast to have our internet switched to their service last Wednesday. That appointment was changed to today, 4/9, as they had the home number listed incorrectly. Instead, they had my cell number as the number to which the internet was to be connected to. We called Comcast and got the correct phone number to them and we were rescheduled to have the internet connected between 7:30 and 8:30 this morning. Today, I sat and waited from 6:30AM to 8:30AM with no call from Comcast. When I called to ask what happened, they claim they were locked out of the gated community and they called my phone and no one answered.This is a gated community, but my front door is directly on a street. There is no need to go into a gate to get to my apartment. You just need to go to the front door and knock. How hard is that? Also, they never called my cell phone as the tech claims and after reading all the comments of people who had bad experiences with Comcast, I read over and over where the techs called the home phone instead of the cell number that was left as a contact number. I have a home phone line, but not a home phone. We do not use our home phone line at all and that was explained to Comcast. After two bad experiences trying to get Comcast internet set up, I do believe this is a wake up call to not get Comcast internet! Comcast mixed up our phone numbers, our information, twice. I will not give them a third chance. If there is this much trouble trying to get their internet service, then I will take it as a sign not to go any further with this mess. Comcast seems to be too big for its britches. The commercials that Comcast has on TV about their excellent customer experience are just empty words."

They asked for a deposit of $105 and they're still charging me for the visit. That really sucks. "
"Marcos of Hialeah, FL",41004,1,"I originally cancelled my Comcast service about 1.5 years ago. I cancelled due to their anti competitive practice of allowing 250 gigs of traffic, which is mainly meant to slow down Netflix adoption; so at that point, I decided to vote with my money. I moved to Uverse whom soon after activated the same limits as Comcast. After having billing issues with AT&T, I moved in with my grandfather and I decided to give Comcast another try. On Monday 04-02-11, I called to add internet to my grandfather's account. I confirmed details such as the name on the account, account number and address. The service was added without a problem and I was told to call back in one hour to activate the service. I called back on Tuesday 4-3-12 to add the MAC address and activate the service. I spoke to the tech department and provided the MAC address to the rep (the modem started to work immediately). The rep then requested the social security number of the account holder. I explained that the service had been added on Monday and that this information was not requested at that time. I voiced my opinion and stated that whatever information was needed to add a service should have been asked for at the time that the service was added. I informed him that the account holder was unavailable at the time due to the fact that he was sleeping at this time (9:30 pm). The rep insisted on the information. I decided to go speak to my grandfather and provided the last four numbers requested. The rep then requested to speak to my grandfather. I explained to the rep that my grandfather is not a native English speaker. I also explained to the rep that if he wanted to speak to the account holder, he should have said so from the beginning. I asked him to not give me the runaround. I mentioned that it is bad service to the customer to not process things in a clear order. He should have clearly mentioned that he needed to speak to my grandfather from the beginning if that's what he needed. I mentioned again that my grandfather did not speak English. The rep said that there was a Spanish line and that I would need to call there. He did not offer to give me the number or transfer me. He then mentioned that as long as he can hear my grandfather giving me the information in the background that it would be fine. By this time, I had mentioned various times that the modem was actually working and that if they were so concerned with security that they should turn the service off. I spoke to the supervisor of the associate that was helping me. I restated everything that had happened but she was equally unhelpful. I also mentioned to her that the service was actually working and that I just wanted the billing issue resolved. I asked if I could give the correct social security number and she said that I'd have to go into a Comcast office. I insisted that the issue be resolved immediately. I asked to speak to somebody who could do something and she mentioned that she was the only one on the floor. I asked to be transferred somewhere where I could be helped and the supervisor said okay. I asked for clarification as to where she would transfer me and she said that she did not have any control where I would end up. She stated that she would just transfer me to another call center and that she did not know who I would speak to or if they would be able to help me. I gave up on the situation for that night.On Wednesday morning, I woke up and found that the service was working. During my lunch break at work, I called corporate and informed them of everything that had happened. I did not give the social at that point (my failure), but they mentioned that we would need to go in person to a Comcast payment center to correct the problem. They also mentioned that they would address the training issue so that their representative request the information they need in an order that makes sense. They also confirmed that I would need to go to a Comcast payment center to correct this. On Wednesday afternoon, I spoke to my grandfather who informed me that he spoke to the Comcast Spanish line and they had mentioned that all was in order. They mentioned that the social security was correct and they even committed the sports package that I had added on Monday for him. I feel that we have been racially profiled our native language. I also feel that having my grandfather speaking in the background to someone who admitted to not understanding Spanish may have been ill motivated. I come to this conclusion due to the experience in the Spanish call center where the issue was addressed (temporarily). On Thursday morning, I woke up to no internet connection."
"Tanisha of Richmond, VA",41003,1,"Customer Service, Canceled Account and Billing : I selected Comcast to handle my landline and my internet service. An appointment was selected and they came out during the appointment on March 8, 2012 and everything was fine. Until I woke up the next morning (March 9, 2012) to discover I did not have a landline dial tone, but I also did not have internet service. I contacted Comcast to find out what the problem was but found that they were unable to locate my account in the system. After approximately 15 minutes of searching, they located my account and determined the individual who installed my service did not ""push"" the order through and they would need to correct this matter. Within 90 minutes the internet was back up but the landline was not. I was told I would receive a phone call to confirm the landline was taken care of but that call never came. Just 45 minutes after the internet was restored, it went down again. I again contacted Comcast and the matter was ""fixed,"" but they still could not locate the phone number and that matter would be looked into and I would receive a phone call. That phone call also never came. I decided to do business with another company and have the phone number ported over. After four days of the new company being unable to port the number over, I contacted Comcast and was transferred to four different individuals before I decided to cancel the entire thing and get a new phone number. I was told I would not receive a bill because I cancelled in less than 30 days. I was never instructed where or when the equipment needed to be returned, so I took it upon myself to do this. I received a bill reflecting a balance and when I called to inquire about the charges, I was told the bill was incorrect and that I in fact did not have a balance and a new bill would be sent out. On 3/24/12, I returned the modem and router to the Comcast store in Richmond, VA. On 4/3/12, I received a bill reflecting a credit but not for the entire amount. On 4/4/12, I began the tedious task of contacting Comcast to get the matter resolved. Beginning at 17:37 hours on 4/4/12, I was transferred to collections because Adrianna could not assist me. At 17:42 hours, I spoke with John who could not assist me but stated he would transfer me. I told John I did not want to be transferred again but wanted to speak with a supervisor. At 17:50 hours, I spoke with Matt who advised he could not help me. I disconnected the call and called back. I called back, held for 12 minutes waiting and was disconnected before I could even speak with a representative. I called back, held for 10 minutes 20 seconds and spoke with Sheila who advised me she could not assist me but would get me right over to someone. At 18:25 hours, I spoke with Larry who attempted to assist me but the call was disconnected. I called back and held for 25 minutes and 20 seconds and spoke with Jeremy at 19:02 hours who advised me that he could not help me and that I would need to physically go into a location with the receipt showing it has been returned and the account will be zeroed out. Jeremy advised Larry was mistaken when he said he could assist me over the phone and because they could not verify with their own eyes that the equipment had been returned they would not believe that it had been. When I pressed Jeremy for another solution, he advised it could be faxed but that it would take two or more days to get to him for it to be processed. I am left with no other choice but to go into the Comcast store to resolve this matter because I have a Jewish Holiday coming up and surgery and cannot wait the time period for the matter to be resolved before my account is submitted to collections and negatively impact my credit score. I am beyond upset with how disrespectful of my time Comcast has been. Customer service has not been helpful and only wants to transfer the call to someone else or advise previous information is incorrect. I do not believe what Comcast representatives advise and do not trust that this matter will actually be resolved."
"David of Apt 200 i, GA",41002,1,"I started service with the GA Comcast service in Lawrenceville. I bought my own modem from Fry's Electronics before starting service with them. All was fine with service, billing - everything at that address. I moved to Cumming, GA and that was when things went bad. First of all, the account rep put on my service order that I needed a modem after telling her several times I owned one. When the tech arrived to set up my service, he saw that I already had a modem and had it properly notated on my account, so I was not charged for it the first month (April 2011) at my current address. I made the mistake of trusting it was off the rest of the time. When my bill went up after 6 months of promo time, I logged in and looked at my bill finding the modem lease fee on my bill. I called and was told they had to escalate it and would take 2-3 weeks to get resolved. After no response for 2 months, I called back in and was told it was not resolved yet. However, it should be soon and I was welcome to stop paying for the modem as it would be credited back to my account. After 3 more months of this, I called in again. This time, I got a competent CSR who made the corrections. However, when they reactivated my service properly, somehow they entered my modem as a rental. I had to take my modem to my local office with proof of purchase to prove it was a retail, not theirs. The ladies at the office were quite helpful and put the proper notation in my account. I was told I had to call back in to corporate to have them correct the billing and listing. I did that, however, the CSR said she didn't have the authority and a supervisor would have to fix it. It got corrected without contacting me. I called back in 2 days later to find this out, but the credit for the nearly year of paying has not been taken care of. I was again told a manager had to do this and would call me within 3 business days. I told them I would register a complaint if no call within that time. Obviously, not taken care of."
"Cynthia Marie of Nashville, TN",40997,1,"I contacted you back in November or December 2011, with issues of overcharges by Comcast for services that were not provided. This has continued, despite numerous calls to Comcast to straighten it out. I downgraded my services, as well, and am still being charged.First, I have been charged every month for DVR service, since as far back as I can find bills (January 2011). I don't have DVR service, I don't have the equipment. Second, I am being charged for a top-tier of services, including multiple channels, which I do not have access to, and that includes the DVR, telephone (which has been disconnected completely) and high-speed internet. Third, I received the lowest level of cable TV and internet, and was quoted a monthly cost for both of less than $70 plus taxes and fees. My last two month's bills have both been over $140. Lastly, I have called, emailed, and ""chatted"" for approximately 20 hours since January about these issues, and nothing changed. Well, they did disconnect my phone but two weeks earlier than requested and they are still charging me for having the service.You might ask why I continue with Comcast, itŠ—Ès because there are no other providers that I can obtain service with. I live in a high-rise apartment, and have been told by Dish, DirecTV and AT&T that since the management has a contract with these providers, the individual tenants cannot obtain individual service. The management does not provide any of these services, whether at cost or free, to any individual tenant, but it still prohibits other companies from making a contract with individuals. My only choice to receive TV and Internet is via Comcast. Thankfully, I've been able to get limited cell phone use and cancel Comcast phone to save some money.Comcast now charges for any technical support, and debited my bank account without my permission for a down payment of ""Xfinity Support"" that has been credited back. However, the monthly charge for this technical support appears on the bills I receive as well. I thought this was taken care of, but depending on what day I look at my bill, the $39 charge is there some months, not there some months, but the bills are still too high for what I have purchased from Comcast. Why is it that cities smaller than Nashville have multiple cable providers, but Comcast/Intermedia/Viacom/ whatever they've been called, remains the sole cable provider in Nashville, TN. I thought there were laws keeping monopolies like this from happening. In any case, I'd appreciate it if you'd help me straighten out the bills from January 2012 forward to only show the service I have received. Thank you."
"Barbara of Crofton, MD",40997,1,"My new next door neighbor (condo) subscribed to Comcast and the serviceperson switched mine in error. Then, I also found her box and switched her. However, mine was never returned to my Verizon. I had to have Verizon come out and repair the damage to the box and wiring. I called Comcast at least 6 times with no return call from any person. They are responsible for paying for the mess that they made and I want this to be resolved ASAP. I would never recommend Comcast to anyone as they are totally incompetent. I want my $98.70 that they owe me."
"Renee of Tamarac, FL",40997,1,"Well, I cancelled my cable service with Comcast because it got to be too expensive and told them not to cancel my internet. So, they cancelled the internet 5 minutes after they left. They were supposed to come out yesterday. After calling them, they told me they tried calling my house number (which I told them that's the house number which is through the internet), and to call my cell number. Do you think they did? Nope. I gave the cell number to 4 different people. They have a bunch of incompetent fools working for them. So, today they rescheduled to come to my house between 9-11. They showed up at 10:30. They do not care about their customers. This has to be the most horrible experience I ever had in my life. They gave me a $20 credit for yesterday and they are giving me internet for $19.99/month for 6 months. When this is done, I'll be changing my service."
"Rebecca of Seattle, WA",40996,1,"When I switched to Comcast last August, I was supposed to receive a $250.00 Visa gift card. It would take 4-6 weeks for processing. It has been almost eight months and I still haven't received anything but the run around and several credits for poor customer service. There was a problem with the billing every month and every month I would ask about the Visa gift card, only to be told the coding wasn't done correctly or wasnŠ—Èt on the account at all. After being told month after month that the Visa gift card coding on the account hadn't been done correctly, a supervisor gave out someoneŠ—Ès home phone number when I requested a contact number for Visa. Elisa at Comcast assured me the end of December the Visa gift card was on its way. Then I received confirmation emails from Agatha **, but I still don't have a gift card. I called Elisa beginning of March and left messages for two weeks with no return call. I followed it up with an email and now no one seems to remember my account information. I've received several emails from the executive customer care team for Comcast's Washington market that sound like a blow off. This is fraud and false advertising. I don't care how many unasked for credits they apply to my accountŠ—”I would like the $250 Visa gift card that was part of the original package."
"Cathy of Washington, DC",40996,1,"Many months ago, I signed up for Comcast Extreme 50 internet service and am billed at $100 per month. When the internet is working (which it often doesn't), I have never got the speeds they promised me. Best speeds are (via ethernet cable i.e. wired) 9-13Mbs download and 4Mbs upload. Service is often so slow, it times out. Repeated visits by technicians who tested it and said it was not their area of expertise and someone else would come to fix the issue. At their recommendation, I have purchased a new modem and upgraded both my router and adapter. Repeated appointments made with Comcast and technicians failed to arrive. One technician determined that cables from the Comcast box in building to my unit need replacing, as do the cables within my unit. Repeated complaints to Comcast technicians and still, the issue is not fixed. When I threatened to go public via social media, they sent someone out to replace the cables from the box to my unit, but the guy said he couldn't replace the other cables as he ""didn't have white cable only black"". He told me someone would contact me within 48 hours to come and replace the rest of the cabling. A week later, and nothing. Comcast refuses to lower my bill while I am not getting the correct speeds, and insists I continue to pay full price for a service which I am not getting. Unfortunately, Comcast has a lock on the downtown DC area, including this building, and no other provider is able to service this building to provide internet services. Still, that does not give them the authority to charge for a service that they are unable to provide. "
"Leann of Plymouth, MA",40994,2,"I manage my husband's solo pediatric practice. Reliable phone and internet service are critical for our patients. Comcast is responsible for our phones and internet and it is very unreliable! On a busy Monday morning, like this morning, the phones go down for 30 minutes and Comcast can't tell us why. Worse, they do nothing to keep it from happening again. I pay for service that I don't get. I want Comcast to fix the problems so that phone and internet are reliable. "
"RICHARD of Boca raton, fl",40993,1,"Several months ago, unfortunately, I upgraded my Comcast service agreement to include telephone service. Doing so required a different modem and rather than renting the modem from Comcast, I opted to buy a modem. This modem required a Comcast technician to install and the installation was completed. Shortly thereafter, within 30 days, I began to experience internet problems - getting knocked off and/or not being able to log on. Once again, a technician came to my home, tested the entire system and concluded my purchased modem was at fault. A Comcast modem was installed and I returned the purchased modem for a replacement. When that modem arrived, another Comcast technician was called to install.For a short time, everything functioned properly. Then my phone service stopped working on March 19, 2012. I immediately called and reported the problem and was transferred to tech support, who determined that the modem phone function was not working and needed to be replaced. I shared with the technician that I also had no internet service. I was transferred back to customer care. I was told the earliest appointment available was for March 23 between 3:00 and 5:00. I screamed and yelled to no avail. Since I could not receive or make phone calls using Comcast, I provided customer service my cellular number for purposes of confirming the appointment.At 5:30 on March 23, I again contacted Comcast and was told the service technician called and there being no answer, cancelled the appointment. Of course, the call was made to my home phone number, not the cellular number. Again, Comcast was apologetic but could not provide a technician until March 27 between 11:00 and 1:00. But I was assured that someone would call me in an attempt to expedite service. No call was received, so the next day, I re-contacted Comcast and reminded them that my cellular number, not my home phone number, should be used to confirm the appointment. Now I wait to experience another disappointment. Something must be done. A strong message must be delivered to Comcast."
"Lisa of Nolensville, TN",40992,2,"I have been a Comcast customer for several years. In February, I placed an order to move my service to my new house. The new service was activated on Saturday, March 3. I had several issues with my cable, but they have now been resolved. I continue to have issues with internet, more specifically, my Comcast email. When the new service was activated, the Comcast installer did not bring a router. We could not get wireless to work with the Comcast router that I brought with me from my previous residence. I was instructed to call Comcast to order a router, which I did. It arrived about 4 days later and I activated it according to the directions. Everything was fine for a couple of days. Then my email no longer worked. It did not work at my home, it did not work on my Blackberry and it did not work when I took my laptop with me to Starbucks, etc. I called Comcast only to discover that they had shut my email addresses down. Apparently, the move order did not include (although I made a point of requesting) the transfer of my email addresses and they had been cancelled. During this call, I was assured they could turn my emails back on and that it would take about 48 hours. True to their word, I had email again in approximately 48 hours. But about 24 hours later, problems started. This was on or about Thursday, March 15. I could log in to my Comcast email account, but when I attempted to open any of my emails, I got an error message stating that the webpage could not be displayed. I tried my second laptop and the same thing happened. I called Comcast and was informed that I had problems with my laptop and was instructed to follow directions to reset my browser and other things specific to my laptop. It did not help on either of my laptops. My first call about this problem ended with no resolution. I decided the next day to take my laptop to Starbucks. I was able to log in and open all of my emails at Starbucks, so I called Comcast when I returned home. Now on March 17, to explain that the problem probably was not my laptop since I did not have the problem except at my residence, it was then suggested that I needed a new (another new router since the ones I was using was only a few days old) router/modem. It was shipped via expedited shipping and it arrived on Wednesday, March 21. Once again, I installed and activated the new modem/router and even with the new router, I continued to have the same problem. I called Comcast and was eventually told that a ticket had been issued to bump up my case to national (?), another level of customer service, and that I would get a call within 24 hours. I did not get the call and so tonight, Friday, March 23, I called Comcast again. I was told, after being instructed to reset my browser, which I opted not to do because I do not trust Comcast to fix anything and do not feel good about following any instructions that mess with my equipment, that the case follow-up phone call did not have a deadline until Saturday, March 24. I opted to end my call to Comcast at that time and waited for the call on Saturday, March 24. I am beyond frustrated over the problem and Comcast's inability to fix my problem. When you look at the entire process of the activation of my service since March 3, it has been an absolute disaster."
"Larry of Memphis, TN",40992,2,"My phone, TV and internet service is so weak that it continually loses it's signal, is totally interrupted and disconnects service. I have called Comcast and have been promised 4 different appointments this week. No one has shown up for any of the scheduled appointments. This is the worst service ever, FCC should decommission them."
"Erin of St Paul, MN",40991,1,"In December of 2011, I made the decision to move up to broadband from dial up. The Comcast install rep installed things and once up, he commented on how slow my computer was, suggesting that I disable certain functions on my computer to improve speed. I did not do this, as I didn't have enough knowledge of what each function did to mess around with that.After using the new service for a bit, I went to Comcast's website and noticed they had a download available, which said ""optimize your computer for Comcast"" or something to that effect. I'm very cautious about downloading anything, so I called Comcast twice to verify that the site was indeed theirs and asked if it was safe to download. Both reps said yes, with the second one verifying the web address I provided was Comcast's.Later that night, I was no longer able to connect to the internet. I noticed certain programs were missing. Slowly, everything on my computer was wiped out. Fortunately, I had backed up my files, but now my computer is useless. I tried reinstalling after a long search to find the product key, but none of the drivers work, except for the CD. Modems aren't recognized. All the programs I had are gone. As stated, I was very cautious about downloading things. I had only had my computer crash once before and that was when I first got it and started using the internet. The first day I got broadband from Comcast, I got a virus from the download on their site and my computer crashed.I called Comcast and requested to speak to a local supervisor. I spoke with Patti and she herself stated that it was definitely the link on their site that caused my computer to crash. She said she was going to look into some things. I called her again and she said it was being processed as a damage claim and that I should call her back by about mid January 2012 if I didn't hear from her. I didn't hear from her and called her back, only to get her voice mail. I called a few more times, getting her voice mail every time, and let her know I would be suing the company if I didn't receive compensation for my computer. I have not been able to pursue this due to lack of enough money to file a case in civil court.Up until today, March 23rd, my mother had not received her monthly bills. We assumed this was how Comcast was reimbursing me for my computer. We found out differently. There came a bill in the amount of $400. My mother called the regular Comcast line and explained the situation. She asked if they could allow her to pay the bill in increments until she could get caught up. They refused and said if she didn't pay they were going to cancel service. Someone from Comcast kept calling about the bill. I called and told the rep I spoke to, not to call anymore or we would sue for harassment, explaining that this was already discussed with another rep. She continued to argue with me, even when I told her about the do not call law.I called Patti, the supervisor I had spoken with, and told her again that I would take Comcast to court for the damage to my computer and told her (again, via voice mail) about the situation with the billing issues. I explained that my mother had been a customer for 30 years and how despicable it was, that both she and I had to deal with this. I'm not holding my breath waiting for her to call, much less resolve this. I have these conversations recorded and explained to Patti when I spoke with her in December, that I was recording any conversations I had with the company. "
"Elma of Potomac, MD",40988,1,"I moved house last February 15, 2012. Prior to the move, I called to terminate my cable/Phone/Internet with Comcast. I was advised to return the following items: 2 receivers and the modem. My husband paid all the unpaid bills so that we can transfer the service to the other home. I then went to Comcast Gude Drive office to return all the equipment they asked, 2 receivers and 1 modem box, and in fact, I also returned 2 remote controls. I made sure to go and return these items myself to make sure that they were really returned. After one month, I get a bill from Comcast for $299.95. I called to question this bill, but no one seemed to know which department can help me. I was passed around into different departments, and the last person I spoke with, hanged up on me when I said I could barely hear her because her voice seemed so far away. So today, 3/19/2012, I drove to Comcast again, lined up like the rests of the people and waited patiently for my turn. The gentleman who helped ( thank god he was very nice), told me the items were not returned so he gave me a breakdown of the bill ($164.00 for the receivers, $80.00, and $55.65 for an additional charge for keeping the service on the other house).My husband said the bill from the other house was already fully paid and he has a receipt for it. He said he can take out the $164.00 charges for receivers that were not returned, but not the $80.00 for the modem. I told him my story, but he said he cannot do anything about it. He needs the receipt to show I returned them. But won't their system show the transaction? He said there was an activity, but he won't tell me exactly what they were. Why would he give me a credit for the receivers and not the modem if his computer says I did not return anything? Why would the system show that I was there that day if I did not return anything? I wouldn't simply waste my time lining up, waiting for a period of time, if I did not have a purpose! Because I did return all 3 items and now they're telling me and charging me for the items that were not returned, it's all a lie!This is all unfair! I think it is money making gimmick! How in the world did this happen, when I, personally brought those items and saw the man logged it in his computer, said everything is done and gave me the receipt. I can't find my receipt at this point, I am not sure if I kept it or maybe misplaced it during the move. But in all honesty, they have the items and I am being charged for it! I feel cheated and treated unfairly! I do not owe Comcast anything, please somebody help me! I told the Comcast representative that it is not a million dollars to pay, but the principle of it all, that I went and returned the items and now I am being told I did not! How can they employ people like these to handle these transactions and leave their costumers in so much grief!"
"Bobbie of Arlington, VA",40987,1,"Friday, March 16, 2012, I spoke to 4 people regarding the slow speed regarding my internet. I am unable to retrieve my emails, including accessing the internet. I requested to speak to a supervisor. One of the 4 people was supervisor Joe. He put me in touch with technician Robert who scheduled a technician come out to my home Monday, March 16 between the hours of 3 pm and 6 pm. The day before, Sunday, March 18th, I received an automated confirmation phone call. Leaving work early, I arrived home at 1 pm and waited at home for the rest of the day. The technician never phoned nor showed up! My records will show that I am an excellent customer who has been with Comcast for more than 6 years. I live in a condominium building of 295 units. Half of my building has left Comcast and have transferred their service to Verizon. I am appalled by the poor service I received from Comcast."
"Wanita of Bellingham, WA",40987,2,"In January 2011, I added Internet To Go to my services through Comcast Cable for use while traveling in our Motorhome. I already had a TV and Wired High Speed Internet service through them. When I signed up, I had to purchase their portable modem, but I signed a year service contract to avoid an activation fee.In January or February of this year, that is approximately 2 months ago, my service contract was up and we were not traveling. I called Comcast to inquire about the service going forward. I explained that we were not traveling right now, so were not using the Internet To Go service at that time. I asked if I could discontinue the service and reactivate it when we were again traveling and if I would need to sign another 1 year agreement. The sales representative said that I needed to call back because my contract hadn't expired yet but that yes I could re-activate it when we needed it again and that it would be month to month. So I called back on the date they told me and deactivated it and again made sure I could re-activate it month to month.Yesterday, March 28, I called to re-activate it, that is less than 2 months later, and I was told the service is no longer available to anyone who wasn't currently paying for it because they had signed a new service agreement with Verizon to supply Internet To Go. Quite frankly I was not happy. I would never had discontinued the service if I had been told I could not sign up again. Now I have a useless portable modem and no way to connect to the Internet while traveling. I have spoken to someone from another wireless company who said they always inform their customers who are making changes to their service if that service will not be available to them should they want it again and if the price will increase.Comcast is treating their Internet To Go customers very badly. Comcast has supplied my family with cable TV service for over 20 years and high speed Internet for as long as I can remember having Internet service. But now, I will be looking elsewhere for the services."

For about eight months, the bill was what it was to be then we got a bill for over $600. We called them. They put us on hold for a good 30 minutes then came back and said it was a mistake and it would be fixed. The next month came and the bill was over $600 again. I called and was told there was nothing they could do, that we had to pay it or we would be cut off. We did not pay it. Now, our landlord pays for the cable (Comcast) and they're doing the same crap to him and we still get bills from Comcast for stuff the landlord pays. It's ** and now my mom has no phone or net and they're telling her that they can't get anyone out there until Friday. They were rude to her on the phone and there was no manager to talk to her. There was no way to file a complaint. My grandmother lives with her and my aunt and she has that Life Alert so if something happens, they won't be able to call for help.

I then showed him the contract, which stated that I had also ordered TV services, of which he replied, ""It doesn't matter. I can't do anything if itŠ—Ès not on my work order."" I called the rep, who initially signed me up for service, and he said it was on the work order all the time. The tech refused to show me what his work order said, so I was told they would return and finish the install. At 5 pm, I called again and they told me that someone had called me and that I had said ""tomorrow would be fine"". I never received a call from Comcast and I was by the telephone the whole time. They simply lied! I still do not have TV service and I am not going to pay for something I do not have! The integrity of Comcast is very questionable.

I told them I was reading the confirmation email that stated a one-time $25.00 installation fee. After calling 3 times and getting disconnected twice, I was told they were going to do me a favor and credit my account $25.00 next month. I was told the $30 in-home service fee is for them coming out, not for installing, even though it was never mentioned.

The link to billing details in my online account was broken. The online statement is not clear, which goes against their guarantee: ""We will offer easy-to-understand packages and provide you with a clear bill. Our packages are designed to be straightforward.

Now, the appointment was scheduled for today (28 Feb 2012) between 6-7 PM. The tech didn't show and claimed I wasn't home. This is demonstrably false, I've been sitting here since 5:30 PM, waiting. No phone call, door bell ring, nothing. This is upsetting to me.I had to leave work early to get home for the appointment and that isn't easy to do. I also depend on the service which, at the moment, isn't working. Not only did the tech lie to his boss, he put me out as well. I expect a higher level of service from you and am very disappointed."

For over a week we had no phone and no security system. Tech charged us for services he didn't perform. Cable box had to be replaced within the first month. We were told 2 times that they were sending us a new box but never received them; however, we were charged the shipping fee for both boxes. We had to call multiple times to get help and were on hold and transferred around several times each time."
"Bonnie of Hudson, WI","Feb. 24, 2012",1,"I received a letter from Comcast to update modem at no expense. I sent a self installment kit. Next month, I was billed $30.00 for the kit. I contacted Comcast in September, December, and February.  I found out that I had been billed incorrectly as a new user, instead of an updated modem, then requested for refund through an agent, who did it incorrectly, so it was denied, which no one informed me of. Now it will take another two months or so to refund. I asked for a manager, and told him that this is not the service advertised by Comcast on TV. I was informed that it had no relation to my problem. Evidently, fixing a billing error is not included under good customer service."
"Bryan of Apt 202, CA","Feb. 23, 2012",1,"I have been trying to access my emails as of late and everything is saying server is not responding, yet I can go into the website and access things there after jumping through hoops to get in. Yesterday as of this date I spoke to a so-called customer service rep and asked why everything was down. I was told they changed security settings and reset everyone's account. I asked if they notified everyone and he said no. No! This is the stuff that makes Comcast service the worst, but unfortunately they are the 800-lb. gorilla on the block and you have no other choice but to go through them or else have no service in my area. And you watch they are still going to charge us for the downtime even though we did not get what we pay for. To date I still cannot get my emails though my mobile phone or have to keep entering my account information on my PC at home every time I want to check it. Unsatisfactory! We don't need attorneys to talk to us, we need somebody to jump down on these thieves and get this stuff corrected now!"
"K of Sunrise, FL","Feb. 22, 2012",1,"I cannot access my Xfinity router to reset the username and password. I have reset it several times according to the manual but I am still receiving an error message. I called Comcast to ask for help. I was informed that if I purchased additional Tech Support services, they would then help me. When I refused to subscribe to additional services to simply get help on how to reset my password and username, I was told to ""feel free to browse the internet for a solution"". This is unacceptable customer service, I'm very disappointed."
"Amy of Redmond, WA","Feb. 22, 2012",1,"When I moved into my current home, I went with Comcast over Verizon internet, because at the time, it was cheaper for a basic high-speed internet package. Within six months, they jacked the price up to about ten bucks a month cheaper than their total cable TV plus internet package. Oh well, I said, I'll stay. I've had no other problems so far, until last week. Out of nowhere, I began getting scare-ware popups, saying that I had DNS-changer malware on my computer, and to call Comcast immediately. Considering that my system runs on Linux, I was skeptical at best. I checked my DNS settings and IPs, everything was perfectly legit. I ran an anti-malware anyhow, to be thorough, and surprise! I found nothing.I then spent an hour on the phone, to speak to a girl, who tried her best to convince me that I did not know what I was doing, and tried to sell me Comcast's internet security package. When it became clear that I did, in fact, know precisely what I was doing, she bailed as fast as she could on the call, saying that a supervisor would look into it. Sure enough, within an hour, the pop-ups vanished. At least they did until this morning, when I began getting a different pop-up, this time saying that the malware is changing my computer settings. Really, guys? Really?I'm done with Comcast, thoroughly done. Stay away from Comcast, whatever you do! There will always be other options, regardless of residential monopolies, cable companies have these days. Do your research, and never let yourself be defrauded by these idiots!"
"Shirley of West palm beach, fl","Feb. 22, 2012",1,"Comcast sent me three free infinity boxes, plus three that I did not request. They also billed me $4.01 for something. Maybe the ""free"" boxes. I have been on hold for 123 minutes waiting to ask them what I should do with these three extra boxes they sent me in error. It would seem they would be too expensive to toss. Before this 100-some-minute hold, I held for 23 minutes before they disconnected me. This is not the first time I've spent my time waiting for them to answer me. September of 2011 I had a service installed that they never activated but kept billing me for. I called 11 times over a period of four months and an average of 63 minutes each call to get this straighten out. If I had any choice I would have nothing to do with their ""customer service'' department. I believe they think the customer has no choice. In some cases they may be right as I receive my basic service through my condo fee. I really hate them.  I would rather not have TV than to deal with anyone who has so little respect for their ""customers"". I'm sure I am not the only person who has had to endure this mistreatment. Thank you for letting me vent but I don't feel any better as I'm going to hold on to the hold until I go to bed just to see if they ever come on the phone!"

After calling the 800 266 2278 number we've been put on hold, disconnected several times and passed around from agent to agent-finally went on line to try and make progress but the problem was not resolved.

"Yeshwanth of Southfield, MI","Feb. 17, 2012",1,"I booked an appointment for just replacing a router recently. I was informed the charges would be $40 for it. I agreed, and the technician replaced it. But after a few days, I received my bill which charged me $60 for that appointment and replacement. I immediately called up customer care, and they told me that the request is being forwarded to the higher department, who will investigate on this issue by verifying the notes (chat with representative) on my account and then take action accordingly.I would like to know if there's a possibility to sue Comcast for such thing? Informing something and charging something else. What if I miss to check the details of the bill? We will be robbed."

"Lauren of Macclenny, FL","Feb. 13, 2012",2,"I spoke with customer service on 2/11/12 (also November and December 2011) in regards to a payment that was made to the wrong account. The payment was made on 11/29/11 for $46.24 to an account ending in #** (this is not my account). I am no relation to that account holder. I called customer service and explained that I made a payment on the wrong account and asked that my funds be transferred to my Comcast account ending in #**. Customer service refused to transfer the funds. They stated that there was a hold on the account I accidentally paid on and until that account was satisfied, they would not transfer my money to my account. I explained that I was of no relation or was I on that account that my money went to. I also explained that they could not keep my money and apply it to someone elseŠ—Ès account. They adamantly refused to transfer my money to my account and stated that equipment needed to be turned in on the other users account before they would release my funds. This is unethical and illegal. I have approached my financial institution in regards to this manner and they advised me to contact Comcast. Comcast refuses to transfer my money to my account. I am asking that Comcast return my funds to my account ending in #**."

There was no mention of the $199 installation fee, and I am requesting that you waive that fee; otherwise, we will cancel the installation.I did some research this morning and found that this it is common business practice for Comcast not mention the installation fee and wait until the customer receives their first bill to discover that they've been defrauded.

"Claire of Arlington, VA","Feb. 10, 2012",1,"I signed up for Comcast internet in August 2011. My promotion was $29.99 for 6 months, at which time, the rate would increase to $44.95. This latest bill should have been the first bill at the increased price, but when I opened it, they're charging me $62.95. I called them and they claimed they can't find that promotion. Not only that, but the people you speak to on the phone have no control over the online promotions. Calling in on the phone is different than online.  What? This is so dishonest. I can't even believe, especially since they've been pushing this customer service guarantee. They've always been incompetent, since I started dealing with them years ago, but this is just dishonest, as well as bad business process. They also told me on the phone, that they've been getting a lot of complaints about the online promotion. Shouldn't that tell them something?"
"Evelyn of Orange park, fl","Feb. 7, 2012",1,"I rescheduled an installation appointment for 8:00-10:00 on Jan. 31 and no one showed up. I called Comcast to ask why I kept getting the runaround with the computer automated system which automatically hangs up on me 5 times before I hit a different number for billing that reached an actual person. The customer service rep apologized for the tech not showing up and stated I would get a $20 credit and rescheduled my appointment to Feb. 6 from 8:00-10:00. The technician did not show up again, I never received a phone call or anything to cancel the appointment and after calling, the agent told me that it was cancelled due to lack of the pre-payment. I told the agent that I was never told I had to pay prior to and that had I been informed of the reason, then wouldn't I have paid to ensure I did not take off another day of work and inconvenience myself to wait on the installation of cable in my home? He maintained composure even as I was angry to the point of being rude and then asked him for a supervisor because I explained that no one had told me I was to ""prepay"". He said he was not privy to the prior conversation, but he's reading the notes on the account. I wanted the phone conversations which I was told were recorded to be brought up so that they can see I was never told that information. After about 45 minutes of going back and forth, I was given a ticket number (**) and told that a supervisor would call me within the next 4 hours. Of course, no one ever called me back and I waited until 10:00 the next morning to call again. I was transferred to different areas and told that all supervisors were in a meeting and that my ticket would be ""expedited"" and I would be called back today. Again, I was not called back so at around 2PM, I called to reschedule an installation appointment as Comcast is the only cable service in my area so I have no alternatives at this point. I spoke to an agent who explained that due to my appointment being ""cancelled for lack of payment"" on the two occasions she could not even give me the package that I signed up for in the first place. I have been given the runaround and I do not appreciate it since I have been a good paying customer since 2008. My time is too precious to be wasted trying to figure out why in the world I was not told to prepay and yet the account is noted that they informed me. I was again rerouted to the sales department so that I could basically start from scratch. The customer service agent was finally able to help me and she stated she did not understand the hassle because I have been a good customer and I am not even being charged a deposit, so why would they require that I prepay? Comcast has a monopoly on the area and the fact that I was inconvenienced twice and took time off from work was already headache enough. But to be treated as if I am someone who does not pay my bills was even more insulting. I feel as if the fact that they are the only alternative, they don't take the responsibility of taking care of their customers very serious. I was given the runaround and told I would be called back within a certain time frame, I should not have had to call back again without some sort of resolution to the issue."
"Patrick of South Hadley, MA","Feb. 7, 2012",1,"I use Comcast for Internet connection only. I have no choice whatsoever and pay $63.66 monthly. Out of curiosity, I checked the cost of internet connection in London (Pond Sterling 3.25), in Paris (10 Euros) and in Berlin (12 Euros). I wonder why an Internet connection in the US should be by far, more expensive?"
"John of San Francisco, CA","Feb. 4, 2012",2,"I have recently ordered two movies (and several more in the past) from On-Demand that were shown to be close captioned but were not. I am deaf and could not enjoy the movie without the close captioning. It is not right that I should pay for movies that I cannot enjoy. Also, it is very frustrating to select a movie that states it is close captioned and then find out I cannot watch it. The two movies were ""Real Steel"" and ""The Thing 2011."" I have complained about this before. You need to ensure that if a movie listing indicates that is close captioned with the CC symbol that it actually is."
"Robyn of Arvada, CO","Feb. 2, 2012",1,"I have been with Comcast for over a year now and have not had a complaint with them until now. After our Comcast introductory rate ended, I spoke with Judith at Comcast (employee own) to discuss what products could be taken off to reduce the bill. Obviously, like many, internet is not a necessity but a luxury especially in the economic environment.After a lengthy conversation, Judith at Comcast advised that we take off the ""blast internet"" to lower the monthly bill down $10.00 less to approximately $42.00 a month. While this was more expensive than what I was paying, it was understandable and manageable. I informed Judy that if the bill was any higher, I already had checked other servicers and told her I was ready to switch (which was also true and was prepared to switch to Century Link). Judith told me to wait and check the amount to pay on the online account which would allow me to continue at the rate of approximately $42.00/month without the ""blast"". To enforce our agreement, I checked the account which turned out to be around $15.00. All in all, Judith the Comcast representative undoubtedly stated she could keep our bill to around $42.00/month if we paid this extra amount to account for services already performed.Unfortunately, none of what Judith communicated to me was true. Comcast did not keep their word or honor their agreement. After paying the amount online as agreed, the next month I received a bill for over $115.00 which was not agreed upon and a breach of the agreement. After calling Comcast and speaking with employee Rob, he informed me that he could not lower the monthly bill and was not sure what Judith did on the account (big shocker that Comcast does not keep accurate notes the same way I did). Rob informed me that he reported Judith's actions to his supervisor and would credit my account $44.00 for the difference between what I was informed to pay online and what the bill later had in it. I understand promotional rates and roping in customers but when an agent flat out lies to you about a budgeted monthly expense and leads you to stay with a company only to hit you with a bill almost three times your normal monthly rate, that is an unethical bait and switch and downright dishonest. As a consumer, I need to report this information and shed light on the practices that Comcast agents are using to deceive their customers."
"Linwood of Oxon Hill, MD","Feb. 1, 2012",1,"I just moved to the area and ordered cable on November 27, 2011. Here it is three months later and still no cable or internet service to speak of. It has been a living nightmare dealing with Comcast and a complete inconvenience. Starting from day 1 my equipment did not come in a timely manner. After 3-5 days and more than10 phone calls, I finally received my equipment (cable HD box and wireless router); however, I noticed that none of it functioned properly. So once again I had to call Comcast to request another HD box or send a technician to my residence. The first technician never showed up; the second tech didnŠ—Èt step foot inside my residence; rather, he just went behind my home and said he turned the cable on from there. When I came home that day, I noticed my cable still was not working and neither was my internet! At this point, it was December 14, 2011 and I had become increasingly upset! The third tech was great! He appeared concerned and wanted nothing more than to right the wrong Comcast has committed (that and poor customer service are apparently the only things for which you can provide). He took his time to set everything up: outside working in the back and inside testing out the wire until finally we were on track and my cable and internet worked. Comcast failed yet again as he was never instructed to bring an HD DVR box or a wireless router. He did the best he could, even calling Comcast himself to see what the problem was and order an HD DVR box for me. Again IŠ—Èd like to point out that tech ** was great! However, he we are. 2 months later, February 1, 2012 and I have not received my HD DVR box or my wireless services.The Department of Homeland Security, by law, is required to tele-work once a week due to traffic regulations in the DC/MD metro-area. However, since Comcast has been insultingly lackadaisical in addressing my issues, I cannot work from home once a week and I donŠ—Èt have an HD cable box even though you can guarantee my bill shows these services as being provided when they are not! I have been begging and pleading for some sort of assistance since I ordered the service in November 2011. My wife is deployed in Afghanistan and makes every attempt to call when she has time. Though we could web chat via Skype, ooVoo, or web-based video links on my wireless devices if I had internet access thatŠ—Ès compatible with Skype or video services, but I donŠ—Èt. So most nights I fall asleep in living room waiting for her calls. This is affecting our children as they canŠ—Èt see her to know sheŠ—Ès alright. Though this is a luxury many donŠ—Èt have, itŠ—Ès one I willingly pay for and should be receiving just so that I can bring a sense of normalcy to my children.The customer service at Comcast is beyond deplorable! Check my service records and you will see that I have called repeatedly over the past 2 months and with no results which you can speak of. Absolutely nothing! I am disgusted and offended at the way in which this situation has been handled and am more than ready to file a formal complaint! However, before it gets to that point, I would like to offer you the chance to correct this gross negligence. I am simply looking for consistency so my family and I can enjoy our experience here in the National Capitol Region. I am begging for assistance and apologize for the abrasive tone of this communication, but my patience has run out. I would like to again stress the severity of this situation and look forward to a speedy resolution.Linwood **Washington, DC 20593-7581"
"Teresa of Jacksonville, FL","Jan. 31, 2012",1,"It seems that once again I find my self an extremely unsatisfied customer of Comcast and would like to make you aware of the unprofessional way in which Comcast is conducting business. I recently moved this past November and called Comcast for cable service. I was offered a promotion for 6 months when I got signed up for Comcast cable. At the time, I did not have a computer at home or the need for internet service. I recently bought a laptop, and several weeks ago, I contacted Comcast to request internet service. The Comcast representative told me there was an offer of $24.95 for 6 months, and he/she signed me up. Since that time, three weeks ago, I have been using my laptop with Comcast as my service provider. On Saturday, my internet was suddenly not available, and when I spoke with your representative, Melody, I was informed that since I already had a promotion on my cable service, they were not able to give me the promotion of $24.95 for internet (even though that was the price I was offered and the agreement I was under during the period of service prior to my account being ""deleted"" as evidenced in my statement from Comcast). Melody proceeded to tell me that since I was ""not entitled"" to the internet promotion, they just cancelled my account. I am appalled; no phone call, not an inkling of respect for me as a customer to explain what was going on! Just poof, Comcast personnel deleted my account and completely shut down my internet service. Since I was preparing a case for trial that began this week, this was outrageous behavior on Comcast's part to say the least. Since I would rather spend my time with people in a positive way rather than telling anyone I come in contact with these days about Comcast's lack of professionalism, I am really hoping you can provide me with an explanation as well as an agreeable solution to this issue. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you."
"Monica of Woodstock, GA","Jan. 30, 2012",1,"I was talked into bundling TV, internet, and phone.  The rep never mentioned that long distance and international would have to stay with Comcast and could not use alternate (cheaper) carrier.  2) The internet did not work for 30 days.  Wrong equipment was installed.  I called Comcast and got no help.  Instead, I was told I had to sign up for Infinity Support for $39.99 to find out what the problem was.  I was on the phone up to an hour and transferred all over, and still had no solution.  This company has no customer service.  I cancelled everything and will never do business with them ever again!"
"Diane  of Orleans, MA","Jan. 27, 2012",1,"As Comcast was the cable provider servicing the address of the home I purchased, I was forced to attempt to set up service with them. While on the phone with a local rep, she called the previous owners and got an okay from them to terminate service in their name. What ensued was madness.I set up installation appointments (multiple), only to have them cancelled by Comcast, because ""service already exists"" at that address. No lie, something like 10 phone calls later, I achieved installation. Despite this, my first bill was sent to the wrong address. When I called to see where my bill was, and to pay it, I was informed of this fact. I then paid my bill in full, over the phone. I checked, as always, to make sure that the payment was actually deducted from my bank account. It was.Next month (second month of service), I received a bill stating that my account was past due and my service was being shut off. A call to ""customer service"" (India), was met with a robotic, scripted response that had nothing to do with the questions I was asking. I was informed that my payment had been ""misapplied"". What!? To where, and whom? It was like pulling teeth to get ""India"" to transfer me to a supervisor or billing rep. There I was informed that my payment had been removed from my account and credited to another account. How could this happen, you may ask?The other account holder called up, and giving just the last 4 numbers of the debit card I used to pay, stated that it was his $300 payment. What did Comcast do to verify? They looked to see if anyone had made a $300 payment on the date in question using those last 4 CC numbers. True CIA level security measures! They then suggested I monitor that card for fraud. Not a bad idea. I suggested they ramp up their billing security."
"Jill of Richmond, VA","Jan. 25, 2012",2,"I canceled Comcast Internet and was never told to what to do with their equipment. I have moved a lot and have dealt with several ISP companies. Every time I cancel, the company makes sure to tell me what to do with their equipment. I was in the middle of moving and over paid my bill. After the move, I notice that a refund had not been coming in the mail. I called Comcast to see about getting my refund and found that they had turned me into a collection agency for not returning their equipment. I tried telling them that I wasn't told to do anything with their equipment and had left it at the apartment. They said that it wasn't their fault and that it's not their job to instruct customers on what to do with the equipment. They said it was common sense to drop it off at a local Comcast store. I had never had Comcast before and the companies I did have usually sent me a box to send the equipment back to them when I canceled service or they came and picked it up. The customer service person was very rude, unprofessional and unwilling to accept any responsibly in this matter."
"Dana of Hudson, WI","Jan. 16, 2012",1,"In December 2010, I received a mailing from Comcast advertising high speed internet for $19.99 for 24 months. I contacted Comcast to sign up and was told I would need to pay extra for their router. I told them their mailing did not indicate that and that I had my own router. They said it had to be their router. I asked what kind they used that was so special. They put me on hold and then came back on line and asked what router I had. I told them I had Linksys and another brand (I can't remember the brand off hand). They said neither would work. I asked again what brand they use and was told she didn't know as that was a technical question.After being transferred around, I was finally told there was a list of routers on their website that would work with their service. I discovered buying a router on my own was much cheaper than renting from Comcast, thus I went and bought one of the routers on their list. The tech showed up to install my internet and left without even telling me. He said he was going outside to check the line and he must have left because the next thing I knew, I was getting a phone call from Comcast with an automated message asking me to rate my recent service. I looked outside and sure enough the service truck was gone. The tech never even checked to see if the internet worked. I also never received any paperwork. I stated as much in the review and rated accordingly. Since it was a substandard review, I was asked if I wanted a rep to contact me. I indicated yes. Someone called back and I explained the situation and that I didn't even get any paperwork or ""set up kit"" the survey had referred to. The rep apologized and stated they would mail everything to me. It's been a year and I never received it.The first bill I received was for almost $100. I called and asked about it and was told it was for the service call and the first 2 months of service. I told them the bill should be around $40 as I was only paying $20 a month and there was free installation. I took about a month for them to resolve the issue and straighten my bill out. Thankfully, the following 11 months went by with no issues. In November, I bought a wireless printer and needed to hook it up to my wireless internet. I couldn't locate my WEP key so contacted Comcast asking for advice. After being transferred around, disconnected, transferred around again and then routed back to the original department I had called, I was told they could maybe help me, but it would cost $50. The rep tried selling this service telling me how it used to be a $120 house call for this, but now they could remotely access my computer and usually gets the WEP key that way. Usually, I asked about that and was told that if they were unsuccessful, they would send someone out for the $120. Since they were only looking into my computer for the code, I asked if I couldn't just find it myself. The rep assured me there was no way I would be able to do this as it required a high level of technical training and computer knowledge as I would need to change and reset computer settings, etc. I asked again, but it's possible?This argument continued for at least 5-10 minutes before the rep grudgingly and rather rudely admitted that yes, it was possible it could be done, but there was no way I, myself, would be able to do it. I told him it was worth a try and disconnected. The whole call from first initial dial to disconnect was 57 minutes; just to ask a question. I went on line and Googled how to recover misplaced WEP key. There were many, many places to look. The first site I went to recommended looking on the bottom of the router as often times it is written there. The second site I went to (specifically for my brand router) offered similar advice, stating all you need to do is log into your account- user name and password located on bottom of router. I turned my router upside down, located web address, user name and password, logged in, went to setting and found my WEP key. No technical skills, no computer knowledge, no problem. Time from first Google key stroke to locating WEP key- 5 minutes.January 2, 2011. I went on line to pay my bill- due Jan 7. My bill shows I owe almost $50. This is strange since I have been paying roughly $22-23 a month for the last year. Knowing if I paid the full amount I would never get my money back, I contacted Comcast direct and discovered it was after 8pm and I would need to call again tomorrow. Jan. 3, I called back and spoke with Stacy. Initially, she told me the deal was for only 12 months. Not so, I told her. It was for 24 months and they were the ones that solicited my business. She put me on hold and came back and said she confirmed that my deal was $14.99 a month for 12 months with an additional $5 a month charge for router rental. I told her they owed me a refund then, because I own my own router.She put me on hold again then returned and stated I was on the $19.99/month special for 6 months. I told her to check my billing history as I had been paying this amount for a year. Then she said it must have been a 12 month deal. I again told her it was a 24 month deal and I wouldn't pay my bill until they fixed it. She stated she would have to put in a ticket and would get back to me tomorrow (Wed) or Saturday. I never figured out the delay for that one. I never heard back on Wed or Sat. Nor Sun, Mon or Tues. I checked my bill and now it showed almost $100 as my bill was now late and they had added another month. I tried calling Tues night but, again, it was after 8pm and they were closed. I sent an email which guaranteed a response in 24 hrs. I explained that my bill was incorrect and needed to be fixed and that Stacy had promised to get back to me and never did.I did not get a reply to my email in 24 hrs, 48 hrs, or 72 hrs. Jan 12 I call Comcast again. I explain the billing problem and that no one is fixing it or getting back to me. I make the comment; I guess they don't want to get their money. I get transferred to the resolution center and speak to Kelly who is extremely apologetic and assure me she will resolve this problem. She comments she sees I spoke to Stacy who is actually a supervisor and awesome customer service. I told Kelly I may have agreed with her assessment of Stacy if Stacy had ever called me back like she promised. Kelly put me on hold to try and get in touch with Stacy. Kelly came back on the line and stated Stacy wasn't at her desk but that she would send an email to someone (unknown who) to get the matter resolved ASAP. Kelly assured me she would get back to me today no matter what. She said she couldn't make the person read their email, but she would for sure call me back and let me know what was going on, even if she was still waiting for a reply. That was Thurs, still waiting to hear back from Kelly.Meanwhile, on Sat Jan 14, I receive a reply to my email from Sandi. Sandi says ""Rest assured that all information included in this correspondence will help resolve your billing issue."" and then proceeds to tell me I will have to speak to a live representative to further look into my billing question.Comcast will be getting a phone call on Monday, disconnecting my service. They have the worst customer service ever. They are truly about money only and do not care about the people shelling it out. As long as they monopolize the industry, this will never change. I will be changing to a small time local provider. I will be paying more each month, but it will be worth it to know it's just one more person not paying Comcast."
"Richard of South Burlington, VT","Jan. 11, 2012",1,"I have been paying for services Comcast is not providing. I have an HD box that does not work. I went to the South Burlington, VT office to exchange the box after I spent two hours on the phone with Comcast employees trying to troubleshoot my problem. The Comcast employees were rude and did not have a box to replace mine and refused to give me a DVR loaner until a new box came in. I called the corporate office and registered a complaint. They called me back today. I continue to pay for services I am not getting. They offered to send someone over, but there was a three-hour window. I cannot afford to take the time off of work. I would like someone to resolve my issue and compensate me for the two weeks I have been without service."
"Bartley of Indianapolis, IN","Jan. 11, 2012",1,"I am planning on moving out of state in August. Since Comcast will not allow me to transfer service or provide me any way to keep my email account open through the transition period, I will loose my email account and any saved emails and addresses. They have no provision for transition at all. At the very least, this practice should be disclosed when they sell you their service or they should be customer service oriented enough to make transition provisions, even at a reasonable monthly charge.When I move and probably before then, I will get rid of Comcast and I may discontinue cable altogether before I call them to be my internet and cable provider. I have started moving all my email to Gmail and changing my email addresses as of today. I am through with being bullied by the likes of Comcast."
"Lisa of South San Francisco, CA","Jan. 10, 2012",1,"Back in August 2011, I was offered a 6-month package by Jessica **** at Comcast. I was already paying $78.08 a month for internet and basic cable. When I spoke to Jessica, she offered me a plan that would include a lot more stations plus Cinemax and HBO plus a faster internet speed. The cost would be only a dollar or so more. Fine, I want it. It will not cost me $99.99 a month. She would be giving me a credit of $20.00 a month for six months which would bring the total amount to $79.99 but I would be getting more TV and faster internet at 12 MB. I am disabled and have been out of work for a very long time. This sounds wonderful, I was so happy. After six months, it would go back to the $99.99 a month. Well, I have emailed her several times trying to get the correction fixed because I am still being billed wrongly. She has in response and said that she has emailed her supervisor for the codes but with no response. Since then, I have nothing but billing problems, email and internet connection problems. Every one says they cannot change the price so I have kept emailing Jessica. After three months now, I am being charged for Cinemax until now. They say that they are crediting it and the service calls to fix the internet and still it has not been done. I cannot believe how much time I have had to put into this. Furthermore, they will credit one and not the other when I have called on the same day. This has to be wrong that they can continue to keep my money and say that next month, it will show up as a credit and so on and on. What do I do?"
"Earl of Champaign, IL","Jan. 8, 2012",1,"I started having trouble with my internet on Jan. 4, 2012 a little after 10 pm.  I called Comcast and spoke with someone about the problem.  Right away they were insisting it was due to my equipment.  I told them that when my service was set up, the tech that did the installation told me that the signal was weak on the outside wire and that there was a splice in the line from the pole to the house which shouldn't be there.  And I said that whoever at Comcast had done the job didn't know what they were doing.  Now I have no service and they do not want to run another line, saying that is not the problem."

I told him that my order summary promised me $29.99 a month, for the Xfinity digital start, with a two year agreement. I even have it in an email, if you would like me to forward it. I also told him that the promotion was on the front page of the Comcast website. He refused to acknowledge this information, and would not help me. I was over billed for my first month, for what was promised me, for the first 12 month. I want my money back, and I want what I was promised.

"Lavada of Lakewood, WA","Dec. 30, 2011",3,"The advertising in malls by Comcast on November 7, 2011 said that installation/activation fees were waived.  I called them because of this.  On November 12, a Comcast contractor came, and I got a bill for $129.00, two days later. The service was not working as of November 20, 2011. I called and another Comcast contractor entered my home to connect the phone and internet service. I received another bill for $250, totaling $356, within 10 days. I continued to call and talked to a tech personnel, salesperson, and billing. I repeatedly asked what happened to the free installation/activation and what are the other charges on the bill.  Today, I went into their office off of 6th St. in Tacoma, and with their explanation, I ended up paying the past due amount, before they would even speak to me about downgrading the service. When I tried to downgrade the service, they told me that my bill will be higher than $109 per month.  It would be $130 per month for cable and internet. I had to pay my bill in advance by ten days. I still owe $156.40 plus $160, and I have received 20 days of service up to today. Went I spoke to a tech person, and told him that Comcast placed a virus onto my computer, and I had to pay $130 to a private business to remove the virus.  I am seeking a company or companies to provide internet service, and phone, and cable without killing my budget, and stealing $3.95 unexplained charges as taxes."
"Carrie of Greeley, CO","Dec. 29, 2011",1,"Two weeks ago I had one of my boxes stop working. I called tech support and after verifying my info through the automated service I got a person who barely spoke English to ask me every single question again. Then she asks serial number of box and proceeds to put me on hold for 12 minutes. She then comes back and asks how the other TV that I am splitting the box with is working? I am like what? What are you even talking about? Why would you ask me that? Can you see I have 2 boxes that I pay for? She then tries to tell me that is a normal question. I have been a customer for about 6 years and have never had that asked. And I have had box issues from time to time. I tell her to either answer my question or I want a supervisor. She tells me to hold. After holding 14 more minutes, call is disconnected. Immediately the phone rings and it is an automated survey asking about my call experience. I never get a real person but clearly mark the lowest scores and that my problem is not resolved. The system tells me it will call me back in 24 hours or less. I wait 2 weeks, nothing. So today I decide to try on-line help as I do not trust myself to sound civil. The tech never even offers to troubleshoot but says they will send a tech. I have explained what I have been through already, so stupid me thinks they are actually trying to step up. They offer me an appointment next Thursday. I tell her itŠ—Ès unacceptable and I have had it. This of course is not the first issues with Comcast; they are never ending and never quite fixed. I fire off ** of email while I start to shop around. They actually have a monopoly here in my town. The only other supposed hi-speed internet offered is Century Link at just 1.5 MBPS. 1.5 and no other speeds available. While doing this the phone rings and itŠ—Ès Comcast. Ever the optimist, I answer thinking my email might have actually gotten to someone who cares about this long standing customer and the way I have been treated and my non-working box. I get a snotty woman who threatens to turn off my services unless I pay her right then. Pay her a payment that has already cleared my bank for them at the beginning of the week. Another email, another phone call. This rep swears she knows nothing. She is responding to that automated survey I took 2 weeks ago. Yes, usually we respond in 24 hours but we have been really busy and it is just a coincidence that I called right now after all this mess. She says I need tech again with no troubleshooting measures and she will set that appointment. I sit and wait for it...first available now is next Friday as I turned down the week from Thursday appointment. I shop and search and investigate for 2 hours. I am stuck with them for internet at least unless I want to deal with 1.5 MBPS. No wonder they don't care about this long standing customer. They don't have to. Why, here in Northern Colorado are they a monopoly?"
"Michael of Chester, VA","Dec. 29, 2011",1,"ISP (Comcast) does not delivery anywhere near the stated (advertised) up-load speed, which causes disconnects in the middle of usage.

"Chris of Coloma, MI","Dec. 28, 2011",2,"My Internet service suffers from: shaping, speeds are shaped based on usage type; throttling, speeds are throttled per usage hours; monitoring, everywhere you browse, everything you download, everything you upload is logged on their servers; false advertising, speeds on the package and in speed tests come up the same and higher than what theyŠ—Ève listed for (I am now 18 Mbps down), but actual download speed when downloading anything is 1-2 Mbps.FCC has nailed them repeatedly on these and no change has happened. Random outrages that they don't even claim exist when you call them and insist on sending a technician out to check your system only to have the service back up in a few minutes or hours.

It was 20 minutes of voice prompts and I still got through to residential customer service. And when they tried to transfer me, I got disconnected. Know what happens then? I have to call the voice prompts.When I got through, the technical person said she does not handle complaints, she handles technical issues. I asked for the complaint phone number. She said a phone number that handles complaints does not exist.That figures. That makes sense to me that COMCAST does not have a complaint department.I would like to thank you for contacting us here at Comcast, where our customers come first.

Thank you for choosing Comcast.Hi Gina or Rick, Your ""customer comes first"" words seem meaningless. Back in May, for some reason I could not make an on line payment and needed to speak to someone on the phone. (I think your site was down) I had been working round the clock getting a project with a tight deadline out the door. I was having awful problems getting through. I was so tired I was cross eyed and wanted to go home and sleep. But I needed to make sure my bill was paid so I would be able to continue business. Then I ended up with being help captive by your (non) customer service. So I thought I would spend a little time emailing anyone at Comcast that could help. Or anyone that would care.See the text of the email below in blue and the attached screen shot of all my ""sent"" emails.I think one person called me and she raved that Comcast customer service was the best. (really?) That was it. From all these emails. One person responded and didn't even address the problem? And of course they couldn't do anything because they did not have the knowledge of how to resolve the problem. I'm sure her paycheck depends on her defending Comcast and using words like ""Customers come first"". No one knew how to escalate an issues. The voice prompts / recorded sales messages are seemingly untouchable. It simply didn't matter that I was at wits end. It didn't matter that I was the customer and had to spend (a lot of) time to document all the voice prompts in hopes of catching someone's attention. At one point later I did get a woman on the phone and I was not nice. I wanted to prove a point and read the following as slowly as your voice prompts. She kept interrupting me. Sir! Sir! Sir! (I wish I could interrupt your voice prompts).A month or so ago ,I finally got a hold of someone who said I could just call Customer Retention directly if I wanted to make payments. Doesn't that seem to little to late? I previously had Comcast at both home and office but did not have a contract at my home so I've successfully gotten rid of that issue.Did it fix the problem? Does it make me feel better that I have to call Customer Retention? Is it right that I have a dreaded sick feeling I need to dial a Comcast number if I have technical issues?Please read below and then tell me you think I should be held to my Comcast contract. (keeping in mind this email was a culmination of issues calling with both my home and office).******************************************Here's how it goes.Before you read the following think of working a chaotic week and all you want to do is sit down and watch the news. But wait. There is no signal and there's a problem with the box. So I call to see if I can somehow catch the news but instead I need to spend the better part of an hour with the following...Consider reading the following slowly to get the full affect.Press one if you have no picture. Press 2 if you ......And it goes on for a few more minutes with voice prompts.A large company like Comcast (or is it xfinity? ) probably does not need to care. However it seems so easy to actually care about your customers and make a few small changes.I will do whatever I can to not use Comcast when my contract is up. And if Comcast would find it in their large corporate heart to release me from the contract, I would appreciate it.On Dec 7, 2011, at 7:16 PM, Comcast ECARE wrote:Dear Mr. **,I would like to thank you for contacting us here at Comcast, where our customers come first.

"Janet of Harbor City, CA","Dec. 15, 2011",1,"When our mobile home park stopped including Comcast Cable TV without space rent, we were forced by default to subscribe to Comcast's Service. I agreed to a trial month and paid $59 to view nothing but junk and tried to contact our local Comcast office on Figueroa and Lomita Blvd. I later found out the store had closed and sold to Time Warner. I was unable to get a hold of anyone at Comcast. I unplugged the black cable box and put it in my closet.Months later I started getting mailings for Time Warner, some other cable company that was soliciting their services. I was not interested and threw what I thought was junk mail in the trash. Finally, out of curiosity, I opened one of the envelopes to find a telephone number to ask them to take me off their mailing list. That is when I saw that they were charging me hundreds of dollars for cable service that had been transferred from the old erroneous Comcast billing. I called and spoke with an agent who was able to zero out my account, with the exception of the $210 owed for the black cable box. She said I could return it in person at the Hermosa Beach Office on Valley Drive. So, I did.It's been a few years now so I don't remember the dates. I honestly thought everything was going to be good to go, but as you will see. It is not. I gave the receptionist (one of three sassy black girls running the show which is an odd sight in a beach town like Hermosa). I gave her the black box and she turned her monitor so I could see the final balance of $210 disappear into a nice zero! Finally, I was stoked! Another black helper gave me what I thought was a receipt of the printer and I went on my merry way.I know it was a busy day and I didn't read the paper until months later when I got another bill from Time Warner. I opened it in great expectation to see the glorious zero balance and was shocked to see a $420 charge for the $210 [that was supposedly credited I had seen the screen] and now for an additional $210 [that they were saying was for the box that they claimed had never been returned?]What craziness is this? I immediately wrote an accurate and in depth letter to the main customer complaint office in El Segundo and followed up with a phone call with yet, another sassy black woman. She was unreasonable, rude, threatening and hostile insisting that I owed their company this money. This is wrong. I don't owe them a penny. They have put this false charge on my credit report and continually call one of my son's phone numbers and harass him. I want them to nullify any charge against me and to fire those cross-prejudiced war mongers who disguise themselves as customers service agents."
"Buck of Sugar Land, TX","Dec. 15, 2011",1,"They are charging for late fees and my payment was never late!  I have the paperwork to prove it.  They try pulling these moves on people all the time, hoping you won't notice.  This is unfair business practices!"
"Derrick of Jacksonville, fl","Dec. 14, 2011",1,"Called Comcast in PA complaint center. Rep took notes, said that a rep in Jacksonville will call you. A Jennifer called, told me that no matter what I say, the balance is due. I told her that my bill is different every month and I just signed up for 39.99 for cable and 19.99 for internet. And Comcast has never sent me a bill for the same amount. We got into a heated discussion. Told her I should turn my service off. Then hung up. That was at 12:30pm. By the time I got home at 1:15pm, my service was off from the box as well as the pole that I paid for in advance.The tech had already been to my house, cut off service from the pole. Called them back. They told me that it would be a week before service is turn back on. If their rep can't understand that people get upset about things or bills she is in the wrong field, customer service. And will not get credit for the week. It will take for them to turn back on. Bottom line, I need to find an entertainment service that keep their word on how much your bill is going to be. Times are hard and every penny counts. You can't budget a bill that keeps changing every month. That's what the whole complaint was about. Comcast rep told me that she wasn't changing anything any ways. That's when I really got upset. I don't recommend anybody to have Comcast. They are the worst. Jacksonville needs to kick them out like they did AT&T."

"Mj of Annapolis, MD","Dec. 13, 2011",1,"We moved to Annapolis in November, and in anticipation we called Comcast at the end of October to see what needed to be done. When I threatened to switch services, Michael the rep offered 60 Mbps for half the price at $29.99. Of course we accepted! Comcast set up our internet service in November and ever since our speed has been painfully slow. The internet service is so slow that we can't do our Christmas shopping. We can barely open one browser at a time and we regularly experience pages that never load at all. We chatted with a rep who asked for all of our security info and actually wrote, ""Thank you for trusting me with all of your personal security information."" I provided the last 4 of the SSN, DOB, address, and account number; then the rep disconnected our chat before even assisting us! Yikes! We called to complain about the slow service and chat experience. The rep said we were only getting 1.5 Mbps. He said we needed to call back during the day since he couldn't do anything to help, not even take a message. We were very dismayed with Comcast, especially by the slow speed, so I sent them an email. Those crooks at Comcast responded by email, ""We do not even offer a 60Mbps level of service."" But they are caught because a rep we talked to over the phone previously said they were offering 60 Mbps for $29.99 not too long ago, which is when we heard about it. They said, ""You are on a special rate for our Performance level of service (Downstream speed up to 12 Mbps/Upstream speed up to 2 Mbps)."" The Comcast email we just received continued to add insult to injury and say, ""If you have proof of the offer you refer to, you can try scanning and emailing things to us but most attachments are stripped at the server level by our firewall so we cannot guarantee we would receive it. If you cannot email things, please fax us instead."" Lesson learned here: do not to trust anything Comcast says. And finally they admit to overcharging us $10, stating, ""In closing, the $10 was for a Self Installation Kit but review shows no kit was ever sent to you. they are crooks. I'm so perplexed by the unethical business practices and poor customer service that I'm ready to switch to another provider a.s.a.p."

I contacted Comcast today, 12/09/2011, to advise them that I received the past due notice and that I had made an electronic payment through my bank to them as of today, 12/09/2011.  I also mentioned to them that their billing practice is unreasonable.  They wait until the day of suspension to send you a past due notice.  As I stated to Comcast, you give the consumer no time to make a payment and you expect them to pay the day they receive the past due notice.  Now if I would have called last night, 12/08/2011, would they have given me an extension?  But I called today to let them know payment has been made.  They stated it would take 3-5 days before my service can be restored unless I pay them the past due again."
"Max of North Miami Beach, FL","Dec. 9, 2011",2,"I obtained an internet and cable service from a national Comcast number. The operator was in NJ although I am in Miami. He promised me that the channel I requested which mostly are sports were in my package. When the service was installed, the contract I thought I secured no longer existed. Comcast added an extra $5 for a sports package and that the first operator told me that I did not need. In addition, the service was installed on 11/13. I received a first bill of $80.25 which is due on 12/04. Today, I received another bill of $81.92 due on 12/24 which is not even a month of service plus the amount on account that should be locked at 80 dollars. Maybe it will change again."
"Teresa of Seattle, WA","Dec. 4, 2011",1,"We traveled for 9 months and disconnected Comcast bundle service. When we arrived back home, we reconnected and got the same bundled service. We had nothing but problems with phone, internet and xfinity connections. I was on the phone almost every day for months. Techs came to the house and set up more equipment, rearranged equipment, replaced equipment and blamed each other for the poor job done by the previous tech. On one occasion, a tech, whom I spoke to over the phone, had me do a total reconnection service myself.I questioned a Voice Service fee on my September statement in the amount of $50.00 and was told it was for the tech who replaced the wires. When I scheduled each service call, I questioned a fee and I informed that I would not pay for the service call. I was told I wouldn't be charged due to my ongoing connection issues. They are refusing to give the refund now because they are saying that the wires in the house are old. In 2006, Comcast was the company who initially set us up, connected all the necessary wires to begin with. We didn't have a problem before we disconnected Last October! So the excuses from Comcast have been from working in the area on changing the system, updating issues with the equipment, and  that we have old wires. The second issue with Comcast is, I owed them $109.39 from October and was billed on Nov 7th, 2011 for $164.19 due on Dec 7th. They are saying I am over 50 days overdue on $282.32. I was told they sent a disconnection notice in an envelope which does not show who it's from, so, I didn't open it until today, December 4th. I throw mail out that does not disclose the sender. I thought it was junk mail in fact, I tossed it and for some reason I took it out of the recycle to open it. There was the notice. How responsible is the company for this? They also said they emailed me, but I never got an email. I feel jilted by Comcast."
"Gregory of Hattiesburg, MS","Dec. 4, 2011",1,"I order basic internet service from Comcast on Sept 8. They came out connected, thought everything was fine then I waited the week or so they said they would be sending me a bill never got it. So I called and they couldn't find my account, find out it's in my sisters name. I tell them they made a mistake and it was suppose to be in my name so they go, okay not a problem and tell me it's been changed in my name. Bill comes in my sister's name which I thought was strange my sister calls gets disconnected and I call tell then they made the mistake and to put the internet in my name. I tell them about and they go again telling me okay, it's done. Here it is now October. I wait for them to reconnect my service and a week goes by the two, no service. I left town for a few days thinking they'll come out and take care of it, never did. So I called and say, ""hey what's going on with my internet."" They say it's connected and I'm like no, it is not. I had my computer on and for the last week or so and nothing, no lights blinking on the modem, nothing. So I go telling them about it for like 3 days then I get a tech telling me, ""Oh, it connected in my sister's name, hold on let me put this in your account. It won't take a minute."" Then he does it and it's connected. Then out of curiosity, I ask them about my internet package and he tells me my package was $57 dollars a month. I was like, ""wait you people have messed up again, I was ordering basic service $19.99 a month."" He goes, ""oh it says and I say this mix up mess up has been going on for months."" Now he tell me he's going to correct it, tells me it's been on for months this way and I go to check my computer to find out I have been charged this $57 a month. When I ask for $19 service, I find out I had the $19 service connected but being charged for the $57. My speed was 1.5 mbps and the $57 was like above 12. ""You have been ripping me off from the start."" Then they finally get it fixed and I get a bill of 230 dollars for what 19 dollars a month which finally was corrected in November. You gotta be kidding me. Then I find out you people charge for a month in advance which is another rip off half the time your service drops speed or is down in some areas and your telling me we have to pay you for service we don't have. I will be reporting this to the Better Business Bureau. This is your so called good business plan, well it sucks."
"Marjorie of Taylorsville, UT","Dec. 3, 2011",1,"They doubled the rates so we canceled. More than a week later, we got a message on the answering machine from a recording stating we had to have the box back by 10/13/11 and an address to return it to. Couldn't find the address, couldn't get a live person at Comcast. Finally got it back 10/14/11. Told them of the problems. No one ever said it has to be back by X date or there will be a late fee! Then we get a bill, we called them ""since you kept it so long there is a late fee"" Now it's gone to a collection agency who calls with a recording telling me to call them. This company has had the worst customer service on the planet, and the price changes every 5 minutes."
"Lauren of North Fort Myers, FL","Dec. 2, 2011",2,"The discounted computer is a scam. You only get so many days to purchase it and they never answer the phone. Comcast transfers you to Dell, who says you can press 1 to leave a message. The problem is, in order to do that you need to know the name of the person you are calling! I have tried unsuccessfully for 5 days in a row to reach them. The first couple days, I called about 20 times throughout the day. The next 3 days, I put my phone on speaker and was on hold between 4 and 7 hours each day before disconnecting."
"Mike of Newcastle, WA","Dec. 1, 2011",1,"I asked if someone could explain to me my bill, it had charges of $158.84 then credits of $102.99, then they say they had a total that I payed $261.83 and then they say i owe on $55.85 on 12-01-2011. As I am on autopay, they deducted $154.90 out of my account, so I ask the billing lady what about this. Her answer was just don't pay any mind to those figures. So what the heck is going on at this place."
"Cathy of Hendersonville, tn","Nov. 30, 2011",1,"My computer was not working.  I called Comcast and the man talked me into this program for $98.95 that could do miracles for me and my computer, and have it running like brand new.  After he took my money, he sent me to someone else who could not help me and said, Š—“YouŠ—Ère going to have to call and order the $150 program where they come to your house. I canŠ—Èt help you.Š—  I called back in the morning and got a hold of someone who tried to help again and logged into my computer and said nothing was wrong!  I told him it does it off and on.  He didnŠ—Èt clean up and all the good things I was told from the man who sold it to me.As soon as we got off the phone, I called Comcast that morning and told them to cancel this service.  It was no help to me and I wanted my money back.  I was told no problem.  The computer started doing the same exact things it was doing before he looked at it!  I bought a new computer.  On 11/18, I had Comcast install it.  So, they clearly should have seen it was not fixed!  I called today and this lady Angie only wanted to argue that because he logged in, I could not get my money back.  He was in there around 10 minutes and got out.  The problem was not fixed.  It did the same thing later.  I want my $98.95 back from Comcast for poor representation of their products and for not doing what their seller told me who got me to sign up.  False seller tactics were used to screw people like me over.  Please help me.  I am on disability and I canŠ—Èt afford to throw my money away like this.  Thank you so much for your help!"
"Kit of Bryn Mawr, PA","Nov. 29, 2011",1,"Starting just over 2 months ago, we have had interrupted Internet service. It incapacitates our business because it means we have to reboot our modem physically. ItŠ—Ès impossible while we are working remotely. The service people have been here three times but they cannot fix it. Anyone else in Southeastern Pennsylvania having this problem? We are going to have to move to Verizon Fios."
"James of ALbuquerque, NM","Nov. 29, 2011",1,"I have had 4 Comcast technicians come to my home. They say the problem is not my computer or wiring to the house. One Tech said they would ""monitor"" my house to see what was wrong and get back with me, they never did. I get such slow speeds that I cannot even open and send email. I had a speed tester set on my favorites and I get signals ranging from 2 to 65 and a ping of 56. They say the trouble is ""down the line"". What they mean is they oversold the service in my area and do not have the bandwidth to support all the customers."
"Carrie of Bolingbrook , IL","Nov. 28, 2011",1,"Comcast bottlenecks my internet if I use too much bandwith. They never provide me with the speed I pay for which happens to be their top speed. They make me go through the same tests every time they purposely slow my internet connection. First, they told me it was my splitter, so I bought a new one. Then they told me it was my router, so I bought a new one. Then they told me it is because I am not using their router, which they never offered before until recently?! After I got rid of cable TV and returned my box with remote, got rid of the splitter, they still charge me every month for the cable box. I called numerous times, one person even said he would take the charges off. They never did. They said they would research it and never got back to me either. This was over a year ago. Every time I tell them, this only happens when we all play games or live stream on the internet. They deny it has anything to do with them and say it's my modem and or router or am I using a splitter. We can have a tech come. Somehow, our internet works perfect as long as we just use it for browsing or checking emails. They lie about the advertisement too, I pay for their best connection and was told we could all play online games with no interruption by their sales lady who claims to have been a former AT&T employee. I was told this when I told them I was fed up and going to AT&T."
"Nora of menlo Park, CA","Nov. 17, 2011",1,"Comcast is an absolute disaster! We ordered an HDMI box for a new system we were having installed. The technician came to our home and was completely out of it. I should have asked him to leave. He installed the incorrect box and did not record the number of the box he removed which resulted in another TV in our home to lose service. In calling Comcast to replace the box, I was told that it wouldn't take place today when we have all the TV installers here. They were unable to solve the problem, took no responsibility and quite frankly, it was lousy customer service. We will be looking to move our service to a competitor."
"Fariba of Roseville , CA","Nov. 15, 2011",1,"It was a horrible experience getting them to come out and turn on my service. My appointment was canceled by them 3 times and it took me a month to get cable, that put a bad taste in my mouth as a new customer. After a year of horrible service, their representative called and insulted me that I owed them for the month of October and they didn't received the payment. When I checked, I never received the bill after telling her that she said I had a chat online with them and went paperless. That was a pile of **. I didn't even know I can do that after telling her that it was not me. I am afraid that my account might be hacked. She accused me of trying to get out of paying the bill and that was an insult to me especially never being late on any payments before. I asked to speak to a manager, in the transfer she hangs up on me. I finally gave up on speaking to a manager about her rude behavior and just paid what I owed, and my account password has not been resolved"

He finished 45 minutes later. All channels were good before 9:45AM and before the tech entered the box in the yard! I called and was refused for help two times by a rude representative, Phil. The rep said it was caused by a problem with snow. It is from bad connection from the box outside."

For the last 2 months, I have been getting a slow signal and/or for the third time no internet access at all. I brought this issue with Comcast, but no satisfactory answer. Curiously, this is happening since the day that one for the sales rep. called me to offer ""Blast"" which I declined the offer. I wonder, but one thing's for sure. I am canceling the service and go elsewhere for service."
"Daryl of Citrus Heights, CA","Nov. 11, 2011",1,"This is the 3rd day this week that my Comcast Internet has been down. I work from home, and this has now become a major issue. The system comes up, and then it goes down again constantly, 7 times on Sunday.  Sick of this **.  If this occurs again, I am going to another provider. I am sick and tired of nothing being done about this. No refunds, apologies, or anything at all. I am fed up!"
"Michael of Boyton Beach, FL","Nov. 11, 2011",1,"Comcast has pushed this Xfinity change on South Florida, the service level has decreased and the charges have either increased or not gone down.  There must be a class action on this recover damages for the lack of service.  I sent an e-mail to a senior vice president and somebody called offering a $15 credit, but all of a sudden my bill has stopped coming in the paper form. I want a $50 credit! !  How can they degrade the DVR service so half the shows don't record, and this morning they pushed an update (saying APPDLD on DVR and rebooting every 5 minutes) that has blown out the DVR.  I have been told that new software is coming by Thanksgiving, but where is it? I would like to be contacted if someone is doing a class action lawsuit "
"Kander of Colorado Springs, CO","Nov. 10, 2011",1,"First of all, if I could put a negative instead of one star for this company, I would. Let me tell you a thing or two about Comcast. When I worked there, all product agents and video agents alike were expected to sell, which I think is BS. Next the sales reps are liars and thieves and just want that fat commission check and get all the cool prizes like TVs, Xboxs etc. While in Ap and Video agents, we get balloons nacho day and a !@#$%^& pencil. Please don't ever work for this company and stop using this service from them. That way, they can be reformed and hopefully they will try and turn over a new leaf for their wrong doings when they lose thousands of customers at once."
"Kalavati of Denver, co","Nov. 7, 2011",1,"I recently moved to Colorado and live on a fifth floor apartment. The internet service provided by management is slow, so I wanted to buy an internet plan. I had such a terrible customer service experience, for the first time in my life. I had called Comcast to inquire about the plans and charges for installation, and everything. The lady on the other side, had an accent that is difficult to understand.  She got irritated if asked twice due, to disturbance. She kept insisting that I should buy the $99 package, even after telling politely, I was not interested.  After knowing the cost information, I told her I will consult with my roommate, and call back.  I was shocked when I heard her reply.  She said: ""after answering your all questions, and taking all my time, you are not even buying?"".  I asked if Comcast charges for customer service and time, but she hung up on me.I never had a such terrible service before. I don't think anyone would like to buy the service with this kind of terrible response. I am highly disappointed. I hope you would improve the staff. Thank you."
"Paul of San Francisco , CA","Nov. 4, 2011",1,"I hired one of the fastest internet services, ""Blast"". They gave me the wrong modem and after two weeks, I got the right one. I use a laptop (brand new, same as my girlfriend) and our internet is extremely slow. After testing our ""super blast"", the internet runs no more than 5ms download speed. I called support and they said they can't fix or configure router issues unless I enroll to a program which costs $40.00 plus $5.00 a month. It doesn't make sense at all! Talking and complaining, I got hung up 4 times by very rude customer service staff. I've been waiting on line for 30 minutes to get to talk to a manager. I don't think I make sense to get high speed internet if the person who comes to connect the internet doesn't make a test or configure the router to make the service work as it's supposed to. They try to make extra money by charging me $40.00 plus $5 a month and besides, they treat me like ** and make it impossible for me to talk to a manager. This is not what this company promised me when I was hiring their service."
"Rikki of Mobile, AL","Oct. 20, 2011",1,"Today is Thursday, October 20th. I have not had internet since sometime Sunday. On Friday and Saturday, it was shutting on and off all day long, making it virtually useless. On Sunday, we called and we're told that we were one of the seven modems down. The lady was very nice and did all she could to help. Monday, we called again because it was still down. The lady was extremely rude and obviously hates her job. A request was put in for a tech to come out between 2 and 5PM on Wednesday. I sat all day yesterday waiting for someone to show up. Nothing, so I called. ""Oh no ma'am, you were scheduled for an exterior cable inspection which was completed"". Lies! I was home all day, no one came. It is now Thursday and I am still without internet!"

"Elpidio of Hialeah, FL","Oct. 19, 2011",1,"For the past several weeks, I have been experiencing technical issues with Comcast in regards to the internet speed and the emails, which have been failed to be properly delivered in time.  I have been making several different calls back and forth for the last two weeks.  And I had two technicians come out and check out what was wrong with the internet.  They both came out and said that Comcast was having issues with the area and they had been experiencing problems.  Thinking my problem was being addressed to Comcast, I was more than patient. Two days ago, my emails weren't being sent out at all.  I contacted Comcast's customer service and asked to speak to a customer service representative.  Lenard is the name of the individual that attended my call.  Needless to say, he is the most unprofessional person I have ever spoken to.  He would not let me explain to him my problem and would only repeat that Comcast wasn't the one with the issue.  I was on the phone with him for about thirty minutes, until I got fed up with his lack of professionalism.  I asked to speak to a manager or someone of higher ranking.  He did not want to direct my phone call, telling me various times to say please and maybe he'll transfer me.  I am not playing games, nor am I acting a fool to be played with.  I have a business to take care of and an office to run.  The only thing I wanted was for someone to resolve my issue, not make matters worse.  He had me on the line for about forty five minutes after he put me on hold and said that he was going to direct me to a manager.  But he never did.  He finally hung up the phone call after having me wait more than an hour and I felt extremely insulted.  I am paying for my service.  Therefore, I expect for my problems to be addressed when they happen right away.  This was the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered.  If this keeps happening, I might just consider changing to another service provider."
"Suresh of Sammamish, wa","Oct. 18, 2011",1,"I was unable to access some websites for the last 4 days.  Comcast says that they are working on it but there's no further information.  Every time I call, they say it will take another 72 hours.  They say that the problem is localized to my area so it's not treated as urgent."
"Marykathryn of Santa Fe, NM","Oct. 15, 2011",1,"I have Comcast Xfinity and regularly get low upload speeds (2 mbps) making Skype impossible. Recently, my services have been going down all together. One time Comcast will tell me it's my router, so I bought a new router, then the next week it's my modem, the next we're back to the router. After a long discussion, Comcast finally agreed that maybe the problem could be on Comcast's end and agreed to send a repair truck. Today, I got a call confirming my appointment. Then I was told to hold for an agent. For 10 minutes, I was on hold waiting for who knows what. I hung up as that's just abusive on top of all of the abuse. I have already taken with the lines about the problem being my fault. So I went to the online chat. Someone named Zion had no idea what I had been called for other than to confirm the appointment or what further information Comcast could possibly need. Unless I get an explanation, that is just harassment and Zion certainly couldn't provide one. I just want internet service I don't have to fight for. I realize that I live in an infrastructure challenged environment, but would like a deep discount if the service is going to be so poor."
"Diane of Happy Valley, OR","Oct. 15, 2011",1,"My husband and I got a DVR in April 2011.  We were told that we would need to put a $100 deposit on DVR.  I told them that was fine.  Well, I had to return the DVR.  I asked them if I could use the deposit for last month's bill and they said no problem.  I got a call from them and they said we owe them $190.  I told the guy that I was told I could use the deposit for this month's bill.  But I was informed that the money was used for a bill that was past due.  I informed him that was not what I was told.  And to top it off, the guy was rude and told the guy good bye. I called back a little while later and asked to speak to a supervisor and told her what was going on.  I told her that I wanted the $100 back on my account.  All she said was that she could give me $50.00 for all the trouble that I had been through.  I told her I wanted to talk to one of her supervisors.  She made an appointment for me to talk to him.  He called back about an hour later.  When I told him what was going on, he told me that he would make sure that everyone would be informed of what had happened, so it would not happen again.  I told him that I felt like I lost my money, because it was not used for the right thing.  I told him that he needed to have more communication with his people.  If they had told me that the money was going for a bill, I would have not had any problems with that.  But since I was told differently, I feel that I was misled.  I told the guy I talked to that I would tell people not to use Comcast since they are a joke."
"Terry of Intercession City , FL","Oct. 15, 2011",1,"First off, the Comcast service was never right. It was a shoddy install that I had to complete. The cable boxes only worked part time and I spent the other times on customer service trying to get satisfaction. When the time came to pay the bill, I paid through their automated system by credit card. My service was still interrupted for non payment. My bank says Comcast received the money but Comcast says they never did.At this time the matter has still not been resolved. I told Comcast to get this garbage out of my house before it winds up on the curb as garbage! I will go back to DirecTv and a DSL connection for the internet."
"Karen of Fredericksburg, VA","Oct. 14, 2011",1,"I am a new customer at Comcast and a technician came to my home to install my internet service.  In testing the modem, the technician said that he had no signal and needed to access my wiring in my backyard.  Once he left and my internet was up and running, my DirectTV no longer worked.  I called DirectTV and they troubleshoot everything they could.  They came to the conclusion that whatever wiring job the Comcast technician did had screwed up my DirectTV connection.  I called Comcast at least ten times this week and nothing.  I was told that a technician would come out to fix the wiring in my backyard and that I did not have to be home.  But when I got home that night, there was a note on my door that said, ""Sorry we missed you.  Please call back to reschedule.""  What an idiot. The technician came but did nothing! I have called back today and got a real attitude from Curtis ** who said that he was a supervisor.  He didn't even care that I was inconvenienced by Comcast and I am now going on a week without a TV.  I don't know how this company is still in business.  The employees have no customer service skills and the company itself provides substandard service.  I have filed a complaint with the FCC and BBB this morning and now I'm going to write my congressman and the local TV stations.  I have names of everyone I spoke with and will mention them all.  After they come and fix my issue, I'm switching to Cox Cable."
"Diana of Albuquerque, NM","Oct. 13, 2011",1,"We left Comcast for another internet service provider. The big issue was not the internet service but, instead, issues with the administrative side of Comcast (difficulties with bill pay, the website, customer service, etc). I did not expect that the more serious problems would begin after ending the service.For the last three years, I have been billed for ""equipment"" that we did not have, because we already owned the necessary equipment and chose to use our own. After terminating the service, they began billing me for the equipment. Over the years, I spoke with many Comcast customer service people and collection agency reps. Each time, I ended the conversation believing that something had been resolved. In one of those conversations, I was asked about the equipment I had in my possession. I provided the manufacturer and model, and was told that Comcast had never carried that equipment. Finally, I thought, as usual, that the problem was resolved, but no. Inevitably, I would hear from another collection agency about payment for equipment.About three to four weeks ago, I was told, with sarcasm, that Comcast would run the serial numbers in their inventory to see if they had the equipment, and I would receive a letter as to the findings in 10 days. The customer service rep made no attempt to hide his belief that I was lying about having the equipment. I couldn't help wondering why it took three years for someone to even make the offer. I had little faith in their inventory, because the company had proved themselves to be incompetent, but my only other options were to pay for equipment I never had or file a lawsuit. I checked the mail today, and there was no communication from Comcast. I braced myself for yet another phone call from their customer service.The customer service rep checked the account and told me that they had received my equipment. I really had to hold back when I told him that they didn't receive anything from me, because I never had the equipment. Apparently, the equipment was found in their inventory. I wanted to know why I didn't receive a letter. I told him that, after all this time and being led to believe that the problem was resolved so many times, I wanted something in writing. He couldn't send a letter, so he called another department. The second department conveyed they could not issue a letter. Instead I would have to go down to an office to get a letter. That would be a half-hour drive (one way) for me and standing in line for an eternity, and honestly, I don't believe anything would come of it. I would lose at least half a day. Since the mistake was not mine and I have been put through hell over this, I believe they owe me something, and for God's sake, all I'm asking for is a letter. So, even after resolving an issue, the company is absolutely impossible to deal with. Fixing mistakes is almost completely in the hands of the customer. Now, I have to wonder how long it will take to get this off my credit record."
"Brandy of Englewood, FL","Oct. 10, 2011",1,"We got Comcast Internet Services about 2 months ago. The technician came to our house as scheduled, and began installing the equipment needed to get our internet running. The technician asked to borrow a laptop to get the internet running. We said ok, and handed him mine. My significant other went to go to get cash to pay the man, since he didn't want to take our debit card, and I was feeding our daughter. All of a sudden, after being warned of an overheating issue by me, he shuts the laptop down, claims 'it was getting a little warm' and walks outside, waiting out there to get the cash and leave. I check the laptop, it's powered off, and it's not hot or warm at all, it's fairly cool. After I finish feeding the baby, I go to power it on; my significant other is sitting with me, and boom. The laptop's boot.mgr file has been corrupt or damaged. The laptop worked fine before the guy had it. I had just used it. It's a school laptop. I'm livid, and crying, since my newborn's birth day pictures are on that computer. We call Comcast, they say they'll get back to us, that they're sorry, they're going to fix it, etc. We just wanted it fixed. We waited 2 weeks, and then called again. This time he speaks to someone in Jacksonville about it, and she says that it's going to be taken care of, no worries. We wait another week before this guy Robert calls us and gives us 2 options:  1) We can pay to fix it and Comcast will try and reimburse us, or 2) He can take it and his tech can fix it. We're a low income family with a new baby; we can't afford option 1, so we go with 2. He comes 2 days later and picks up my computer. 2 weeks pass, and we have no idea what's going on, and the guy is ignoring our calls. It's been over a month since this whole thing started, and today, he tries to tell us that his tech said that the hard drive got fried and it had nothing to do with the tech, so they want us to pay to put in a new operating system. That's over $150.00. We don't have that kind of money. I've complained to multiple people with no luck, they don't care. The laptop worked when I gave it to the tech, and when he gave it back it was broken. That's ridiculous!!! I'm ready to sue them.  I just want them to fix my laptop, and compensate us for the internet we didn't get to use in the meantime, and now they're shuffling the blame around. Don't go with them, ever, unless you have no choice!!!"
"Lucille of Alvin, TX","Oct. 10, 2011",1,"I recently moved to Alvin and made an appointment for Comcast to set up the internet connection. When the technician arrived, she said that because some of the neighbors had cables hanging low, mine had to hang low (ended up 4 feet off the ground) as well but that it would be fixed in a few days. After a couple days, the cable was only 2 feet off the ground and I had to step over it several times a day and tripped and fell one time. A week later, nothing had been done. I called Comcast, and they said they would send someone. Late in the day, no one had arrived. I called and they said there was no guarantee is would be fixed that day. I said it was a danger and I had already been hurt. They did send out a technician who buried the cable and who told me it should never have been left that way by the first technician.I emailed Comcast and told them how I felt and mentioned to them a crimped cord in the front yard. They never even replied. I feel like Comcast puts my safety last and I agree with their own technician that it was an unsafe install and should not have been left that way, and I feel that Comcast forgetting to follow up shows how little they care."
"Harvey of Princeton, NJ","Oct. 7, 2011",1,"After a hurricane in August 2011, it knocked all the wires down, and until now, it's not yet repaired. We have reported this 4 times already. We are concerned that the wires on the ground will fail, this winter or earlier. Our business depends on telephone and internet. We are a fully computerized medical practice, in a building with many others; we only depend on Comcast, the only provider available."
"Jonelle of Forest Park, GA","Oct. 6, 2011",1,"We have had Comcast since October of 2010.  However, for the first month, our internet did not work.  And it was turned off in December for copyright infringement.  The installer did not set up security on our modem.  Because someone hacked into our system, we got no signal from the beginning of October through November.  We were reimbursed for this month by Comcast.  Then, we received a call stating we were under copyright violation as they noted several French movies downloaded!  We don't even speak French and had not been able to get online!  After calling the tech support and their inadequate third party security company, it was discovered that our system was hacked and a security code was placed on the modem.  It was easy enough. In September of this year (2011), we received a phone call stating we had gone over our bandwidth, and again we were facing a copyright infringement.  What they did not know was our modem had been struck by lightning in March of 2011, and was deemed ""nonworking"".  Yet, no one came out to exchange it.  We were able to get online just slowly.  But as we had had a son with health issues, honestly the internet connection was the last thing on our minds at the time.  However, according to Comcast, we downloaded 2T of information from August 1 to the 31st.  It is way impossible.  Those IT and tech geeks out there know how much information that is, as well as how hard that would be, considering we had little to no connection! I called their security department again.  I told them there was no way we did this.  He suggested we change our security information again.  It appeared, with all of the usage, that more than one computer was involved.  So, we did.  Now, we have been served a subpoena regarding a copy right infringement from AF Holdings that supposedly happened on April 9, 2011.  It does not state what content was supposedly downloaded.  As a consumer and a defendant, this information is supposed to be made available to me.  I have the right to know what I am being accused of and the details of that accusation.  In addition, as stated earlier in this complaint, our modem was struck by lightning and we had virtually no connection.  According to the security department, they cannot prove or disprove our system was hacked, only that our IP was used to do it.  Well, I may not be the sharpest tech tool in the shed.  But shouldn't Comcast, if they are going to incorporate these security measures, at least have the technology to see if the information is being routed to another computer.  I feel that since they cannot ""prove or disprove"" hacking, they have no right to cause this stress on its customers that pay more than they should for internet.  I will be filing a formal complaint with the FTC and the BBB.  I will also contact a good attorney that may want to make a name for themselves and try to incorporate a class action suit against Comcast.  It is for falsely claiming to provide security and falsely accusing its customers of illegal practices without adequate proof to back that up.  For the record, prior to Comcast service, we had AT&T.  They were able to show us on 3 different occasions that our internet was being hacked and give the name of the modem using our connection!"
"Alfonso of Miami, FL","Oct. 6, 2011",1,"I am a Comcast business class subscriber.  I used the business line for a home office in Miami.  Comcast constantly goes down.  I would say that in the last 3 weeks, the service is unusable.  I had a tech look into this problem.  All I get is excuses.  There is always a problem affecting the area.  Cancellation comes with a hearty price.  When contacting Comcast, it is the same story.  The best one was that their DNS was down.  I found this an odd reason, considering that I run a local DNS which doesn't even use the Comcast DNS.  I suppose the point and click problem solver 2.0 doesn't take this into account, because if their DNS doesn't work, nothing does.  On top of that, they charge 5 dollars for IP address.  I need some help or direction on how to get my problem fixed.  Thanks."
"Mary of Milton, DE","Oct. 5, 2011",1,"My email was apparently hacked into and incoming emails were forwarded (unauthorized).  I called Comcast about it and during one of the calls, I found out that the technician turned off the unauthorized forwarding without my knowledge (so I could get emails again).  Unfortunately, this deleted the only way to find out who hacked into my account.I called to complain and at the Executive Corporate Office, the man told me that they were forbidden to change anything without the customer's authorization.  He called back, after researching, and told me that a technician ""coached by the supervisor"" did in fact delete the information without my knowledge.  I told him that I got ** over and no one there had to have any accountability for those actions.  He did not address that comment at all, but told me to call him if there was anything suspicious going with my email.He went on to say that the tech was a ""real nice guy,"" etc. which I did agree--they're all nice, but that was not the point.  I told him that I was the one that got hacked into with no way of ever finding out because of Comcast and I was tired of them (previous encounters).  He offered no apology and did not suggest anything Comcast could do to make up for this obvious breach of rules and security."
"Joseph of Rosenberg, tx","Oct. 4, 2011",1,"We are a local small company in Rosenberg, TX looking for faster internet service. We signed up with Comcast Business Class internet that promised 22mbps. On July 2011, the service began. Mid July and August, the service would be interrupted and intermittent connection. I called customer service and all they tell the customers is ""they are servicing the area"" with no ETA or no way to resolve. We attempted to cancel the service because of the poor internet service. Warning: Comcast locks you in a 3-year contract and if you decide to cancel, they'll charge 75% of the remaining terms. You have to request 4 trouble calls before they ""may"" consider waiving the cancellation fee. The senior tech says there is ""noise"" in the line and does not offer a resolution to fix the issue. They just leave us in the dark about what to do next. Calling is a pain over and over, and holding and holding. As of today, 10/4, service is still unreliable and unpredictable. We're glad we still have our AT&T DSL service that never had an issue. It just maxes out at 6mpbs. Do not order Comcast. They are unreasonable to new customers and will not accommodate or listen to your story. This will be posted on other consumer complaint websites and forums."
"Amanda of Ft. Meade, MD","Oct. 3, 2011",1,"My husband and I were signed up for an Internet for $19.99 for a year.  The first time they came out to install it, they tried to install both cable and Internet.  We refused the cable but they billed us for it anyway.  We called and they took it off our bill.  Six months later, we get billed $34.99 for Internet.  I called and was told that we had a different promotion, wherein the rates would eventually raise to $40 a month.When I got fussy, they told me that I wasn't authorized to speak to them about the account.  I asked for a direct line to customer service and they said that there was none so I had to call the main line.  I found the direct line to customer service on the Internet, called back and was told that the rates would eventually rise to $60 a month!  Comcast has a monopoly on Internet here on Ft. Meade, and their shoddy customer service will hopefully make the company go bankrupt."
"Kimberly of Baytown, TX","Sept. 27, 2011",1,"I feel like Comcast should come and hook my services up.  I have been a longtime Comcast costumer.  When I called to get my services transferred, they knew I needed new wiring and they didn't say that I had to pay 50 dollars for an installation fee they set up to appointments. I feel like they should hook up my cable without charging me the 50 dollars.  I am not happy."
"Cheryl of Douglasville, GA","Sept. 27, 2011",1,"Hope 1 Star means very poor service.I made a payment on 8/10/2011, which was applied to my closed residential account and not my current business account with Comcast. Since that time, my business services have been disconnected 4 times for non-payment.Each time I contacted Comcast I was told that the payment would be credited to my business account, but it has not. As of today, I was informed that their practice is to issue a check within six weeks. I was assured that someone from Comcast would contact me to inform of the status of account. However, these were false statements because my service being interrupted is the only indication that the issue has not been resolve. (On several occasions I have contacted Comcast to see if the issue is resolved. At the time I was told that it would be noted on my account)."
"Tom of Tallahassee, fl","Sept. 27, 2011",1,"Can you give negative stars? This is about dropping internet connection. I have called them several times over the past 5 weeks to tell them their node in my neighborhood is overloaded. Obviously with no action on their part, it's getting worse. Today, from 2 am to 7 pm, my network monitoring software shows 8 outages. So what am I paying for? It's time for a class action lawsuit against Comcast. This is unacceptable, intermittent service."
"Sheena of Gary, IN","Sept. 25, 2011",1,"I have had phone and Internet through Comcast since July 2011 (about 4 months).  They sold me on their services when they stated on the phone and their Internet site that you can own your own modem and not pay a monthly service to rent theirs.  I have my own and it was on the list of modems that qualify.  However, this is not the case.  Comcast has billed me a rental fee every month since I have signed up with them.  My husband and I have both tried to resolve this matter, but Comcast refuses to stick with their 100% customer satisfaction guarantee.When we call, they are unprofessional, leave us on hold for far too long, and when they get back on the phone, it is never the supervisor or the manager that I requested.  It normally takes about three hours to even get a supervisor on the phone, and when they do finally get on the phone, they tell us that they have to open an investigation into the matter.  This has been going on for about three months and I have even taken the modem up to their office so they could verify that it did not belong to them.After they scanned it into their computer, I gave them some time and called them back (about two weeks) but they did not even have my modem in their system.  Actually, they have no notes in their account in regards to this matter.  I have made several complaints to this company in regards to their service and they do very little to resolve any of the issues.  I still have the line they ran outside hanging on by a shoelace.  I have heard about 10 different times that they need to take care of this and they will make an appointment.They actually sent someone out (2 trucks) who backed up to the pole, looked at the shoe lace real closely, and then left without even speaking to us or looking at us (it is still not fixed).  I am very frustrated and I am getting no help from this company.  I have seen many other people with the same complaints and I honestly want to start a class action lawsuit.  This company needs to be stopped!"
"Sharon of Sacramento, CA","Sept. 24, 2011",1,"They installed on time. They didn't tell me that I'd need to pay $5 more per month for their static IP address. It worked OK for 2 weeks but I started having outages. On the 2nd tech visit, the modem was replaced. After 3 more random outages, I began to really track the problem. The outages are random and the time down is random. If I power the modem off and on, I can usually restore service. If I call, the tech at the other end can ""bing"" the modem at a higher signal and the modem starts working. After doing more research on this issue, it appears that in my area, they've sold too many users for the available cable. As such, users get bumped periodically. This is a business line.Not sure if I can get out of my contract since it's now 45 days since installation. When it's up, it works as described. It just isn't up 24 hours per day as described and it's a pain to have to turn off and on the modem all the time, especially since I know I'm probably bumping someone else off."
"Steve of Jacksonville, FL","Sept. 23, 2011",1,I have had numerous issues with Comcast. My internet speed occasionally slows down to a crawl. They have sent techs out to my house but they said there was no problem with my internet speed. I have tried my wife's laptop to be sure it was not my computer and it is not.They always give me the brush off. I am computer literate and have more savvy than most of their employees.
"Ryan of Atlanta, GA","Sept. 20, 2011",1,"I only subscribed to internet with Comcast. Today, while paying my bill, I found out that they charged me $79 for only an internet connection. I called them up to ask why it's so expensive when the competition is half the price? The representative told me that I was getting charged for 2 modems and would take $5 off. I said, ""No, that's not what I am calling about. I want to know why am I paying twice with what the competition is paying?"". The person told me that Comcast upgraded my account automatically 5 months ago and now, I am getting basic cable with 22mbps internet. I don't have a television. I told him that I don't want a basic cable and just the internet and also why am I getting charged for 22mbps when my speed tests say I am only getting 6 mbps? He told me I can have a technician come to check out why I am not getting 22mbps. I told him I do not want 22mbps, I just want 6 but I want to pay my old price that I was paying for just 6 before. I never asked to be upgraded to a 22mbps cable bundle. He told me that if I were just to go on a basic internet only plan, it would actually be more expensive than $79 a month. He said there was nothing he can do to lower my price down from $80 a month for middle range internet service and he transferred me to a supervisor.The supervisor answered the phone and I repeated my problem to her again. She said the same thing that the first person had told me. If I were just to get the middle tiered internet only service, it would become more expensive than the $79 I am paying now. I explained to her that AT&T offers a 12mbps (internet only) for $40 a month and if Comcast can't compete with that, then what's the use of staying with Comcast? She then said she can't do anything. I told her, then I'll just go with AT&T. Her response was ""okay"" and hung up.Worst customer service I have ever encountered. Not the fact that they didn't lower an extreme price for internet, but the attitude they expressed felt like they hate their jobs and hate the customers."
"Paul of Greencastle, IN","Sept. 19, 2011",1,"My computer crashed as a result on September 16th, 2011. A power surge bar is installed and my hard drive is burnt. A total of 6 Comcast trucks was in this park on the 17th and Frontier was here on the 6th. Whats up? Are you gonna help this community and pay for my computer?"
"Joanne of Saint Clair Shores, MI","Sept. 17, 2011",1,"After sitting on hold for almost an hour, we finally got someone.  We explained what happened.  She was told over and over that the old computer was not wifi.  We were transferred several times.  We could not get it through anyone's head that the computer was not wifi.  this literally went on for about 4 hours with no resolution.  We were then transferred (since it was after hours) to someone in India who barely spoke English.  After another 2 hours, it still wasnŠ—Èt resolved.  About a week later, a serviceman showed up (3 hours late on a Sunday).  He finally got it up and running.  Mind you, I run an internet business out of my home.  I ended up having to refund my customers almost $1000.00 due to Comcast's inability to take care of their customers.  And to top it off, I was billed for a Sunday call!  We returned the old modem to the office.  We are still being billed $8.95 a month for a modem that was returned."
"Kevin of Forest knolls, CA","Sept. 15, 2011",1,"We have limited cable and internet.  We did not want cable.  We were told it would not save any money because they give a ""discount"" for both.  Their site does not say that.  It says $40 or $49 a month for internet, not $70 a month if you do not have cable TV.  We dropped their service."
"Macer of Chicago, IL","Sept. 15, 2011",2,"I am a Comcast business class subscriber. I used the business line for a home office in Chicago. Comcast constantly goes down. I would say that at least twice a month for the past 10 months, there is always a problem affecting the area. Since the line is leased, cancellation comes with a hearty price. When contacting Comcast it is the same story. The best one was that their DNS was down. I found this an odd reason, considering that I run a local DNS which doesn't even use the Comcast DNS. I suppose, point and click problem solver 2.0 doesn't take this into account because if their DNS doesn't work, nothing does?"
"Norine of Greenacres, FL","Sept. 6, 2011",1,"I've been having intermittent internet failure for a very long time and in June, it became much worse. Phone calls to Comcast resulted in the same instructions over and over (on the floor to pull wires and reboot over and over). Finally, there was no service. Now, service early in the morning and late at night. Today (so far), I was able to get on at 5:30 and not be kicked off.At one point, they said it must be the modem. I brought the old back to Comcast and they gave me a newer model. Then they told me it must be my router, I purchased a new one. Another time I was told it must be my cable box. I went to their place of business again and changed my cable box. I've since learned that the box has nothing to do with the internet problems. My computer tech has made many visits to my home (my cost) and kept telling me it's Comcast and that they are the worst.All reasons were eliminated and Comcast finally, on August 19, sent someone to my home to check the lines. He replaced my cable box (yet again) to the very latest version and replaced my remote. And sure enough, he determined the signal was low and suggested the first thing to try would be replacing/increasing the line from the outside box to my home. He said he would have the outside contractors come. This gentleman gave me his phone number to call him in case things don't go well. He doesn't return my calls now. Why should he, there's nothing he can do.I've called this company so many, many times because no one has showed up to fix the service. I've been misled so many times (twice told a supervisor will be calling me to correct the problem but never happened). Today, I asked someone to look at the record for August 19, the date that a Comcast representative came to my home and checked the signals from the lines and supposedly, the date that a work order was done to replace the line outside. I was told that they have no record in their computer that anyone was at my home on that date. I have a signed receipt dated 8/19/11 showing that Comcast was here. I've read so many similar complaints about Comcast and must wonder why isn't a government agency after them for misrepresentations and non-completion of services?"
"Jorge of Boca Raton, FL","Sept. 6, 2011",1,"Comcast has to be the worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. First,  their customer service is on a level to compare it to kindergartener.  Not only do they lie to their customers to their faces but they have inaccurate information at all times, not to mention they fail at doing their own job most of the times, like setting up appointments.Second, their Internet service is a piece of **, since no other words can describe this.  I have had issues with them since Adelphia turned into Comcast and still having issues to this day.  Four to five years now of unstable Internet service.  After calling for months now on a more serious note and escalating this issue to supervisors and managers, no one has yet to return my call or cared to fix this issue. In my opinion, instead of wasting the millions of dollars on advertising false service, fix your current crappy service!"
"Gale of Richmond, VA","Sept. 6, 2011",1,"My Comcast nightmare began in June 2011 and still continues. On 7/19/11 at 4:10 AM, I had no internet or phone service. I telephoned Comcast and the automated system indicated an appointment was scheduled this day, between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM. However, James indicated I would be scheduled for a tech visit between 11:00AM and 2:00 PM.After a no show, I telephoned Comcast at 2:05 PM, spoke with Tony and requested to speak with a supervisor. Shortly thereafter, a woman identifying herself as a supervisor answered and conveyed she would try to schedule a tech appointment as soon as possible because James did not place an order for today. She stated she would call back to alert me of the appointment and I gave my cell number because my home phone was not in service. At 3:35 PM, I called Comcast again after hearing nothing from the supervisor. The automated system indicated that I was scheduled for a tech visit on 7/20/11 between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM.I noticed that on 7/20/11 at 3:10 AM, I had no internet or phone service, thus my security system was also disabled. At 11:15 AM, the internet and phone service is back on mysteriously. At 11:42 AM, a Comcast tech arrived and indicated he reconfigured a wire outside and everything is working now. At 12:02 PM, the tech left. At 1:06 PM, the internet and telephone went out again! At 1:15 PM, I telephoned Comcast and spoke with Ilka, who promised to contact the tech and ask that he return to check out the problem. At 1:32 PM, the internet and phone are back on. I received no further contact from Comcast and at 10:45 PM, the internet and telephone went out again. The nightmare continues!On 7/21/11 at 4:55 AM there was no internet or telephone service. At 7:18 AM, the internet and telephone is back on. This is unbelievably egregious!On 7/22/11 at 3:20 AM, no internet or telephone service, thus no security services. At 5:44 AM, the telephone and internet is back on.On 7/23/11 at 6:05 AM, no internet or telephone service, thus no security service. At 9:17 AM, the internet and telephone is back on.On 8/10/11, I received a bill from Comcast, reflecting a bill for $129.41. Clearly not the amount quoted by Mr. Roberts via telephone contact on 8/1/11. This is getting pretty ridiculous, so I forwarded payment on 8/26/11 in the amount of $129.41. These fees supposedly cover the period of 8/17/11 to 9/16/11.One of most infuriating things that these greedy people did was they charged me $15.25 for a relocate outlet, which did not occur. The tech simply erected a plate around the wire during the site visit on 7/18/11, because he said the plate should have been erected during the initial installation in 2004.On 8/27/11, hurricane Irene hit the Richmond area and the power went out at 1:55 PM. Understandably there was no internet or cable service, but I had no telephone service either. Of course, no one at Comcast mentioned that power outages seriously affected their Comcast land line services.On 8/31/11, the power was restored by Dominion at 4:05 PM. The internet, phone & cable were working properly. At 7:11 PM, there was no internet or telephone service, which essentially cut off access to ADT Security Services. By the way, the automated system indicated that Comcast received $129.41 payment on 8/30/11.On 9/1/11 at 5:49 AM, the internet and telephone services are back on and off again at 6:21 AM. At 10:40 AM, the internet and telephone services are back on. In retrospect, I telephoned Comcast at 7:16 AM to report the problems, received an automated message that conveyed the service area was experiencing disruptions and the services would be restored soon.On 9/3/11 at 10:49 AM, there was no internet or telephone service. I telephoned Comcast to report the problems and, of course, you can only report one issue at a time. I got the automated system and it conveyed that they had received numerous requests and the wait time will be 10 minutes. The system gave the option of holding on for 10 minutes or calling back. In the meantime, I tried to call in the no telephone service issue and received a busy signal 5 times. Finally, at 11:51 AM, the internet & telephone are back on. This nightmare does not end!On 9/4//11 at 4:10 AM, there was no internet or telephone service. I telephoned Comcast at 6:16 AM, spoke with a gentleman and, while talking at 6:18 AM, the internet and telephone came back on. It is so frustrating to have to pay for such an unstable service. It is obvious that Comcast simply does not care if services are satisfactory or not.On 9/5/11 at 4:16 AM, there was no internet or telephone service. I telephoned Comcast at 4:40 AM, moved through the prompts and the automated system hung up. I called back at 5:49 AM and spoke to a gentleman who could barely speak English. I had to repeat my home telephone number three times and he asked me to repeat the issues three times. He reportedly tried to send a signal twice, to no avail. He then asked, Š—“Did you hook up the system yourself or did someone from Comcast?Š— I could not believe he asked what I thought I heard and he repeated the above. He then said he would send out a technician and I asked, Š—“So the time will probably be between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM?Š— and he conveys, Š—“Probably.Š—It was difficult and frustrating to understand this man, who fumbled through every aspect of this reporting process. In order to avoid further frustration, I conveyed that I would call back later. Hopefully, the next call will afford me the pleasure of conversing with someone who speaks and understands English, in addition to being competent. This is totally absurd!On 9/5/11 at 8:45 AM, still no internet or telephone service. I finally reached an English speaking Comcast representative named Mike. He reportedly attempted to send a signal to no avail. He conveyed that he set up an onsite tech visit for 9/7/11, between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM, confirmation #CR260880542. At 10:15 AM, the internet and telephone are back up. I called Comcast, received the automated system and I cancelled the work order for 9/7/11.On 9/5/11 at 3:00 PM, I could not access my AOL email account, MSN or Facebook. There was a reading on screen indicating, Š—“Infinity, please conduct self-installation for new services.Š— This was very alarming because I had not activated any new services. At 3:01 PM, I called Comcast and spoke with Matt, who conveyed that I was mistakenly taken off the Comcast server. Matt patiently walked me through the process and all of my connection services were restored.On 9/6/11 at 7:50 AM, the internet and telephone went out. At 10:53 AM, I telephoned Comcast and spoke with Richard, who conveyed that their system indicated that I had no signal. He said he would discuss this matter with a manager and would call back as soon as possible on my cell.At 12:16 PM, the internet and telephone services were restored. At 12:36PM, I received a call from Comcast automated system that our area had experienced problems and a site visit was set up for 9/8/11, between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM.I am finally convinced that there is nothing else to do, but seek services elsewhere."
"Hannah of Manassas, VA","Sept. 6, 2011",1,"We had already agreed for Package X over the phone but in person, she said that it's better to get Package Y.  When I said that I'm not interested in Package Y, she made her voice louder and said that I should listen to what she says first before I talk. I found that to be very, very rude.I agreed to get Package Y (which was Internet + cable), but when the cable guy came, he said that the order did not indicate that we ordered for cable TV and Internet.  He was only prepared for Internet.  Clearly, there was a miscommunication.The cable guy did not receive orders for a router, but we clearly indicated that we want a wireless connection. How can we use Wi-Fi without a router?  Monica ordered for a router.  We asked for the tracking number on Day A.  She was only able to give us the tracking number on Day B.  We tried to track our package but UPS said that they cannot track that particular number.I contacted Monica but she said that was the number that UPS gave.  Instead of helping us get the router (which was supposed to be delivered on August 31), she just gave us the customer service number.The customer service people directed me to three different people before I was finally able to talk to a person. It took them 10 minutes.  The technical service person said that according to their records, UPS could not find our address and that the router was not delivered. I asked for a tracking number and that number was different from what Monica gave us.  We tried tracking it but the package is still not trackable.  The technical service person said that the router could possibly still be in the office but she's not sure.  I should call her again tomorrow.The LAN connection is also unpredictable. Sometimes, we couldn't get a good signal.  It has caused me and my housemates a great deal of inconvenience and we are appalled by the quality of service we are getting from Comcast.We had to share one cable and take turns in using the computer when we are paying for Wi-Fi service.  We need to get in contact with our relatives and friends overseas but we cannot do that at our convenience because of the poor quality of service we are getting."
"John of Parker, CO","Sept. 3, 2011",1,"Our Internet service and phone service have gone out 7 times of the past 15 days between 1:30 and 3PM. I call Comcast and the automated system routes me eventually to a message that we are in an area that is having trouble and they know about the problem. They say they are fixing it. After 5 of these events, I spent over 15 minutes each time trying to get to a person. Once I figured out how to do that, their person told me that they had no record of our phone issues because we didn't talk directly to one of their people.The second time, I asked for a supervisor. The gal put me on hold and 12 minutes later, the phone was cut off and went dead. I called back and asked immediately for a supervisor. The guy put me on hold and the phone went dead after 7 minutes. The last time I called, I left a message in a general mailbox to have a supervisor call me.I got a message on my home phone from Gwen, even though I left the message to call my cell phone number (which I left) because I would be at work. I have called Gwen back twice and received no return calls since that time. No messages on my home phone or my cell phone."
"Louis of Fort Campbell, KY","Sept. 2, 2011",2,"I live in the barracks and the only provider available is Comcast. My internet is intermittent and the quality is horrible.I have spoken with both the call center and techs multiple times and nobody can give me a firm answer as to what is going on, because ""it looks fine to them"". I do a lot of gaming online, but can rarely do so now because of how horrible their service is.This has been going on for 5 months now and it is quite frustrating. It would be nice to get the service I am paying for."
"Christian of Santa Maria, CA","Aug. 30, 2011",1,"I had no service for three months, and I am now in their collection department. I attached my complaint to their corporate office.I signed up for phone and high speed Internet service with you guys on May 25, 2011. I have had a horrible experience from the beginning; the representative who came to my house left and did not mention his departure. I did not have a change to talk to him, or ask him any questions. I was entering into a business with Comcast on the premise that Comcast would port my number (805-938-1964) from Verizon. I wondered why I was not getting too many calls. I realized a few days later that I did not have the same phone number. I called the customer care department; I instructed them to continue my Verizon service until the number finished porting, so it would not be lost. I did the phone verification after that point-- on four different occasions. Last month, I spoke with someone who told me that the number finally ported over, and I could cancel my Verizon service, which I did. Annoyed that I had to pay service for two additional months to Verizon (paying for two service providers), I signed on the other night to pay my bill for the first time, as some of the months were refunded. I recalled the girl at the office (I went down there to scream after we were in month two) telling me that she only felt that Comcast should refund half of the fees, it did not matter that my phone was not working and paying a second service provider. At this point I knew I owed around $155.I attempted to make an online payment for the first time. When I attempted to sign in as a new user, the site informed me that I was given a temporary username and password from the guy who left my house and didnŠ—Èt have the decency to say, ""Hey, stupid IŠ—Èm done with my work, and IŠ—Èm going home."" So again, I called the 800 number to resolve this. To my shock and dismay, it turned out my account cannot be found because I have some other phone number, not the one that was supposed to be ported; 805-361-0345 is this new number that I ended up with. Again, I pleaded for someone to help this begging consumer. That time when I got nowhere, I had a great idea. I reached out to the sales team on the 800 number. I sell financial services, so naturally I realized that the sales force is some of the best employees that Comcast has. The level of empathy and accountability was awesome from your sales team the other night, and I was feeling confident that this was getting resolved. I was told that I was wrong. The number was ported over (805-938-1964), but there are some processes that need to be in order to complete the porting. I was assured by your employees that on Monday morning I would receive a courtesy call to confirm that all was complete. I did talk to that employee regarding my unwillingness to pay for a service I have yet to receive. The employee calmed my concerns. I was told that once everything was complete, all the charges would be reversed and will start up as of that Monday, when the service is finally working. I left my office and cell phone numbers. Still, I have not heard from your company. What do I have to do? How many more months will this go on? What does a consumer have to do to purchase your service? Is this how far you like to degrade people by making them beg, and take work hours out of their day to give you money? I am so insulted and turned off by your company. I am demanding resolution. I am also filing this complaint with the Federal Trade Commission so that other consumers will be protected against this sort of degrading treatment of your client’åle."
"Stephaine of Northport, AL","Aug. 24, 2011",1,"For six days, we have been without service for our business!  We have no phone, fax or Internet.  Comcast was to transfer our service to a new business but no one came when they were supposed to and they won't fix any issues.  Each person says, ""We can't help fix your problem.""  We have a senior care company and they don't want to help in getting the service back.We have incurred Internet fees by trying to find other ways to connect.  The payroll was missed since we were unable to connect to the payroll company and clients went without a care since they were unable to reach us.  We have incurred several charges for fax.  We also incurred charges to have employees to stay at the office (only for them not to show up)."
"Gordon of Boston, MA","Aug. 23, 2011",1,"I made an appointment for Comcast technician to come install the internet on 08/20, which is a Saturday. I wrote down the appointment date and time and was sure I made an appointment on Saturday, since I work Monday to Friday. On Friday 08/19, I got a call on my cellphone at work from a Comcast technician telling me he is at the door. I was so surprised because I was sure the appointment was next day. The guy had a really bad attitude and was impatient to check up the schedule per my request. Then he admitted it's the wrong day and hung up. The next day, Saturday afternoon, I stayed at home the entire afternoon and nobody showed up. Then I called the technician since I got his number on my call display earlier. I called him first time, he picked up and grumbled and hung up on me. Then I called again, he picked up and heard it was me again and hung up again. I was furious, then I called Comcast customer service. The customer service representative also had a really bad attitude and told me ""well, we don't have appointment until September. Now, do you want to keep it or not now?"". I was appalled. I have never had worst customer service experience in my life. "
"Sindhu of Houston, TX","Aug. 23, 2011",1,"I have cable and internet with Comcast. Two words for their service, ""useless and hopeless"". The single keeps going off and on and each time I call them, they can never fix it on call and will schedule a tech appointment. The appointment can never be earlier than a week away at least. So, very often, I live without TV or internet for a week at least. This happens often, but my choices are limited as my apartment complex has a tie up with Comcast. "
"Cynthia of Shreveport, LA","Aug. 17, 2011",1,"Since April 28th 2008, I have had nothing but problems with Comcast.  They are horrible and should be held to a min service level since they must have paid the politicians off to get exclusive areas.  I cannot go three days without my cable going down and the internet goes off most of the time.  It can range from just a few hours to several days, non-stop for over three years.  They suck and should lose any deal they have with the city or be forced to upgrade the crap equipment.  I am so sick of hearing that I need to pay my outrageous bill on time but they just thanked me for my patience of not getting what I am paying for.  I want the service that I am paying for.  I am going to get an attorney to file a lawsuit for non-performance and start a letter-writing campaign to the city to get rid of these idiots that are too big to know what they are doing and doesn't care about anything but money.  I would go with anyone else and I mean it, even if it went against the deal.  I hate them.  They never have enough people, never answers the phone, don't show up when they say they will, and I can't take it anymore.  I really need help."
"Stan of Powder Springs, GA","Aug. 16, 2011",1,"I had Comcast Internet, TV and landline-phone service installed in my home on 07 June 2009.  When I signed up to be serviced by Comcast, I was told that my package deal was only $119.  That included my landline, TV cable and Internet service.  However, since signing up, my bill has risen to approximately $145 and when I called to talk to the customer service representative a few days ago, he told me that my service (with tax) will rise in a couple of months to approximately $155 and again to approximately $175 in 2012.This is not what I was told and/or promised by the customer service representative when I signed up for Comcast.  Comcast blatantly lied to me about what my permanent charges would be.  Additionally, the service has experienced frequent black-outs lately for hours at a time, literally.  However, Comcast has never compensated its customers for the huge and frequent inconveniences.  If Comcast is doing this to me, just think of the hundreds of thousands of customers who are being scammed and consistently lied to in the same manner.  Anything that you and your staff can do to investigate and resolve this problem will be most appreciated."
"Patrick of Beaverton, OR","Aug. 15, 2011",1,"I'm a new Comcast customer and I signed up on March 25 for a bundle deal where I would get a $100 rebate in the form of a prepaid master card (I think). It's been so long I can't remember.According to the agreement, the rebate should have been issued in mid-July. Well, here it is mid-August and I have heard nothing from Comcast. I have however called them several times. One call was a promise for a manager to get back to me in 2 days. Well, I can assure you that never happened, no one called.So, I placed another call. This time I got an account representative named Joe who informed me I need to wait another 4 to 6 weeks. I mentioned the agreement that I remembered where I have already served the appropriate time period. And he just repeated to me, Š—“You will have to wait and that's the way these things are handledŠ—, (in a smug tone).I asked for the call to be escalated and was transferred to another manager (I guess) named Greg. If I had to say anything about Greg it would be ""he should not be in the customer service area"". He seemed more annoyed by my issue than sincere. All of this was playing out while I was watching a Comcast commercial referencing their customer promise guarantee.Well I did get another promise from Greg (after 20 minutes of arguing), where I could call him back (dare him call me?) if I did not get the promised rebate in another week. This time period has come and gone again and there is no direct contact from Comcast. The phone number he gave me was a general voicemail account. I doubt I will hear from him again.There seems to be a lack of accountability in this (and many other) organization(s). There doesn't seem to be any more of the management that champions issues. I would not recommend this company as they lack respect for their customers. I'm not saying this just because they seem to have ripped me off for $100. Not at all. It's the customer service I'm referencing.There are many more details I simply didn't explain here that indicate this. I'm also sure that somewhere up the management chain there is indeed someone that truly cares about my $130 per month that I pay (on time) each month. However, in this case it's not Joe or Greg."

"Troy of Missouri City, TX","Aug. 15, 2011",3,"For the first 3 weeks after I setup service with Comcast, I had to have about 6 techs come out to work on either my cable TV or internet service. They had to replace my 2 DVR boxes at least 5 times each because they kept replacing them with used units that still had the previous customers recording settings and recorded shows. The hard drives kept freezing up and suddenly failed. I ended up having to contact the Comcast executive customer care department, who finally had a senior level tech from a different region come out to resolve the issues. I am now without issues for about 3 weeks.My suggestion is, if you continue to have issues with Comcast, contact your customer service department and have them forward you to the executive customer care department for your area.  This group generally will take care of you."
"Mary of Forked River, NJ","Aug. 14, 2011",1,"Since May 28, 2011, I have lost my wireless internet connection at least 10 times (probably more).  It requires a service call to my home each time, usually three days after I call customer service.  Multiple times, techs have arrived and did not have the equipment to fix the problem.  This is because the service orders were written incorrectly.  Hence, another service order had to be written and another tech had to come back on another day.  This has been going on for 3 months.  And again today, I cannot access the internet from my wireless laptop.  I am using someone else's internet connection to contact you.  I give up.   How can Comcast get away with charging the high rates that they do, and not provide the service they promise?  Please help if you can."
"Maureen of West Hartford, CT","Aug. 13, 2011",1,"Internet was not working --reset modem. Home phone was not working and this was a daily issue. I called Comcast last 8/7/2011 and told them the issue. A technician was to come on 8/11/11 between 1:00-4:00, I gave them cell number and asked to be called 1/2 hour before their arrival. I called Comcast at 2:30 and said tech will be there. I called at 4:00; service was some how canceled.  Comcast could not tell me who canceled or why. They gave me a new appointment for 8/13/11, 3:00-5:00. Again, I asked them not to call home number since it does not work. Comcast called my cellphone at 3:37 telling me that tech will be there at 4:30. I asked for the tech to call my cell phone 1/2 hour before they come. I got to my house at 4:15, no-show. I called Comcast at 5:17 and was told that the tech was at my house at 3:45 and no one home. I checked my Comcast email and the tech called my home number at 3:45. This phone does not work. Now, I have an appointment on 8/16/11 (3:00-5:00). Comcast has been calling my home number since 8/10/11 even though it does not work. I am looking in to AT&T."
"Karen of Martinsburg, WV","Aug. 11, 2011",1,"We have had Comcast Internet for years.  We moved locally and decided to go with Comcast TV instead of Dish Network.  We had the Internet service transferred to our new location and added TV on May 26, 2011.  When speaking to the customer service representative in placing our order, we were told our total costs for TV would be $89.99 a month, inclusive of everything.  She also guaranteed us a 30-day no-charge if we decided to cancel.  Sounded good.  After moving and watching Comcast TV, we did not like it.  You had to jump all over the place to obtain the channels we were used to watching.  We reinstated Dish Network, just love it, and cancelled the TV service on June 7, 2011.  The Comcast tech disconnected the TV service on June 8, 2011.  When we received our first bill, it was in the amount of $316.49.  We almost had a heart attack.  We were charged for the TV  double play promotion in the amount of $89.99, then $6.95 for sports package (which we thought was included, according to the service rep), $15.95 for additional outlet service, $9.95 for HD DVR service, modem Rental of $7.00, A/O Same Trip (3@$19.95 each, what ever this is) for a total of $59.85, Transfer from Account to new account of $49.98, Installation of $39.95, installation fee discount of $29.95, taxes, surcharges and fees of $6.92, for a total of $316.49.  Over the past two months, I have contacted Comcast customer service both by phone and online.  I have talked with over 20 people.  Some could not explain the bill, some told me they had no record of our disconnect, and others told me that everything was being taken care of, all the charges connected to the TV cancellation would take two-three months to come off our bill.  Our Internet was being deducted from our checking account, as we had always had done.  The last person I spoke to was Robb on July 11, 2011.  Robb is in billing and he assured me that all payments for our Internet service had been debited from our checking account and we were up-to-date on all Internet payments.Today, I have no Internet.  I started at 7:45 a.m. calling Comcast.  I spoke to five different people, being transferred, waiting, etc.  Finally I reached a man who explained to me that we owed $303 for Internet charges from May 1, 2011 plus service charges.  Non payment is the reason our Internet was disconnected.  My fault, I did not check my back account more closely.  Nevertheless, as stated above, I spoke to more than 20 people over the past two months regarding my bill, and all told me everything was OK.   I discovered, in speaking with this customer rep, that we were being charged for Internet service (OK, I will pay for this, and would have all along), plus service calls and account transfer.  The account transfer fee we had deleted from our bill with one of the customer reps somewhere along the past two months.  I was told this was to establish a new account.  New account--$49.98 to establish a new account!  This rep gave me credit at that time, but this rep I spoke to today stated this credit should never have happened.  He explained that we now have a new account number.  Whoopee, $49.98 for someone to give us a new number.  We were the same customers, same people.  I told him this was robbery. He left this credit alone but let me know repeatedly that I was receiving this credit when I should not have.  When I questioned the service call, I was told it was to fix our Internet.  When the service rep came out to install the TV service on June 8, 2011, he messed with our Internet service and our Internet later stopped working.  The service call from Comcast the next day was because of this.   I told him I refused to pay for service that was Comcast's fault.  After over two hours on the phone, I received a deduction in the amount of $71.93, and paid my Internet account up to date.  I suggested to this rep that he speak to his supervisor and mandate that whenever a rep speaks on the phone to any customer, that the conversation be documented under that customer's account number, so other reps can have the history of the problems.  This rep said this is supposed to be done but a lot of reps just don't do it.  So I have been over two months on the phone with Comcast just to resolve an issue I was told was taken care of.  Something needs to be done, as this company has the ""GOD"" syndrome.  We in Martinsburg, WV, do not have many choices for high-speed Internet; therefore, we are at their mercy.  Their prices are way too high.  They tell you one thing and then charge you complete different.  If anyone can help the public with excessive charges, please do so.  Forty-nine dollars and 98 cents to change account numbers!"
"Sonia of Union, NJ","Aug. 11, 2011",1,"Since May, it's the second time I have had to go to their office to get a modem.  I was without phone service since I have my Vonage connected to the Comcast Internet service. I am stuck since I had several problems with service and money issues with Verizon that cost me a lot of money.  So my only choice is Comcast. As far as phone service is concerned, Comcast works very well with my Vonage service.  It's a relief that I don't have to call the Internet service provider and Vonage like I always had to with Verizon. I am annoyed that my plan went from 42 or 47 to $65 or more per month and their best excuse was that I had a promotion.  Well, that's not true.  They had never offered me a promotion and if so, that promotion was from 2008 till now.  So I found that the Internet speed is not what they advertise.I am running virus scan and defragmenting my computer drive, gone through the trouble of buying a 1.5tr external drive, and still have problems.  They gave me a promotion after I complained about the increase of my monthly and the service remains mediocre. I downloaded Norton from their website, it totally messed up my PC that I had no Internet and was on the phone for two to three hours.  I had to do a system restore because of that. My Internet speed is even slower than it was and the cost is way over anyone's budget.  Someone has to do something about these companies and their ripping off customers.  It's just not right.  There are days I have a problem checking my emails. It's faster to just check them from my cell phone. My friend had her laptop connected to my Internet (and no other PC was connected to the Internet) and she gave up because the Internet speed was horribly slow."
"Sharon of Stafford, VA","Aug. 10, 2011",1,"I shopped online for Internet providers at my new home. I found a deal from Comcast, and called to sign up for it. I took notes because I've had problems with Comcast before. The deal was for 12MB (download speed), $30 a month for the first 6 months, $45 for the next 6 months, and $60 a month after that. There was no contract, so I could quit any time.After two weeks of intermittent service, I was billed $60 per month. This is even though my bill said I was receiving 12MB download speed. I found out I was only getting 6 MB download speed. I was pressured to pay the bill for the incorrect amount. Amanda at Comcast said she could not generate a new bill for me. She told me that I would receive 12MB download speed now, but I sincerely doubt it since no one was assigned to come to our house to make it suddenly work faster from then on."
"Laura of New Hope, PA","Aug. 10, 2011",1,"I spend about $200 a month on Comcast services. My Internet access on three out of the five home wireless devices stopped working or work intermittently. Comcast wants me to spend more money with them; using new signature services to get technical support for my wireless problems. This is even though everything worked perfectly until two weeks ago.I had my laptop checked at Staples, and it connected instantly to their wireless system. The problem lies with my service to Comcast; they will not help me, unless I pay more special service fees. I resent this greatly and feel exploited by them. If I can economically change providers, I will. I also will get my technical support from Staples because I feel ripped off by Comcast. It is their equipment and their service that I am not receiving consistently, and it is not because my equipment is defective. Comcast wants more money from me to sort the problems out--no!"
"Wangzhong of Evanston , IL","Aug. 10, 2011",1,"It is the worst Internet service ever. I saw another comment from someone in Evanston complaining about Comcast, and I could not agree more. Internet sporadically becomes unbearably slow, even as I am posting this it took three minutes to load. The reason I am posting is to make sure people understand Comcast is a terrible service, and will never compete with other providers like Roadrunner. Complete and utter disappointment, luckily I only need their service for a summer."
"Dane of Goleta, CA","Aug. 9, 2011",1,"This is regarding Comcast Business Internet at our Houston office.On July 14,2011, after almost a dozen calls to our initial sales contact, Jason **, and another five more to the Comcast sales department, they finally decided to take the money. We had asked repeatedly for an uptime reliability number of 99.999% but he danced around it as he never addressed the question. I asked sales when I might receive the network CIDR information so I could begin programming a router for Houston. She said as soon as the work order gets processed, which I understood, based on prior experience, is when the installer technician goes out.On July 22, I received an email confirmation for the scheduled installation from Sharica **  at Comcast, but it contained no network information. I replied to our service deliver professional, Sharica ** and asked for out network information again.On the installation date, July 26, the technician showed up late, I have attached an email saying he should be arriving 2PM Houston time at the latest. The technician told me that cable company ran out of cable modems at the warehouse and offered to install an older model Docsis 2.0 modem. Then the next day, I received the static IP information which was left to me by the installer. I noticed it was wrong. 75.148.242.191/30, we cannot have a gateway of .192 because it is outside of the subnet, so I must again wait for confirmation from Comcast whether all the CIDR numbers I received were wrong. I postponed the network router programming.On August 8,2011, I discovered that the IP information that was given to us was way off so our router programming failed. I knew the subnet looked fishy, but I attempted to correct it myself with a broader subnet, with no success.I had no way of knowing this unless I called Comcast myself and asked for IP information again, which I did yesterday. It took a few minutes for them to gather the IP info from their gateway. I transcribed them into email. And because the IP was so different, the network hardware had to be reset and programming efforts had to restart. I am only about 20% done with that and I expect it to take another week. Aside from that they sent the billing invoice to the Houston location instead of th Goleta office.  The total amount: $443.66 which is presumable for installation, Docsis 2.0 modem and first month's rate.Lastly, since our cable modem is still the Docsis 2.0, our speed are not 50/10, but initial tests showed  it to be 25/5.I'm sure our saga will continue, but I am starting to lose my sense of humor about this and I've already filed a complaint with BBB and FCC. Sadly, this is the side effect of a greater problem : Regional ISP Exclusivity."
"Patel of Marietta, GA","Aug. 8, 2011",1,"When i called Comcast Customer Service to get connected to the internet the first time, they were really good to us and treated us really well. They promised that they have really good and fast internet service and all, but it is not even 10 days and I am facing trouble with internet services. First day when the technician from Comcast came to set up the internet, he showed us the download speed as around more than 30 mbps through speedtest.net.

"Yancy of North Miami Beach, FL","Aug. 8, 2011",1,"I signed up for a promotion around May 2011 for Xfinity's internet and my wife and I were so excited, only to find out that our internet was not working and we had to wait about 2 days later for the technician to come out and repair the modem. The technician arrived at noon on May 29, that was our anniversary. We were going to a family gathering but missed most of it because the technician was working on our modem for over 8 hours! It was late in the evening, half our day gone, and my wife and I didn't even get an explanation on why. Next, I got my first bill around late June for the amount of $283.89!! I glanced down; I had a past due balance! Naturally, I was upset and wanted to know what was going on! So I called the first agent, he was apologetic. It was an error on their part and I was receiving the wrong service. I was supposed to get 12 mbs but instead was getting 20 and I was charged $99.99 for installation! After he assured me that it was going to be taken care of, I requested them to send me a paper bill with the correction so I can pay my correct balance. No bill came and my service was cut off about a week later! Now, I was furious and called for the second time only to repeat everything I went through with the first customer agent. I asked about the notes that the prior agent left regarding our last conversation. The agent told me if I paid $26.99 today and that my credit will kick in this cycle but they needed immediate payment. So, I paid and we got the service again. No bill came yet, and I called so it doesn't seem like I'm getting the internet for free. Again, this agent explained that my credit will take care of the cycle due to reimbursement of over $100.00. I asked how much balance is due. He said for next month, I believe $59.99, not including taxes."
"Roy of Atlanta, GA","Aug. 3, 2011",1,"I am very dissatisfied with the services of the monopoly Comcast. I have no internet connection via Comcast due to incompetency of services. It uses public utility lines to provide customer service or lack there of. A tree fell in our neighborhood on Saturday. After four specific days and times, we were told a technician would be at our home to repair the lines down in the neighborhood; They did not show up. I have recorded transcripts of dates and times they were to show up. When you give a time and date, they always had some reason that the time and date were wrong. They always said they could not get to the ""chats"" or audit trails. They refused to escalate issues that they could not resolve. They don't want to identify themselves and when they did, they gave false names and errors. They credited me for four no-shows at 20 bucks a piece, but they still did not come today. They are very deceitful.They were outsourced so that the American worker is not used. Shame on them. They were not concerned that you took time off work or your employer depended on you for productivity. I have all the documentation which I can send to this agency. I have names of employees and recorded chat times and reference numbers which they said they cannot get to in trying to hold them accountable. The tree has kept others from receiving services of public trust. I think Comcast is horrible and an abuser of the public. Utility trust afforded the company to use public service lines. They were allowed to increase fees and held to no accountability from public officers when they used my tax dollars that paid for lines to get them to our house.   "
"Mark of Arvada, CO",40754,1,"My high speed internet and telephone service stopped working. When I reported the trouble, a service call was scheduled. I was then told there was an ""area outage"" and Comcast canceled my service appointment. Two days later, Comcast called to say the problem was resolved. When I reset my modem, I still had no service. I called and was told I needed to schedule a service call. The soonest it would be was three days away. I was offered the option to take my modem to their office and exchange it. When I went to their office, I received what I thought was another modem. Wrong! All they did was replace the battery. My modem was still bad. I returned this modem a second time and received another modem. The people on the activation line at Comcast could not get the new modem to work. I then called the Comcast High Speed Internet tech support number. After spending about two hours on my cell phone with the tech, my modem was finally working. I spent 4 hours of my time exchanging modems and working with techs along with using my cell phone minutes due to Comcast not being able to get my modem to work. Now a week later, I am having problems with the speed of my internet connection. I am getting 20 to 22 mbps download and 4 mbps upload. I was told I needed to have a service appointment which is scheduled for tomorrow. My internet was only working 1/2 the time. The Comcast employees are totally incompetent!"
"Mark of Richmond, IN",40752,1,"I subscribe to Comcast Internet service. Lately, I have been losing signal occasionally and also my Internet service.  I have made repeated calls about the outages with no resolution.  Today, I was told that my modem is bad. After checking with people knowledgeable about cable modems; I was convinced that it's working fine. What a bunch of losers Comcast is.   They're greedy and dishonest.  If you can get service elsewhere, I advise you to do so.  I already changed my TV to satellite service; more channels, less expensive, and more reliable service-- believe it or not."
"Eleanor of Chicago, IL",40750,0,"Comcast Internet high-speed is not high-speed at all.  It is slow and getting slower. I am paying for high-speed Internet, and not getting this service."
"Randall of Eustis, FL",40748,1,"My internet has been out for three days with intermittent service.  When I called in, I got the same script each time.  I scheduled a service visit five days out. That's the soonest available.  However, I asked for a technician to check the outside of my house sooner, maybe they could drive by to see if there is a problem outside. Yesterday when I called Comcast, they told me there was on outage in my area.  They can only come and check out the inside first. They don't check the outside first. The lame person on the phone said they couldn't send someone out to look on the outside and that I would need to keep my appointment if I wanted service.  Comcast is a horrible company with horrible customer service!"
"Gewargis of Modesto, CA",40747,1,"This company applies excessive fees and taxes; they do back charging for unwarranted repairs, tripling the equipment rental and provide fake and false promotions."
"Antonio of Miami, FL",40747,1,"Comcast is the worse service anyone can ever experience. I am unable to connect to the Internet; I get to connect for 15 minutes, then the server is not found. I reported the problem when the technicians went to my house. They said they donŠ—Èt see anything wrong; especially when the Internet happened to work at that time. I am paying for service, but it does not really matter to them. Comcast is like the government. You don't have too many choices. They do whatever they want, and you can do nothing about it if you want cable service. I have no choice. They are very unprofessional. I am going to AT&T. It has caused a lot of aggravation on my part, but they expect me to pay my bill, regardless the poor service they provide. We should all go for class action against Comcast. I hope someone will take the initiative.  I am also a victim of their business department. They made me wait for three weeks for the Internet service to be installed. I had to call them first, and they told me that they needed to do construction work to be able to provide the Internet service. They assigned a sales representative to call, Patrick **, who never cared to give me a call and tell me what was going on.  They are the rudest people I ever deal with."
"Gale of Richmond, VA",40744,1,"I had been a satisfied customer with Adelphia and later Comcast for well over 32 years. After their decision to outsource technical services and establish a complaint deterrent automated system, the level of incompetence and total disregard for customers has been a nightmare for over five years. I am a retired divorcee who survives on a restricted income and I faithfully pay Comcast $143.20 each month before the due date. In December 2010, I purchased a bundled service package with Comcast that included cable, internet, and telephone services. The contractual installer who installed the Internet and telephone equipment admitted that he was a novice which was quite evident by the length of time it took him to affix an inferior and primitive cable wiring display throughout hallway walls and floor. In retrospect, I also have ADT security services and whenever the telephone is disabled, my security services are also disabled. Since June 17, 2011, I intermittently had no telephone and Internet services for extended periods which ranged from 2 to 24 hours. Initially, I felt these problems were related to some strange power surge and was reluctant to complain. However, after experiencing 2 to 24 hour disruptions between July 11, 2011 and July 18, 2011, I requested a service call. After being placed on hold for 20 minutes, they finally dispatched a technician who arrived at 2:10PM and adjusted the wire outside and replaced the Comcast modem. He was unable to ascertain the source of the problem and left at 5:45PM. At 6:10PM, the internet and phone were off again. I have placed nine service calls, spoken with numerous supervisors, written to the CEO and the issues have not been resolved as of July 19, 2011. Thus, I am seeking restitution of fees paid for services that were not rendered. After reviewing the numerous complaints from almost every state, it is obvious that this company needs closer scrutiny and oversight. 97% of the 132 complaints received between October 16, 2010 and July 14, 2011 were related to billing practices and disruptions which are not regarding unpaid accounts.

I have now been on hold for now exaggeration. One hour and 22 minutes and still waiting. I am filling this out on the computer that still works, so far.  I wonder if they are hacking into my system and knocking it out as a way to get me to sign up for this new service. Help!"
"Lien of Snellville, GA",40731,0,"I disconnected Comcast May 2nd 2011.  I was told by a Comcast rep to return the equipments to the nearest Comcast office within the week.  So that was exactly what I did on May 3rd & got a receipt of returned equipments.  The receipt also showed the account had 2 cents credit.  I even verified with the rep at that office that I didn't owe anything.   Then later on, I received phone calls from Comcast asking for their equipments. I told them that I have proof that their equipments were returned.  They basically said not to worry.  Then I received a bill in early June charging me for unreturned equipments.  I called & spoke to yet another Comcast rep.  I was so upset.  The lady looked up my account & I was on hold a long time while she researched.  She came back at the end & told me not to worry b/c the system showed that I don't owe anything.  I asked for a confirmation email, but she said there wasn't a way for her to do that.  Then today July 7th, I got another bill same as in June!  I call Comcast again. I asked for a supervisor.  After being on hold 15 minutes the rep came back on to tell me he can't find a supervisor.  Then he connected me to Nadia.  Again I explained my situation.  She said I still owe Comcast for the modem.  I explained that I  didn't have modem owned by Comcast;  I had an old modem that was offered for free six years ago via Comcast promotion w/ Bestbuy.  When that modem died, I purchased another modem.  All with my own money.  At first rep Nadia didn't want to hear, but eventually listened.  So finally she said she would have the matter researched & removed the charge for now.  Comcast have lost me for life, & I will spread the word. "

"Sungwon of Pittsburgh, PA",40727,0,"Comcast arbitrarily changed the schedules twice without any prior notice or consultation.  They pretended that the rescheduling never happened and that I confused the dates.On June 21, I did a live chat with a Comcast assistant and disconnection of the Internet service was scheduled for June 28.  However, no one showed up on June 28!  After waiting for Comcast's technicians the whole day, I called Comcast and was told that my appointment was ORIGINALLY scheduled for July 2, not June 28.  They should be ashamed of themselves for telling such a lie. Had I been told that all of the Comcast technicians would be so busy during the high season for moving and could not help rescheduling my appointment, I would have understood the situation. However, they lied to me about the appointment. I still keep the record of the live chat stating that the appointment was originally planned for June 28, not July 2.  I think that after Comcast rescheduled my appointments, the company removed the record of the original schedule to pretend that the rescheduling never happened.Anyway, on July 2, I waited for Comcast's technicians the whole day again, but no one showed up again! When I called Comcast, I heard that this time, my appointment was ORIGINALLY scheduled for July 20!  Do I have to pay one more month because of the company's reschedule and lie?  I am moving out next week!  They messed up my moving schedule!  I was so upset so the assistant let me talk to his supervisor, who advanced the appointment from July 20 to July 5. This time, I hope to meet real human beings sent by Comcast."
"Arnold of Chicago, IL",40724,0,"Comcast called and offered to upgrade our existing internet at no extra cost. When the technician arrived, we were told that we were required to purchase Cable TV to obtain the upgrade or else the cost would be raised from $59.95 to $69.95. We refused, and the new Internet was installed, under protest, but we soon discovered it did not work. We phoned Comcast and pursued the problem for 6 hours until a new appointment was scheduled. The next technician arrived late and did not know how to fix the problem. He called another technician who removed the new equipment and attempted to install the older model. He ran out of time and so another appointment was scheduled. Comcast failed to keep that appointment. The internet still does not work and we are again calling Comcast to no avail. "
"John of Antioch, CA",40718,0,"In April of this year, we saw a Comcast ad on television for Internet 2Go for $19.99 a month for six months. So I went online to order it. I was told that we would have to pay $40 a month, that the $19.99 deal wasn't available to us, I reluctantly agreed, stating as long as it was only $40 a month, the service rep said it would be, and proceeded setting it up. There was no mention of any roaming charges that came with the deal. My bill, before I ordered this service, was around $145 a month for cable, internet and the un-returned equipment charges they have been doing for over 5 years. When the May bill arrived, it was $260 plus a $60 roaming charge. I payed it. My June bill is $334, $110 roaming charge. I terminated the service, today June 24.I have been paying the different amounts of the un-returned equipment charges for over five years if not longer. My wife is on SSI, and can't afford to pay these high prices for basic cable, digital converter and remote and internet."
"Richard of Miami, fl",40717,0,"Comcast's Internet services has the worst customer service I have ever dealt with.  It all started 3 weeks ago when a contractor doing work at my neighbor's house (where the Comcast utility box is located) cut the DSL line which goes from the Comcast box to my house.  Since then, I have spoken to Comcast's customer service department over 15 times.  They have sent out 7 different technicians and I still have the same problem.  Their cable line has not been buried and has run over my fence and through my deck. The latest situation happened earlier this week.  We had an appointment for a ""line crew"" to come out and bury the line on Tuesday, 6/21.  O crew showed up on Monday, took a look at the problem and said that they would return on Tuesday, 6/21, to do the actual work.  I called Comcast on 6/21 at noon, 5:30pm and 8:00pm as nobody from Comcast showed up or called.I was told on all 3 calls that I had an open ticket and that a tech would be at my home by 9pm.  When nobody showed up, I called Comcast again at 9:30pm and was told my appointment was rescheduled for Wednesday, 6/22.  My wife took another day off from work on Wednesday.  We called Comcast at 12:30pm, 5:15pm and 7:30pm and we were told that a tech would be arriving by 9pm.  I called back at 9:30pm when nobody from Comcast showed up and was told that the tech called my cell phone at 7:00pm to reschedule for today, 6/23.Of course, this was totally false, a lie.  When I pointed out that I called after 7:00pm, was told I had an ""open ticket,"" and that a tech would be out by 9pm, the customer service rep apologized and did not have any further information for me except that they would be out today between 9am-9pm.  He also said his ""supervisor"" would call me (last night) with an explanation.  Of course, nobody called last night. Today, I spoke with a supervisor of the department, which is supposed to come out to my house for the job.  He had no explanation and said that it appears the job has been rescheduled for tomorrow, 6/24.  When I complained ""loud enough,"" he said he would have someone come out today.  They are supposed to call me prior to coming; however, I won't hold my breath.  Unfortunately, I don't have any other DSL options where I live or I would have switched providers a long time ago.  If you are considering ordering Comcast Internet services, do yourself a favor and don't do it!  They are horrible."
"Jon-Paul of Middletown, NJ",40715,0,"Comcast is upgrading their network to provide consumers a better experience. This upgrade will cost consumers an additional $7/month. While I am not sure of the details of the upgrade, I suspect that the upgrade will benefit Comcast by enabling compression or other bandwidth savings, or provide better management or some other angle that directly benefits Comcast. This is the second 'upgrade' they performed that wound up costing consumers more. The first one was when they changed the signaling inside consumerŠ—Ès homes. Before they did that, I was able to receive HDTV signals on any of my sets, and I didn't need a set-top box. After the upgrade, a set-top box is required (at a monthly cost). Which branch of government is responsible for allowing these large monopolies to continue to raise prices like this?"
"Namita of Hayward, ca",40695,0,"I had a business account with Comcast. I sold my business on March 28th and I called Comcast and terminated the service in January. I started receiving phone calls from Comcast in April that there is a balance owed on the account. The first call I received was the end of April. When the representative told me there was a balance owed, I got ready to give him my credit card info for the payment. In the middle of the transaction, he mentioned that he apologizes for the call and there is no payment owed on the account. He looked through the records and saw it in the notes that the balance to date has been paid. I was glad that they figured it out and end of conversation. I received another call the very next day from another representative and he said the same thing that there was a balance owed on the account. I told him at the time that I spoke with someone the day before and at the end of our conversation I was told that there isn't any balance owed. I asked the second representative to read through the notes before we go any further. At the end he told me the same thing. He apologized for the phone call and said there was no balance owed. I offered to do a payment anyway and if there is a reimbursement, I'd rather wait for that rather than get something reported on my credit report. The representative assured me that won't happen and clearly everything is documented on my account history. I also told him that I didn't appreciate the phone calls and he said I will receive one more phone call because of the automatic system they have and I could just ignore the call. I didn't receive any call after that. On May 31st, I received a message on my phone that I have a charge on my credit through a collection agency. I called the collection agency right away to find out what the charge was. It was a charge off from Comcast for the same issue. I know the collection agency could only take the payment and I had to resolve this matter with Comcast, so I gave my credit card information to ER Solutions and paid the settlement. The representative asked me to call 14 days later to receive a debt release letter. Today, June 1st, I called Comcast to talk to someone about the misinformation I was given. I was on the phone for 40 minutes and spoke with 2 representatives. The first representative (Stan) told me that even if I cancel my contract, it takes 60 days before the cancellation; so I still owe for the months I didn't have service. I told him that that was not the issue; the issue is the misinformation I was given and the fact that this will be reported to my credit. Stan transferred my call to another department and I then spoke with Larry. Larry told me that I have to talk to the collection agency regarding this matter. I insisted on speaking with the manager. The manager related the message through Larry that they clearly see there was an error. The business contract with Comcast was supposed to be terminated January 19th but the clerk entered the wrong date of April 18th. Therefore, they kept billing me and all the charges accrued on this closed account. At the end of our conversation Larry told me that this will be taken care of by the end of business date tomorrow and now I have to wait 30 days for a refund from the charge I paid to the collection agency.I work full time and I pay my bills on time. I work very hard to maintain good standing on my credit. I sold my business in March and I'm still dealing with Comcast on an account that was supposed to be closed in January when it's June now. They told me that this would not be reflected on my credit but because they have consistently misinformed me, I don't trust what they tell me anymore. They have harassed me with phone calls and had me on the phone repeating myself over and over explaining what had happened. Clearly Comcast does not care for their customers. The result out of this whole situation is that they made a bad reflection on my credit rating. I would ask Consumer Affairs to look into ComcastŠ—Ès complaint ratings and how efficient they are processing they're customers requests. They clearly need training to process the transactions efficiently and accurately. I spoke with over five representatives and they all assured to correct their mistakes but they haven't so far. I will be contacting them again to make sure they resolve this issue."
"Joseph of Memphis, tn",40690,0,"Last summer I installed a Comcast internet and television system at my home. The first technician came out and strung wire and put in a modem box with a splitter for the TV. The system worked for about a week and then we started losing the signal. I called them back and the tech said we needed a power booster, so we did that, it worked for a while then trouble again and another technician ran new wires from pole to house, said I didn't need the power booster and fixed it for a while then same issue no service. Comcast has a communications system that's partially automated that will dump you if your number appears to have issues assigned to it or one minute you will be chatting with someone in Knoxville and the next in Mississippi they call it "" call sharing "" I call it caller dumping. I have spent more than 40 hours chatting with all kinds of customer service people and have been told conflicting information by all of them.Later in the year they brought me a new modem but failed to register it as I was talking with joy in Nashville she said the modem was not on file so we added it. Two days later I chatted with Melissa in Nashville and she said it was not on file so we put it on again. I wanted to speak to a supervisor on Thursday May 19th and I chatted with Ryan in Knoxville, he promised that a technical supervisor from Memphis would call me and IŠ—Èm still waiting.On Monday May 23 after a good chat with Carla in Memphis she sent out a technician and the Germantown Collierville technical supervisor Carolyn ** who did a fine job trying to fix my issue. She even followed up the next day to try and fix the issue. The afternoon after she and the tech left I could not log on so the new box the 3rd one in a year would not let me on I talked with tech support which is in the Philippines three different times and finally got back on Tuesday May 24th.On Tuesday evening finally totally fed up with Comcast I ordered an ATT DSL internet system and it arrived the next day and I hooked it up and it has not faltered at all. On 5-26-11, I contacted the corporate office in Pennsylvania and chatted with a staffer who said someone from the local office would be calling me and that hasn't happened either. I have heard every false bit of misinformation one can hear from Comcast."
"Tony of Sycamore, IL",40673,0,"I subscribe to Comcast cable internet. I do not want to receive emails promoting their programing or packages. For the last year I have tried to get them to stop sending the unwanted emails. I call, email and opt out usually every other month when the emails start. My last complaint, they suggested that I set up an email filter to block their unwanted email. I was even given instructions.In the past, I told them I no longer wish to use their email, and asked them to lower my internet bill. They thought I was joking. My history with Comcast is not good. When I moved, it took almost 10 hrs on the phone to get my service right. They tried to charge me for my modem, they claimed it was theirs. I tried the digital cable. I had to take the digital box back because I was sent letters threatening to raise my rates if I didn't sign a paper that I assumed I'II had already signed when I got the box."
"Alisyn of Sacramento, ca",40666,0,"My Internet stopped working.  My husband called customer ""no"" service to get some help, but the guy couldn't help.  So, my husband requested a tech come out to our house to take a look at it.  After much arguing, the tech finally scheduled the appointment for 5/3/11 between 8-10 am.  My husband requested the day off and we received automated calls and emails reminding us of the appointment.  We confirmed with the automated phone call that we did want to keep our scheduled appointment.  On 5/3/11, at 7:59 am, my cell phone rings.  My husband went outside to see if the tech was out front to let him know we were home, but no one was there.  I check my voicemail, it says, ""This is Comcast calling regarding your appointment, call to reschedule.""  What?I called right back and was on the phone with a rep.  I was told that I had to reschedule since I didn't pick up the phone.  It was 8:06 am.  Really?  Wow!  We were livid!  I asked to speak with a supervisor and was put on hold for 10 minutes.  And then the same rep came back on the phone.  She never got a supervisor and just repeated what she had said prior.  I asked to be transferred to a supervisor again and she blind transferred the call to another rep, not a supervisor.  I had to repeat everything I had already discussed with the previous rep.  So, after much arguing, I was finally transferred to a supervisor (it was after 9 am by this point, one hour into the phone call) who stated that my appointment wasn't cancelled and they would still be there by 10 am.  10:30 am hits, still no call, and no tech at my house.I called again and spoke with Surel who stated that the appointment had been cancelled.  What?  I was done!  I asked him to cancel my service.  I don't pay over $70 a month for Internet service just to be treated like this.  So he put me through to Bobby.  Bobby was very apologetic and friendly and even understanding.  He offered me an appointment for the same day from 2-4 pm and a $20 credit and $15 off my bill for the next 12 months.  I told him that was fine, but I was going to talk to my husband about still cancelling, and he understood.Well, so far, it is 3:58 pm and no call.  I guess we got cancelled again without us knowing.  My phone hasn't rang once, so they have two minutes to give me a call or they are going to get dropped.  I can pay $70 to someone who needs it and will value me as a customer.  Poor customer service.  Do not use them, they are awful!"
"Drew of Lakewood, CO",40647,0,"My dad and I live together and have been subscribing to Comcast for roughly 2 years now. Originally, our service was just fine. No problems. Now, it is the exact opposite. I believe it started in January when the internet would cut out every morning at 2 am. It did this every single morning. I called Comcast to let them know of the trouble and that it was an issue for us, since we would use the internet at that time of the day. The customer support representative said that it was a very simple issue. She said Comcast was sending updates to the router and modem and for whatever reason, the updates weren't making it from the modem to the router. Her suggestion was to simply reset the modem and router every time the Internet cut out. That suggestion seemed a bit non-caring and ridiculous. I shouldn't have to power cycle my equipment every time I want to connect to the internet. Then the disconnections started happening more frequently, especially during the nighttime hours. Every time the Internet would disconnect, the phone service would shut off too. I called Comcast again and complained that we can't use services we are paying for. I told the customer service representative that I was calling from a payphone, since their phone service was too unreliable to carry on a conversation. And all calls would cut out after a minute or two.The representative confirmed that it wasn't a problem with our router, since the phone service doesn't even go through it. The representative also said they would send a technician out to check the modem and the cable line. Then the technician replaced all the line from the pole to the house, replaced some splitters, and replaced our modem. She also found a problem we didn't know we were having. When she connected her device up to our cable line, she said we weren't getting all the TV channels that we were supposed to be getting. We hadn't noticed this, since we don't watch that much TV. After she replaced the equipment, she did another test with her device saying she noticed a drastic improvement but admitted that the signal was still not in proper specs. Since the internet appeared to be working at that moment, she left saying to call Comcast if we had any further issues. Sure enough, the problem came back immediately. The next tech Comcast sent out checked everything, replaced some cable lines inside the house, and left. Nothing he did fixed the problem. Then one of our many TV boxes quit working altogether and wouldn't pick up any stations. Comcast sent a tech to replace that and to try to check on our internet problem. The technician replaced the TV box and got the TV signal working again but wasn't able to do anything for the internet.I called Comcast to complain again. At this point, they offered me 6 months of Showtime for free. That was meaningless to us, since we hardly watch TV and it in no way helps the internet problem. A discount on our bill would have been more appreciated. At this point, Comcast told me they would send out a field tech, since the regular techs couldn't solve the problem, and that he would definitely be able to solve it. The field tech came out and seemed to understand exactly what the problem was but not what was causing it. He decided to rewire the inside yet again. When doing so, he felt voltage running through the line. I felt the lines and sure enough, it was comparable to a strong 9V battery. He immediately said he was done there and that we were causing the problem ourselves. He said our house wasn't properly grounded and that we were feeding voltage back into the system thus causing our own problem. How he was so sure of this, I don't know, since he did not use any devices or equipment to confirm this. We were charged $40 for that tech to come out. After his visit, we had all the outlets properly grounded and tested the ground to make sure it was a good ground and worked properly. It did. Since our internet problems had been progressively getting worse, I called Comcast again. And again, they sent out a technician. This tech appeared to have the best understanding of the problem. After giving him a history of the problem and what had been done thus far, he watched the modem lights and confirmed we had a real and serious problem. He said he would go outside and test the line to see whether or not we ourselves were sending voltage and noise back into the system. That is a test that the field tech should have done but didn't.After he finished his test, he confirmed that our house was not causing any noise and there wasn't any voltage feeding back in the line. He then told us that the problem was being caused by one of our neighbors. He said that one of their houses was creating high voltage and feeding noise into the system. He apologized for the fact that he wouldn't be able to fix it right away and said to give him 2 or 3 days to isolate which house was causing the problem. He gave us a cell number and said to call him directly if we were still having problems after that. Two days later, the problem appeared to be fixed. A couple more days later, the problem came back fully. We called the number several times and left a message but never got any call backs. That was not surprising. I called Comcast, and they said they knew nothing of it and that according to their map, our neighborhood was just fine. This was in contradiction to what the representatives had told me in earlier phone calls. On more than one of my previous calls to them, the customer support representative had checked their area map and said ""yes"" that they can see that there are some service issues in the neighborhood area.So basically depending on who you talk to, they will either admit or deny a neighborhood-wide problem. Eventually the last representative I spoke to apologized and said there was nothing that Comcast could do at all. She did not offer any sort of compensation or any discount on our monthly bill, even though she admitted we weren't getting proper service. I explained that I was thinking of switching to Qwest for internet service, and the representative told me that that would not help. She told me that Qwest uses the same lines and poles and that even if I switched over to them, we would continue to have this same problem. At that point, I decided to wait just a little longer before cancelling services. As of now, we have cancelled our TV and phone service but still subscribe to internet. Our problem still exists. I don't know what to do. Also, in the past week, aside from the random disconnects, our speed has dropped significantly. We are paying for the 20 Mbps service, and as of a few weeks ago, we were getting that with an average of 23 Mbps. Now, the best we can get is 3 Mbps. The slowest speed Comcast offers on their website is 15 Mbps. So something is clearly wrong.I don't know what to do anymore, and I get the distinct impression that Comcast is taking advantage of us and doesn't care as long as we keep paying the bill. Is there no law that requires them to keep their end of the agreement? We can't afford to pay $40 every time we need a tech out here, which is always."
"Victor of Baltimore, MD",40647,0,"I contacted Comcast /Xfinity, to get their triple play service on December 19, 2009. I talked to Alesia ** and she set up for a pre-post for Sunday January 3, 2010. The tech came out said he needed to get to the basement of the apartment building I was moving into. We set for someone to comeback on the following Thursday, the 7 of January. That tech said the basement was flooded. He said he would need to put in for a construction permit to dig a trench from the apartment to the end of the building. I found out they were subcontractors for Comcast, this was on January 21, they did not notify Comcast. I called Comcast that day and told them what their subcontractor told me. I then told them I needed my Internet by the 1st of February. They could not guaranty it, so I told them I'll vet phone and Internet from someone else until they could get me hooked up.Every month, I'd receive a call from Comcast saying they were sending someone out to book me up, no show. That continued for months. A costumer service rep. named Bob contacted me to set up for a tech to vet me hooked up. That was in July of 2010. In August, a tech came out and split service of the apartment from above me just temporary, supposedly, so I would have the triple play. The phone and TV worked well, but my high speed Internet was slow and would kick me off line within minutes to no more then an hour of being online. I called Comcast letting them know I was having problems with the Internet. I thought it was the Norton Security was doing it. I forgot my hook up was split from another apartment. Weak signal or weak stream coming into the apartment plus split 3 ways to go to 3 TVs. I called Comcast Sunday, the 3 of April 2011. They set up for a tech to come out Tuesday the 5th of April 2011.I showed him the so called temporary hook up and let him do his test on my computer and he checked the dream/signal from the split outside of the apartment and said they need to do the pre-post to get me the proper stream/signal to come into the apartment. I was told it won't be done overnight. He seen from prior paperwork that the prepost was originally scheduled in July of 2010. He then called Comcast and put in for the proper prepost again to be done. I had to call Comcast every time I got on my computer to try to see what could be done about my lack of Internet stability and why was I still being charged for a service. I've been billed for and not receiving. I was then told they would credit me for a month that I first said it was due to Comcast not having me hooked up properly. And that I had to wait for them to solve the problem before they could credit me. Ever since I called them, my Internet service is getting worse. I've done drugging they told me to do from deleting the cookies, cache, to resetting the box to doing Norton massive computer clean up of spy and adware scans, which showed there were no viruses. I was calling a lot since the 3 of April. They say it will be 2 weeks before a date for them to get come to do the digging of the trench for the prepost will be set and don't know how long it can take for that date to actually take place. I now have an even harder time to vet on line and stay than I did prior to me having complain and the tech come out to let them know what the problem was. This is the reason why I am putting in a complaint on Comcast/ Xfinity."
"Kenneth of Sterling, MI",40632,0,"My name is Kenneth ** and I am the President of a fairly large electrical contracting company that currently resides in Worcester Massachusetts. The name of our company is New Horizons Technologies Inc. The current address of our company is in Worcester, but we have recently purchased a new place of business that is located at ** in Sterling Massachusetts. We closed on this new property on November 19th, 2010. Since purchasing this property, we have completely renovated it, bringing the office space up to date, improving the exterior of the buildings and upgrading all of the utilities, and systems at this location. We have basically taken an old historic former rail station, then Lumber yard and brought it back to life with a new found character and meaning to the town of Sterling and the neighbor hood it is located in. When done we will have spent over Four Hundred Thousand Dollars on this place to make it a modern, functional, thriving place of business.The Town of Sterling has been wonderful to deal with including the Building Departments, Inspectional Services, Fire Department, and local utilities. They have been very accommodating and a pleasure to work with. They understand the value of a company like us moving in and updating a property such as this and what it brings to the community. Us moving into a location like this adds value to all of the real estate around us because of how we increased the value of this property, it helps the other local businesses in the area with increased volume of business because of the 70 employees we bring to the area to do business in that area. We hope to continue to grow and provide opportunity for additional hires from this area to add to our work force.This Recession and current economy have been very hard on small businesses like ours as you very well aware. I have been doing this for over 23 years now and this is by far the worst period I have ever seen. To be honest, I am not even sure our business model even works now with the new set of rules that are out there to compete in this economy, but we are trying our best to survive and to make it to the end of this period. We actually had a decent 2010 so , we decided to invest in property and to stop renting and hopefully 2010 was an indicator of things to come. So we bought the property in Sterling and hoped to make this our new home to take us into the next decade and help with setting us up to be prosperous into the next decade.The purpose for this letter is to inform you, and also ask for your help in dealing with Comcast. We have electricity, we have gas, we have phone service, but we have no internet service. The only player in town is Comcast and our hands are tied. We can only deal with them. We first contacted them on February 28th, one month ago today. We are planning on moving into our new office this Friday April 1st at the close of business on that day and opening for business on Monday April 4th. They are now telling us we will not have internet service for approximately another 3 weeks. We have documented all phone calls and internet dealings with them. They have been totally slow, unresponsive, and non-caring about our situation. Basically treating us like a number and could care less about our situation. I have no idea if there are more complaints, many complaints or no complaints about Comcast and their service, but I feel I needed to write you and every other person in politics and the media who might listen. I have been totally shocked to find out that it takes 6 to 8 weeks to get internet service to a business line ours in the town of Sterling. We deal with municipalities all the time. Getting power, telephone and internet service for our clients. We know the routine, we know the pitfalls and the steps needed, but dealing with Comcast has been the worst. Just totally unresponsive to our needs and time frame.They need to run a cable 700 from where it is currently dead ended on the street. They say that is one of the reasons they cannot do it quickly because they need to schedule that part to get that wire strung on the poles. The other is they say they need a police detail. I tell them that we know what it takes to string a cable 700, and we know what it takes to get a police detail and both can happen very easily with a little bit of effort. They do this every day all day. They prefer to put up barriers instead of removing them. They prefer to stop business instead of helping it.Basically, I read all the time about how politicians talk about providing jobs, helping small business to succeed, to provide an atmosphere where businesses can prosper so they can hire new employees. Everyday I see on the news how it is so important to get America back on its feet, to get people back to work, to buy properties and help out neighbor hoods they are located in. To get the most important segment of our industry hiring again, which is small businesses. Well, here is a perfect situation. We have done everything with out no kick backs or buy outs from the governments, no tax credits and no assistance what so ever. I just need Comcast to give us internet service. They were given this monopoly by our government and now they stand in the way of business progressing. This is just not right. We are not a 100 billion dollar bank, insurance company, or car manufacturer, we are an 8 million dollar a year small business trying to survive.Technology is so very important to our business and every business out there. I keep hearing that the government wants the internet brought to every household in the country. Well, we use it and need it and cannot run with out it. The impact to our business is in the tens of thousands with out it. If the government is going to give these companies a monopoly in these towns, the government needs to apply pressure to these companies when they are not serving the good of the community.Hopefully there is something that can be done here. Business as usual with Comcast needs to stop. Maybe we cannot be helped, but others may be able to be in the future."
"Jeffrey of Laurel, MD","Feb. 19, 2011",0,"I called Comcast to schedule an appointment to have internet installed on 2/17 between 5 and 8 p.m. On 2/17, I received a call at 4:00 p.m. and I informed the technician that I would be home at 5 p.m. I arrived at 4:45 but no one ever showed up. I called them at 9:30 p.m. and they rescheduled for the following day. They didn't offer any compensation until I said I will just go with Verizon. I talked to 4 different people who put me on hold for long periods of time and finally rescheduled and was compensated with 50 dollar credit. On 2/18, I arrived home at the same time and was scheduled for an appointment between 5 and 8 p.m. I received a call from Comcast trying to sell me other services. I never received a call from a technician and no one showed up.I then called Comcast and was again put on hold for long periods of time. I then spoke with a gentlemen who told me a previous tenant had defaulted on their bill so I would have to show proof of SSN and other documentation. This has been one of the most frustrating ordeals in my life. Everyone gave me different answers and put me on hold. And never did anyone tell me I had to provide a copy of my SSN and other documentation. This is the worst customer service I have ever seen in my life. I am now out over 100 dollars of lost work pay and several hours of frustration waiting for them to install. And then to be told I need documentation because a previous tenant defaulted. This is pretty sad that a large established company can treat people this way and get away with it. I hope there is something you can do to help me. This will be very much appreciated."
"Olga of Jersey City, NJ","Feb. 8, 2011",0,"I contracted high speed Internet from Comcast more or less three weeks ago. When the technician came to install it, he said there was no Comcast service in that building and that they shouldŠ—Ève told me that. He also said this is the third time he came to my building with the same problem, that Comcast never installs the box in the basement to provide service to the building. Why then does Comcast allow you to do all the process and nobody told you? Well, probably it is due to the incompetence of that company. But the worst is that I already bought a router and a modem ($114) from them and since two weeks ago nobody is answering my mails or my calls to put a solution to this problem. Where are the good service and the respect for the costumers? Even the Rich Germano group is answering my emails.I just want an answer and my money back! I spent $114 in a modem plus router, but itŠ—Ès been one month without Internet. That means IŠ—Èm paying Netflix for nothing and at least 4 calls per day leaving messages to an answering machine."
"Steven of Beaverton, OR","Dec. 7, 2010",0,"   Sadly I've been cursed with 8 years of living in regions of Oregon that have only 1 high-speed Internet provider: Comcast.  My complaints are many, but can be boiled down like this:First off, they charge an ""installation fee"" which typically costs about as much as 1.5 months worth of Internet.  So even if you start on their service with the typical 6-month promo, they've already walked off with a substantial part of the anticipated savings.  The last time I moved, the installation wasn't done properly and it took an hour on the phone with Customer Service to get it solved {they still had to charge me full price for the originally botched installation though}.They charge monthly rental fees on their cable modems which they just toss into bins when you return them...no wonder my first cable modem from them only worked for an average of 6 hours/day.When I tried to set-up auto-withdraw to pay the bills, they managed to set it up so all the bills got paid a month late.  Then they started calling to say my bills were overdue and I'd point out that was impossible beings it was on auto-bill pay.   They'd agree & promise to get it fixed...I guess it resolved fast because it only three months of calls back & forth to finally get it reset properly.As soon as an alternative service became available in my area last year, I changed.  I noticed instant improvements: the new service was just as fast, 20% cheaper, free installation (properly installed), and they gave me a FREE wireless router to support 4 wired-computers (previously I'd had to buy my own router because Comcast's cable modem had exactly 1 slot for a computer, no wireless support).Beings they now had a local competitor, Comcast started a ""fear"" campaign by mail & billboard pointing out that this new company was ""going leave it's customers hanging"" and they were offering ""special rates"" to anyone changing back to their service. That was a year ago and I couldn't help but laugh when I heard last week that Comcast was raising it's rates (again).  Apparently it's costs are going up (their CEO just needs that extra little Christmas bonus probably).  Somehow, my new service is doing just fine with it's current rate (which is comparable to what I was paying 4 years ago with Comcast)."
"Jo of Seattle, WA","Nov. 11, 2010",0,"Apparently I suddenly needed an upper case letter in my 'safe' password. Why? Only Comcast knows; this meant of course that my windows 'memory' of my password had to be changed. All this, for what? It's always, always, from Comcast with no explanation. They are apparently run by people who don't really give a **** about their customers - just the money.  Any lawyers reading this? I speak hypothetically, of course. I worked for doctors & lawyers before I retired. Guess what? Along with the majority of people, I am ashamed of most of you."
"Laurie of Glen Allen, VA","Nov. 10, 2010",0,"My internet and phone service keeps coming and going.  I called yesterday and they checked the line and said that the modem had reset itself 26 times in two days and said that I needed service.  They said that they would send someone today 11-2.  The automated message called four times prior to the visit to confirm that I still needed the service.  I waited but no one showed up and about 1:00, I am getting automated voice mails to rate my service.  The problem is that no one ever came.  I did an online chat but that person was useless and had no idea why it happened or if someone was coming or not. I called at four and they just said sorry and rescheduled me for tomorrow, same time.  I complained and said that I was not waiting all day and give me a one hour time block when they would show up.  He said, impossible, then I said to put me on the phone with the supervisor.  I spoke with Reggie then he said that he will give me 8-11 tomorrow but don't know if he can do anything.  I told them to give me the first appointment and we shall see.  Needless to say, I am pissed.I want to cancel but, of course, that takes research and time to get a new service.  They totally act like they have no control and don't care.  How hard is it to actually call whoever is scheduled to come and communicate?"
"Gary of Aventura, FL","Nov. 10, 2010",0,"My wife called at 8AM and was put on hold listening to music until 9AM.  She lost an hour of wages because nobody came back on the line.  If they can't be in the service business, then they should get out.  We are a long-standing customer of Comcast and expect some remuneration for her time lost.  It seems that the bigger they are getting, the worst the service."
"Stephany of Aventura, FL","Nov. 8, 2010",0,"I haven't had internet service for the past three months and still received a bill. I became delinquent because I refused to pay if I didn't receive service. My cable went out, so I havenŠ—Èt had TV for two weeks. I called today and was rejected from the automated machine because my area code is from a different state. I was transferred about eight times, which is seriously irritating. And I had to repeat my complaint along with account number four times. All I got was the run-around and the last time I was so livid I started crying and the representative hung up on me after I spent 40 minutes on the phone wasting my time and having accomplished nothing. So I am still delinquent. I still have service since nothing was cancelled or even done. I don't even want to call anymore because IŠ—Èll blow up if someone transfers me again. "
"Rubeya of Irvington, NJ","Nov. 8, 2010",0,"After having a scheduled appointment (land line and internet install); they refused to have their technicians visit my home without me having a functional contact number. I waited for a technician for over 4 hours without a visit to my home. I contacted Comcast employees and were given a twenty dollar credit, without a visit. Note: no call and no show. Total mental damage due to lack of customer service and Comcast breaking verbal agreements. "
"Tom of Lisbon, CT","Nov. 4, 2010",0,"I'm paying $54.95 per month for Comcast's ""Blast"" cable Internet service, which is supposed to be 16mbps. This was the case until approximately 2 months ago, when the speed suddenly dropped to around 3 to 5 Mbps.I've made several calls to Comcast's tech support for assistance without any success. One tech support person (Stephanie), who obviously didn't know what she was doing, got frustrated and hung up on me. A technician made a house call, but said that my service was as good as everyone else in the area was getting, even though I did several speed tests while he watched, which confirmed my claim of slow connection speeds.I also went to a couple of websites which loaded web pages slowly, but he still claimed that, according to his wi-fi meter, my connection was fine, and there was nothing he could do. After calling tech support several more times, I was told that Comcast couldn't do anything about the problem, and they wished me good luck with it."
"Andre of Miami, FL","Nov. 1, 2010",0,"My internet connection has been going out for over a year and just got a lot worse in August. My connection went down every single day for 2-3 weeks. There have been 6 technicians that came out but none have been able to help. Every time I call they just want to send a tech. Then by the time the tech comes out everything is working, so there is nothing they can do.Since I work from home, this has caused me to lose quite a bit of money and have been suspended from employers. Today I started training for a new job and I cannot miss a day of class or I will be disqualified, and my connection keeps going in and out, which caused me to lose 3 hours of training. I am now waiting for a response from the trainer to determine if I will be allowed to continue training tomorrow. I have lost $2,711 over a year as a result of hours I have lost because of Comcast."
"Bamberger of Dillsburg, PA","Oct. 29, 2010",0,"My Comcast bill for internet and cable was 190.00 a month. My buddy has Comcast internet and all cable channels plus HD and phone, all for 87.00 a month so I called to complain. I got my bill dropped to 105.00 a month, just internet and cable. To my surprise, my internet no longer worked. Two days later, still no internet and no quick fix in site. If you're smart, you will run from Comcast. They don't have customer service and nobody wants to help when they screw up."
"Jan of West Palm Beach, FL","Oct. 25, 2010",0,"Just the worst customer service and lack of taking responsibility for their mistakes I have ever seen. As a new customer initially for internet and cable, the screw ups began with late for the installation and over billing were somewhat fixable but clearly a pain in the **. Now comes the migration to their phone service because my soon to be ex-wife wanted the phone services out of her name. Thus migrating the home number from T-Mobile home service to Comcast. I gave Comcast 10 days notice and informed T-Mobile of the transition. Comcast was called 3 times to confirm the transfer of the number from T-Mobile to Comcast. All three times, everything was confirmed for a transfer on the date of installation. When the service technician showed up with the new modem he had an entirely new number and knew nothing about the old number that was to be used. Subsequent calls to customer service and being put on hold for over 35 minutes only resulted in an insincere, ""Gees... were sorry,"" and the fact that they never did what they said they were going to do. It will take 5-10 days for them to contact T-Mobile and make the change. There was/is no making up for their mistake and no promise that they will get the job done as promised. These ** guys suck and if you have a choice for other providers in your area, use them."
"James of Shelton, ct","Oct. 20, 2010",0,"Over the past year, I have made no less than 20 service calls by phone for a variety of problems.  On several occasions a repairman was sent with mixed results and a variety of reasons for loss of service.  Lately the audio from the cable TV has been dropping out.  This loss of audio has been happening every few days.  I have to regularly reboot the system, on the average of once a week.  No one has been sent to really look into this chronic problem.  Comcast is always quick to apologize and has offered some credits to my account on occasion.  Neither their apology nor the credits make up for an inferior system and very poor service.  I do not have experience with any other company at this point in time.  If you are looking for a problem and some frustration, select Comcast as your provider!"
"Michael of Ocala, FL","Oct. 19, 2010",0,"At the end of September 2010, I relocated from Michigan to Florida, and gave Comcast advance notice. I wanted to be sure that I would have internet service up until the time I left, and that I did not need cable TV as I was very busy with clearing out the house and moving. I let Comcast know what date I expected to leave, and we agreed to continue the internet service for two days after my departure, to ensure that I would not be without.The Saturday before I left, I took the two converter boxes to Comcast's Lyndon St. office in Detroit and made sure that I got my receipt for them, because I had heard the horror stories of what happens if you don't. I was hoping to avoid that nightmare, but it made little difference. I just got a call this morning that they were going to hand me over to collections for the equipment that was not turned in. Luckily, I have my little pink receipt to prove that I turned them in.When I called last week to find out why I couldn't get into my email account, the customer service rep told me that he saw that I still had their equipment, and I told him that I had a receipt and would scan and forward a copy by email, if necessary. He suggested that I contact Comcast Customer Loyalty to find out about getting access to my email account.This past Saturday, 10/16/2010, my wife made the call to Comcast Customer Loyalty as we only have cell lines, and Saturdays do not count against our minutes. I still wanted to find out if I could either have access to my email account that they closed without informing me in advance, or if they could at least forward all of my email to another address. My wife wanted assurance that Comcast had noted that they did indeed have their equipment back.The first rep told her that since the account was already closed, there was nothing that could be done about accessing my email account or forwarding it to another email address. She was then transferred to Edna to find out about if the equipment issue was resolved. Edna told my wife that she saw in their system where I had turned the equipment in, and that she figured that the customer service rep that I had talked to the week before did not go deep enough into our account information to see that we had our own modem, and that was probably the outstanding equipment that he was referring to. She was very quick, though to see to it that Comcast got their money for the two days that my service was left open after my departure. She assured my wife that she would waive the fee for taking a check over the phone, as we could not pay it online because we no longer had an open account! And with the outstanding fees being taken care of, we would not have to be bothered by Comcast again. Oh, and we never got a bill at our new address either, so I am kind of wondering just how did they intend getting the rest of their money. I did make sure though, that they had my forwarding address. Comcast may have sent the final bill to my old address, and it has just not gotten to me yet.In conclusion, I am hoping that with my return phone call to Comcast regarding the collections issue, they will forward me something indicating that I am now free and clear of them forever. They did give me a case number for future reference, this time with a projected closed by date of November 4, 2010. I will never, ever be tempted to use Comcast in the future. It's like a bad marriage from which you can have the devil of a time getting out of."
"Thomas of Dorchester , ma","Oct. 13, 2010",0,"I called Comcast on 10/01/2010 and ordered the new Internet 2go said the order was in and would see this item by 10/6/2010. Well, since then till 10/11/2010, I have called and asked for a tracking number and they keep saying they do not have one but it shipped. Today, I called them and they admitted it has not shipped and this was a new item for them in this area an they were trying to figure out where it was, but it look like it did not ship and they did not know how to ship it but would call me about 6 pm on 10/12/2010.Well, as you guessed it, they did not call so I called them back, again that nice apology, let me put you on hold an I will talk to a supervisor. On hold for 5 minutes and she came back and said there still working on it and earlier in the day I asked it to be shipped red and ship me another one. Guess what? They still wanna look for the other one.Earlier in the day was also told they did not know how to or where they are at to ship. I also said hum you must new on the job and seems no one knows what to do with any training and she said I been here only three days. Being in the customer service industry, big bells and whistles went of no training, high turn over, everything is scripted. Such a shame , I am now handicapped and I was gonna use this technology to make my life easier away from home. Maybe Comcast should start listening to there customers. Is Verizon FIOS any better?

"Vanessa of Woodbridge, VA","Oct. 11, 2010",0,"I had to move my desktop computer from an upstairs room to a lower level room. (I live in 3 level townhouse). My internet connection was extremely slow so I called Comcast customer service. My first call was 10/03/10, (speaking to Sherry, Ranjani, Shawn, Barry, Chad and Adriane).After being transferred and given various phone numbers and speaking to the above people totaling 3 hours, Adriane claimed the problem was solved. Later on, the internet disconnected. I called customer service again. I spoke with Terea, I explained to her my problem and I was told that I would have to move my router closer to the desktop. So she scheduled an appointment for Saturday 10/09/10 bet. 2pm-5pm. Comcast's automated system called to confirm the appointment on Friday night 10/08/10. The automation again called Saturday morning 10/09/10 to confirm. After no one showing up, at 5:15pm on 10/09/10, I called Comcast to get the status on the technician and was told by Brenda that the appointment was canceled. I asked why and was told that Terea put the order in as a troubleshooting problem, so Comcast canceled the appointment. I was furious. I asked for a supervisor, where Taurean ** came on the phone. He begin to tell me that someone tried to inform me during the week of the cancellation but my mailbox was full.I said that was not true. My messages were checked everyday and besides, I had 2 confirmation calls as recent as the day of the appointment. After going back and forth, Mr. Taurean tried to give me an appointment during the week. I told him I work for a living that's why I had a Saturday appointment. He said the next Saturday appointment was in November. I was not happy and told him that was unacceptable. He then said he would call the Expedite dept to see if I could get an evening appointment and he would call me back the next day.Meanwhile, my internet went down completely Saturday night and I had to call the internet dept to get it working again after about 30 minutes. On Sunday, 10/10/10, Nicole from the Expedite dept called to reschedule my appointment for Tuesday 10/12/10 bet 5pm-8pm. When I asked her name she hung up on me, (fortunately she started speaking on my answering machine when I picked up the phone, that's how I got her name). Since the,n my internet has gone down again (total, 3 times) and I had to call the internet dept once again for service. The gentlemen from internet tech support times were very nice and helpful. But I must say Comcast's overall customer service has been horrible and disenchanting. All this to get my router moved from one location to another. I told the supervisor that I would file a complaint and; that's what I'm doing. I wanted to make this agency aware of Comcast's poor customer service. "
"Armando of League city, tx","Oct. 9, 2010",0,"My internet and phone landline were down. I called Comcast and was told that there was trouble in my area and technicians were working on the problem. The next day, still no internet and phones. I called Comcast again and was told that they would send a technician to my house the next day between 5PM and 8PM to resolve the problem. I received an automated call from Comcast confirming the time of the service call. I waited until 8PM and no serviceman arrived. I called Comcast and was told that I would be on hold for 7 minutes, I waited for 13 minutes and finally spoke to a Comcast rep. I explained that the repairman from Comcast had not arrived. She said it was an hour later at her location (Eastern standard time). She said she would check and she put me on hold. She never returned to the phone. I waited another 20 minutes and finally, another service rep, Lisa, picked up the phone. I had to start from the beginning and explained my situation again. She put me on hold and she never returned to the phone. I waited another 10 minutes and a man from Houston customer service picked up the phone. I had to explain my situation a third time. He told me that my service call to my house had been canceled because the problem was areawide. He stated that someone should have called me and advised me of the canceled appointment. Since my home phone was not working, I was using my cell phone and used up about 60 minutes of time. I am going to look for another company that can offer me the service I need and also has good customer service. I think Comcast has grown so fast that it cannot service all their customers."
"Katie of Plantation, FL","Sept. 24, 2010",0,"Comcast is the absolute worst company. I have their service now and it has been nonstop problems. I would recommend people to avoid this company entirely. I will never use them again and am switching as soon as I can get AT&T to get out here. First of all, their customer service is the absolute worst. After having numerous problems with my connection over a few months time, I finally decided I wanted to complain to upper management. Good luck. I used the online chat service and was told the first name of the Supervisor. I specifically asked for a name, phone number and email. Well, I was told he could not give me that information but I could email comcast.com with my problem. He refused to give me the information I requested., ""Oh no it takes 24-72 hours.""I asked him why the sales guy would tell me 2-3 hours and he said he had no idea. Basically, I was lied to. I was upset and the gentleman said, he would escalate my problem to a supervisor and they would get it done with 24 hours and give me an email. Surprise, surprise, no new speeds, no email. I contacted them a third time and was told, ""Oh no, no upgrade was processed."" So, they never even upgraded my service, even though I talked to them twice.This third time, he swore he was adding the upgrade and it would be done within an hour? An hour? How is that possible? This company is ridiculous. They lie, they are incompetent, they are rude, and they don't even give paying customers information requested. Never order Comcast. And now that AT&T has U-verse there is no reason to stay with a company that treats it's customers like this. "

"Jl of Cypress, TX","Sept. 19, 2010",0,"Also some of my video on my site at some point was not working. Guess what? Comcast had decided to turn on a firewall in my modem which blocked all my video. Great! Got that fixed with help desk.Tech guy did great job. Figured out that modem was old, wire in our yard was old and insufficient. So, he put temporary solution. Everything back up. Great! As happy as a little kid. Then came techs to put real wire. Everything low again after that. So other tech came back out and fixed things again. So happy for a while.Today decided to check again my speed, guess what? Yes, Comcast was super slow again. Called help desk. Tomorrow another tech comes out. Frankly, I hate Comcast, I don't trust them. I will give them another chance. Oh, forgot to mention, they charged my $27 for a ""Customer Complaint Call"". How about that? Deliver a lousy service and charge for that. Comcast should be very rich. Anyone out there. If you have other options, consider them first!"
"Diane of Mount Vernon, WA","Sept. 18, 2010",0,"About 3 weeks ago, I was told Comcast was no longer going to support McAfee and I had to change to Norton. I changed to Norton and since then I receive 30 to 100 spams going out every day to my contacts. When I called Comcast, they said they don't support Norton; I need to call Norton or MSN, or anyone else they think of. I have wasted 1 hour and 15 minutes today alone trying to get someone to agree to come out here and fix it. They said it is my fault and I have to fix it. Well, if they can't, how do they think I can? I have paid for technical help for 10 years and never had this kind of trouble. Yesterday, after 45 minutes on the line with Norton/Symantec, they could not fix it, I should call someone else.Every place I called put me on a phone tree, wasted my time, and all they could do was apologize and say they couldn't fix it. I have done everything suggested, for the first few weeks. I handled them calmly, but now I am enraged and threatening them. What else can I do when a company offers and accepts payment for a service that doesn't work? There is no other option for cable and I pay $120 of my disability income."
"Sotiris of Triangle, VA","Sept. 13, 2010",0,"According to the Comcast website, the following internet service options exist: Performance up to 15Mbps, Blast up to 20Mbps, and Extreme 50 up to 50Mbps.  Yet, when you call on the phone, you are told that Performance is 6-12Mbps and Blast is up to 16Mbps.  Which one is correct?  And shouldn't the advertised rates apply?  Actual rates are typically less than advertised.  But given that Comcast keeps putting out promotions, itŠ—Ès become insulting to be overpaying to services that will never be provided, and they know about it.  "
"James of Ann Arbor, MI","Aug. 29, 2010",0,"Early June 2010, I canceled my Comcast internet services. Almost three passed, Comcast still hold me $50 for equipment fee.

It resulted in me losing 2 hard drives.

"Amy of Orange Park, FL","Aug. 24, 2010",0,"My internet went down about two months ago. Comcast had 6 different technicians come out to fix the problem. I lost 1 month of internet access and probably 24 hours of my life on hold with Comcast. Almost, every time a tech would come out, they would replace my modem and leave. A couple hours later, the internet would go out again. I'd call Comcast back, be hold for hours, and wait 10 days for another tech to show up whenever he felt like it. Finally, Comcast decided that the problem was not my modem (after they changed it 3 times). The problem was at the pole at the front of the neighborhood. Comcast has aggravated everyone in the neighborhood, because we all had the same problem. And because of Comcast's incompetence, it took them 1 month to figure it out. I canceled Comcast, returned my equipment, and again, requested my modem back at the Orange Park branch. The lady was very rude to me and told me I must have a receipt for the modem I purchased years ago. You can see that there is a modem on my account that is not Comcast's. Apparently, that was not proof enough that I owned a modem. To top it off, I received a notice today that Comcast was sending a collector after me for one of their modems. No doubt, one of the three that the tech's switched out. Wow, Comcast has so much nerve. They are fraudulently charging me for not returning their modem, while they have also stolen my mine. "
"Alan of Washington, PA","Aug. 19, 2010",0,"My Comcast highspeed internet (highspeed is a term they use loosely) takes forever to run on our PC and constantly drops offline (no connectivity, can't find server, can't find home router which is less than five feet away, drops activity if phone rings or cable station is changed on TV, and etc.) a hundred times a day. A call for tech support can take hours and then I am told the problem is with the computer, or the router or the laptop, never their problem. I have all of these items checked by Best Buy and everything works perfectly for them (yes, I took everything in and watched how fast and reliable it all worked). I am now considering suing Comcast for contract breech of service and mental pain and suffering. "
"Steve of Half Moon Bay, CA","Aug. 19, 2010",0,"A recent internet failure prompted me to call for repair/svc, and during the call, I was told that they determined that my modem was not working. During discussion of the modem issue, they told me that the modem was their equipment that I was leasing it. Funny thing is, I bought the modem myself, (still have the box and price tag) and they then went on to ""prove"" that it was theirs because they knew the serial # and mac address. Somehow, they forgot that I supplied those #s as part of getting their system to recognize it to allow it to function (they tried this ""ID"" scam twice!). They went on to inform me that I had been paying $5 a month for nearly a year as the lease fee (online billing isn't as good/detailed as I would like, so we never noticed). I haven't decided whether or not to consult an attorney or perhaps the District Atty or even the State AG, yet. And, as a little kicker of abuse, it turned out that my modem was fine. Someone unknown, but using a Comcast-typical device, had actually dead-headed the cable at the point it connects to my house, as they would do when a bill is unpaid (which mine was not, ever). The service tech who found the ""problem"" showed up about 2 hours late as well, and the time spent on the phone so far is about two hours (still unresolved). Comcast's standard solution for all this **? So far, they are offering $20 for the blown service appointment (""That's all we're allowed to do.""). A half day wasted and they offer $20. You get no consideration for the make-up visit if they miss the first one. You just eat another morning or afternoon waiting. "
"Becky of Moundsville, WV",40389,0,"Simply put, there is no such thing as ""high speed"" with regards to Comcast internet service. It does not exist. You can follow any directions, be it from email or on your bill provided by Comcast and it will not increase the speed of your computer. They are nothing but a monopoly whose business and service we are, unfortunately, stuck with. God bless the business that finally comes forth and challenges them. They could offer the same services but charge reasonable prices and would earn a fortune!"
"Danilo of Chickasaw, AL",40379,0,"We are new to Alabama. We were moved here by United Van Lines/King Relocator/Car Transport. Danilo requested service at this private property in Legg Park. During May, he requested wireless service and through many calls, was unable to connect the service. We have two computers, one Mac Apple and one Windows PC. We wanted service so we could use both computers. In June, after another failed attempt, Danilo asked what the additional cost would be for a second modem which we are guaranteed in the privacy of our home 8MG. On June 11th, an installation tech came to our home and installed a second modem. We discovered that we can only have 1MG with the second modem. We called Comcast whom we allowed to enter our private home to provide this service. We were told that this service will be $5 more a month. We called to talk to Comcast and were told we can not have more MG because we wanted 2 modem. We were told we could only have better connection if we had the wireless. When explained the failed connection, there was no resolution. We received a bill for double the amount or 60 a month for internet. We felt that this is fraud because we were told 8MG and only have 1MG. We were falsely led to believe that this would only be an additional $5 but were charged like two household instead of one.This seems to be non-disclosure. I spoke clearly, I said I do not like this, like they entered our home with the intent to defraud us of money, make us pay for their fraud, false advertisement, lack of disclosure in the privacy of our home. They never said they did not understand English, they never said they did not know what I said, but intended to use our sincere intents for fraud and money gains. When told there was a problem, they said there is no solution and no correction, but we must pay for lack of disclosure. They don't know what they are doing or where they are. They cannot hear and refused to listen to what is being said. I returned the modem after being told that they will not correct this and will charge us double for what we will not get. They walked in to the privacy of our home to commit fraud. They are using our home to make money and refuse to respect, communicate. They are actually insulting. They were offensive. After listening to verbal communication, they did not understand they would never be authorized to enter our home if they told the truth or were honest."

"Ben of Avon, CT",40374,0,"This is just the latest in a series of Comcast customer service nightmares. I am named on the account as is my wife. Since I pay the bill, I wanted to pay it online. Of course, there is no easy way to do this so I called Comcast. I talked to 4 different people and got 4 different answers. One said that both my wife and I would have to go to a service center and show ID photos to get my name as the one that pays the account. Finally, I asked to talk to a supervisor. I was told that the supervisor was not available. I said that I would wait. After insisting that I wasnŠ—Èt going anywhere, a supervisor got on and said that they would email me a form to fill out which I would then have to bring to a service center and there is a $10 fee.My wife was with me when I called. She could have gotten on and verified her SSN. All I wanted to do is pay them online. It is a benefit to them yet I have to pay them $10 to change that pays them? People thought Enron took people for a ride. With my last problem with Comcast, it was not resolved until I emailed the president of Comcast. They are a nightmare to deal with. If I had a viable alternative I would drop them in a minute."
"Christine of Riverdale, IL",40373,0,"Last month, we signed up with Comcast for our internet & upgrade of our cable service. Nothing has worked properly since that time. My husband has been on the phone with technicians and representatives countless times. We don't get half of the channels we are suppose to be getting or if we do get them, they are scrambled. Since when does channels 2/5/7 & 9 not come in. Our internet service is pathetic. Lets put it this way, if we want to use our internet service, we have to wait until after 5:00 p.m. It never works before that. It always is saying Comcast is having a server problem or Comcast's server is slow today. The whole problem is Comcast's infrastructure. We live in a low-income area where most of the people can't even afford cable. Comcast ignores replacing old lines with new ones in those areas. They don't care! My husband is getting ready to call Comcast one more time this afternoon. If Comcast does not get on the stick and fix this problem, they lost a customer. I will cancel my phone, cable and internet and go elsewhere. I am not going to pay close to $200.00 per month for something that works not even half the time. Would you? In this economy, no one has money to throw away."
"Darren of Miami, FL",40372,0,"Back in February 2010, I switched our telephone, high-speed internet, and cable TV services over to the Comcast Xfinity plan.  My previous provider on the phone lines was AT&T.  Everything seemed okay at first.  But in July, I accidentally set off my alarm system.  We did not receive the customary call from our alarm system service, so I called them.  They stated that it was probable that Comcast had not installed the line for the alarm properly and I should call them.  I called Comcast and arranged for a technician to come on a Saturday.  The young man arrived, looked around, messed with some wires, and then asked me to test.  It still did not work.  A woman from the alarm system company told us that it was still a problem with Comcast.  The young man said she didn't know what she was talking about etc. and that I should have a technician from the alarm company come out.  I did this, and the young man promptly took off. After a long rainstorm, I went into the backyard and found the phone line access box open with a mass of wires drooping down the side of the house, which I placed in the box as best as I could and closed the panel.  I then went to log onto the internet to attend my online college courses, only to find that I had no internet!  Then, when I picked up the phone, I found I had no phone access!  I called Comcast on my cell, only to be given attitude.  After some discussion, I was told it would be escalated to a supervisor who would call me within the hour.  24 hours later, since I had received no phone call, I called Comcast again and went through the whole explanation, only to be offered another visit from the technician in two days time.  The only times offered were working hours.  So, my wife is taking time off of work to meet the technician again.  This caused loss of class time, which will result in at least one letter grade in one class.  And this caused loss of leave time used to meet with technicians.  Also, this caused months of loss of security for a disabled alarm system."

"Barb of Coatesville, PA",40357,0,"Well, let's just say Comcast keeps reeling me back in and I never learn my lesson! In April 2010, I was solicited by a sales rep for Comcast regarding their service. We decided on a 7-room installment, internet and phone. He stated that my bill would be anywhere from $170.00-180.00/month. Since I was moving, he guaranteed me next-day installation at my new home.I was shocked to see the technician arrive at my home. He was there for 6 hours. He completed 4 of the rooms and only hooked up 2 phone jacks and the internet. He stated that he could not complete the installation, because he would have to drill holes on the outside of my house to get the cable installed in the remaining rooms. He then stated that he would return to finish the room. Well, if anyone has ever moved before, you know that cable is the last thing on your mind. We never received our first bill (so darn typical of Comcast). Then we were surprised to see a bill in May for over $400.00. So my husband decided to contact Comcast, and as usual, if you owe a balance, you can't get through. Finally in June, we were able to get through, thanks to a friend who works for Comcast. My husband spoke with a young man by the name of Stefan who guaranteed that we would receive some type of compensation for the inconvenience of only having 4 rooms installed and for the phone. Well, my husband was so happy for him being so understanding. He stated, ""Don't worry about the phone issue; we can live with only having phone usage in 2 rooms."" What a wrong thing to do! Stefan also guaranteed that a tech would be by that Saturday to finish the installation (which happened 2 months later!) and that we will receive a new bill with the credits. Although my husband had not wanted to pay a thing until it was corrected, he paid 1/2 of the bill. His philosophy: 1/2 the payment for 1/2 the work! So as promised, a technician was out to complete the job (and he didn't have to drill outside!). This was on 6/12/10. Well, needless to say, it is now 6/28; and we have no phone or cable. And God only knows when the internet will go down. So we contacted Comcast and spoke with Josie who stated that there was no record of the credits (Go figure!) and that she would need to email Stefan to find out what type of credit he was going to issue! (So we were to wait all over again!) So I decided not to wait. I immediately called back and spoke with Roz and asked for a supervisor or manager; she refused to patch me through. She said that she needed to get info from me. Needless to say, I never spoke with a supervisor. I explained my situation to her, and she stated, ""Well, on 4/19, we credited your account $79.50 for the installation."" There wasn't supposed to be a charge for the installation! And she said that the most she could do was credit the remaining $51.95 for the installation. Again, there wasn't supposed to be an installation fee! And that is not good enough! We have gone 2 1/2 months without the proper installation. She then stated that she couldn't do anything else because we were only charged for the package and the 2 HD boxes. But hold on, our package was for a 7-room installation! What in the world! So needless to say, after speaking with Roz, she transferred me to Jennifer in collections who started by saying that we were not getting another credit for anything else, even after I explained our situation. She said that we needed to make up our mind as to what we were going to do because our account was in the red and that we haven't made a payment since we started the services. What?! I was furious by this time and stated that my husband paid over $200.00 with Stephan via a debit card. She looked and saw the payment and said, ""Still you need to pay the $208.00 before your services will be turned back on and you need to decide what you are going to do!"" What kinda customer services does Comcast think they are providing?! Since they basically cornered the market in my area, we are pretty much stuck with them! Comcast needs to remember that it is customers like me who provide them the money to pay their bills, not the CEO. Without the customer, you would not have a job!"
"Maurice of Port Charlotte, FL",40343,0,"A salesman offered me a great triple play deal. Installation was marred by requiring 3 visits with 3 no shows.

"Zosima-Susie of Union City, CA",40341,0,"Comcast deceived me with their promo product packages. This company do not honor what they offer. This is deception. Comcast just increased my bill with not warning or notices at all. When I called them up to complain about the promotion offered to me, Comcast told me that I cannot get into any promotion anymore, that I have to pay $164.99 as per my bill. I downgraded my service on June 5, 2010 because I refused to pay Comcast anymore money. Now when the downgrade happened in June 5, 2010, I've been having problem with my cable service and my internet service. At night like 11:00PM, when I would turn on my TV to watch the news, I would find no service.When I take my online classes, my internet service would get turned off. Do you see what happens if Comcast cannot suck anymore money from you? The staff would play with my cable/internet services. All what I can do is to devote my time to call a technician and they would relate to you their bible studies of reasons why I do not have cable/internet services. Comcast deceives you and makes fun of your services if they cannot suck any more money from you. Is there a law to prohibit from this kind of business practice? Please help. Thanks."
"Lynn of Elkhart, IN",40326,0,"When I see online complaints about companies, I am sometimes suspicious the complaints have been posted by competitors. So for the record, I'd like to state that I am in no way connected with the ISP world. I'm just a frustrated internet user who is paying Comcast for the purported reliability of 24/7 ISP/phone service, but am plagued with extended service interruptions. We are located between **.During the last 2 weeks, our Comcast internet and telephone service has 6 times gone out for 1-3 hours, usually in the early morning, 4-7 am period. Our cable TV service is not interrupted. When this happens, we call Comcast and they verify that the modem is off line. They sent out a service technician who replaced our modem but that did not resolve the problem. Reportedly, Comcast has scheduled a line service check (to take place sometime in the next 10-14 days!). They have issued a whopping $6 refund, to compensate us for approximately 20 hours accumulated service outages. To appreciate our frustration you should be aware that this is not an isolated instance. A similar spate of service interruptions took place about 6 months ago and about 6 months before that and about 6 months before that.When this happened a year ago, Comcast reran the line from the pole to our house. When it happened 6 months ago, the line-check rep found a cable box at the pole on our neighbor's property, that had been improperly reassembled and was filled with water. When it happened 18 months ago, the line-check rep said lines in our area are old, run through water pockets and need to be rerun. That ""jives"" with our observation that most service interruptions take place when it's raining or morning dew is heavy. We rarely have an outage on a bright sunny day.Ours is not a large residential area. The number of people effected might be few, but maybe not. If you're experiencing Comcast ISP outages in the **, weigh in here, maybe if enough of us complain, Comcast will fix it."

They had to replace the modem as I was not getting any internet nor mail. Now they've threatened to charge me 2 visits. As a new customer, they quoted me $101.77 which after it was installed, I paid $171.26 & I was to get credit for the over charges.

"Gregory of Nashville, TN",40319,0,"In mid March, I obtained service from Comcast for internet services only. The installer gave me the wrong information, about what kind of modem I needed to use DOCSIS3 speeds, and the modem models on their website, and with customer service also gave the wrong information. A ""clerical"" error kept me at the lower rate, so I wasn't losing too much in bandwidth. When my April/May bill came out, the floods came to Nashville. I called the auto information line, and it said there was an outage in our area. The only thing is all the other families in my building with Comcast had no outage for the 6 days I experienced one.Two techs were sent out, who fixed my DOCSIS3 modem issue, and made sure I was on the proper billing tier, took about 2 hours to fiddle with their box on the well to get my connection up to snuff, as best as they could. Because some flood issues further upstream, were causing minor radio noise on the lines. Okay, I can accept that it will be fixed, as things get back to normal. But these techs blew out 4 other families' cable connections in the building, while ""fixing"" mine. Now, it took me 6 days to get assistance.Somehow, these 4 families got a tech out the next day, to fix their cable/internet and degraded my line to the point that, by 1.5 days later, their internet analyst, Ana, did something on her end, and I lost all connection. Until then, just my download speeds were being affected, and not my upload. I did a back trace route, and reported the server that was between my house and modem, was not responding. There was nothing, just hours and hours of aggravation. I was told that it would be 3 days before a tech could come out. I understand, that in normal circumstances, their SLAS are 24 hours or less. They refused to respond.The tech did not show up on Tuesday or Wednesday, but I found a call tag on my door, after I just got home from dropping off their modem to a ""counter location"". The address in the phone books is some locked down secretary spot. She stated people always come here. I said it's the address in the phone book for all local Comcast listings. She gave me a ""map"", of how to get to a counter location. I paid these jokers $250 for a tech who didn't do the install correctly at $40. I was out for 10 days with no service. They ""refunded"" my first set of outage days. I'm awaiting my bill for the second. The headaches from using their ""internet"" service, and talking with an analyst, only to be ""hung up on"", after being told ""you need to call this"" and  ""I can't help you"". I got their ""advertised"" speeds on their network, try speedtest.comcast.net, but not on the internet, because of latency/resistance. Try just speedtest.net. This is how the ""claim"" of speeds is determined. So the first speed test is only on their network. The second is the true internet. They totally have a sweet monopoly in this town. No other cable companies are allowed. However, out of this metropolitan area, they have competition. I've lost time, and gotten half baked results. I was charged for things that I did not get service on. It was a total waste."

I have been calling since March 2010 and have records of each call. They confirmed that the problem is outside and have repeatedly told me that they would have maintenance come out and boost the signal. To date, this still has not been resolved. I need help. I am constantly being disconnected. I am so frustrated with their poor service and promises of resolving this issue and not doing so. I am unemployed and have been for some time.

Now I am being held responsible for his bill and cannot get service or my rebate for equipment purchased for $100.00 unless I pay his bill up to date. Is this even legal?

The cell phone battery went dead (The Call started with a full batteries), then had to change over another phone.The tech. we talked to finally agreed, that it was not just the wireless and that even with a direct connection to the computer we were loosing connection. But the best he could do even after being on the phone and on hold, he could not schedule an appointment and would have to have someone call us. We still are losing connection and no one is calling and we can't get anyone to come out. Why do we stay with them? Because that is our only option.

I had to call them to unblock it the day it was set up, amazing. They lied about the free netbook for signing up. I signed up and they say I never signed a contract I never received so I said I will cancel your service then. The verbal contract says I will pay a fee or get submitted to the credit agencies.

"William of St Helena Is, SC",40260,0,Trying to use the Comcast high speed internet self install program has been one of the frustrating things I have done in many years. I have gotten into the system but cannot use the email either to send or receive any message except ones I do not want. Their is no anti spam program in this boondogle that I am able to find. I was told by the local agent that I would be able to bring my email address book from outlook express to this account and I now find that is impossible to do. A customer service rep from Orlando attempted to help me but she gave up also and said it was a problem with Outlook express. I seriously doubt that since outlook express worked very well until I made the mistake of transferring to Comcast high speed internet service. This problem must have an answer and I would appreciate knowing what it is. 
"Unni of Ashland, VA",40249,0,"I am a small business owner started an office in Ashland VA in Feb 2010. I opted to go with Comcast Internet and phone line. Comcast has published my line to the world and it interrupts my work terribly. Poor phone quality and annoying incoming is giving more headache than I wanted. So I called up Comcast to request to discontinue phone line with Comcast. Ms. Susan from Comcast said, I had signed a three year contract with Comcast and I just completed one month trial period and a cancellation would result in fee over thousand dollars. Apparently, the exit clause is paying off 70 percent of the future fees to Comcast.Is this one sided contract valid? It is causing significant productivity loss with unwanted phone calls. "

"Sharon of Detroit, MI",40245,0,"I called to see why I could not get on 90% of the websites I wanted to get on. They insisted that it was not Comcast's fault. So for about month, I could only get about 3 or 4 websites. Every time I got on the internet, Comcast site would pop up and would not allow me to get on the website I wanted to get on. I asked my son if he could fix it. He called Comcast and they told him it was a problem on their end. So after being charged for an internet service I could not use for over a month, I feel my account should get a credit."
"Nancy of Somerset, NJ","Feb. 28, 2010",0,"I received a very threatening call from Comcast a few weeks ago in which the man calling told me that (in my 20 years with this company) I went over my (unknown) bandwidth limit in January. He was very stern, intending to be threatening and told me if I ""ever do it again"", they will turn off my internet for 1 year! I asked if they would tell me when I was approaching this ""limit"" and he said they would not!! I asked if I could pay for more bandwidth and he responded that I could not! This after just once going over a limit I didn't even know I had and have no way of measuring. We had been watching movies on Netflix streaming and I totally believe that of course, they know that and they are threatening customers who are using the competition to watch movies. This really is monopolistic! Please help as I must have email for work."
"Rivkah of Sacramento, CA","Feb. 23, 2010",0,"We moved to Sacramento in August 2009 and have had a series of problems with Comcast. First, they promised a ""free netbook"" computer with the package we purchased. After months of phone calls verifying that we would receive the netbook, I called again only to be told that we were no longer eligible because they had not received the appropriate form from us in time. I explained that I had faxed the agreement in early September and in fact had called them in October, November and December asking about the status. While this is a small matter, as a consumer it does not bode well if Comcast is purchasing interest in a television network. I am used to dealing with companies that operate with integrity. Comcast does not care about the consumer!Our most recent adventure is with a problem in service. They sent someone out and verified before the visit that there would be no charge. Upon receiving the bill, we were charged $27.99 for the visit and had to spend 30 minutes dealing with several people to get the charges reversed. I just want our netbook. Ideally, we would be allowed to drop the service and try something else but we have a contract."
"Michael of Folsom, CA","Feb. 12, 2010",0,"I signed up for high speed internet. It is supposed to be 12mbps down and 4mbps up. I'm not seeing those numbers on a consistent basis. In fact, when I am downloading a file from the internet or email, everyone else in my house can download at no more than about 200kbs. It appears as though Comcast is throttling bandwidth when files are being downloaded. In addition, downloading speeds hover around 500kb/s most of the time, not even close to the advertised 12mbps. I feel that Comcast has misrepresented their product and I will probably demand my money back. This is very very disappointing. I am losing time and money, product not as advertised."
"Steven of Ware , MA","Feb. 11, 2010",0,"We pay almost $150 per month for service which includes internet!  We constantly have email issues due to Comcast IP issues.  They try to filter spam so our outbound email always gets bounced back.  I have spent at least 20 hours on the phone and internet trying to fix it and it keeps coming back.  They are our only choice, so they feel they can stick it to us as we have no choice.  The worst thing is they never notify you of issues and just do what they want.  Then when you call for help, they say someone will call you back and they usually donŠ—Èt."
"Kevin of Valparaiso, IN","Feb. 9, 2010",0,"I am experiencing a similar problem as Richard from Fair Oaks. Intermittent Internet and digital phone service, digital TV service unaffected. The first level of support is as with most organizations, not very skilled. If you can't correct it with the set of instruction, they are provided to give to you; they simply want to schedule a very inconvenient home visit. I am a systems administrator, thus fairly technically competent and though I do not have access to prove it, the issue points to a server problem. I am on call 24/7. Most emergency issues I can handle remotely, if I have a reliable Internet connection. My Comcast connection is far from reliable. If an after hours emergency occurs, I need to drive onto campus and correct it."
"Richard of Fair Oaks, CA","Feb. 2, 2010",0,"I called Comcast on 1/6/10, 1/8/10, 1/9/10, and a few more times after that. I reported that the internet was not working. Having had this problem before, I reset my modem per the Comcast instructions many times; but still no internet. It's funny how during this outage, my television service still worked correctly, but I only received intermittent service on my internet. Once again, I called to report that the problem was still occurring intermittently. I explained to them that one of their techs had been here and that he checked the modem and the wiring and there was nothing wrong with them (at least that is what he told me). They insisted they would have to send someone out again. I responded that I felt it was unnecessary, but if you do, I don't want to be charged.They sent out another technician who agreed with me that it appears to be a problem at either their server or one of their nodes. Additionally, he informed me that some of my other neighbors approached him and reported to him that they were experiencing outages also. Within 24 to 48 hours after his visit, the internet service was working without any intermittent outages and has since worked extremely well.In my opinion, what Comcast has done is borderline illegal. If I were a lawyer and had the wherewithal to investigate this issue, I'm sure I'd find that in this instance, there was a problem either at the server or node as the technician had stated. However, Comcast will not even investigate my complaint. They won't let me talk to anyone higher than a supervisor. I asked the supervisor and the call center rep to provide me with the history of my calls and the notes taken. Although they did note that there was an outage, they refused to waive the fee they had charged me, supposedly because the technician stated in his notes that the resolution could have been handled over the phone. Therefore, according to the call center reps, the customer will pay for the service call (that I didn't want)."
"Carol of Denver, CO","Jan. 28, 2010",0,"Comcast internet installer lied to me, conned me into high-speed internet connection. It was good for a certain period of time under an introductory offer. He told me when the introductory offer ended, I would need to call Comcast and have another technician come out to disconnect the high-speed internet connection and that I would have to pay for the service call. I called Comcast customer service, they said that was not true. I believe Comcast in Denver is extorting customers. I am on unemployment and I need my computer to look for jobs online. This type of coercion is nothing more than an act of a bunch of thugs who have hijacked the Denver internet community."
"Peter of San Jose, CA","Jan. 20, 2010",0,"I had Comcast cable installed in September of 2008 for TV and internet. The cable installer needed to install an M-card into my TiVo for it to work with their system. The first card the installer tried did not work, however, the tech wrote that number on my work order before testing that. He then took that card out and put a second card in its place and lightly crossed out the first number on the work order. Jump forward 6 months. I start getting a $50 unreturned equipment charge on my bill for the first card (the one I never received). I called and they said, ""okay, we'll do an inventory check and get back to you. Meanwhile, don't pay that portion of your bill"". They never got back to me. I had to go through it all again the next month and the next. Getting angry, I asked that they do something about this. So they agreed to send a tech out to my house to physically check my equipment. Fine by me. The tech came out, understood my situation, made a call and the charge isn't on my next bill. Yeah! Success. Oh wait, jump forward another 6 months. I got a mysterious phone call from ""Comcast equipment recovery group"" or some such. They want to know about a cable card I still have that they want back (with the original serial number from the one I never got). I explained the whole story from above and the guy said, ""OK, thank you"" and assured me when I asked that it isn't an issue. Next bill, $30 unreturned equipment charge on my bill again (strangely the equipment now costs less). I did my duty and called Comcast to inquire (also about why my bill is nearly twice the previous month). Oh, that's because you must pay full price now and there are no incentives to keep you anymore"". I cancelled the TV portion, but they said my internet cost will go to $70/month without the TV part so I ended up paying for basic $15 which makes my bill less than $70, but not by much. By the way, Basic TV I already got over the antenna with better quality. So I'm paying for service I don't need or use now just to keep my internet. Anyway, on with the story. So they say, ""our records show you have a card that belongs to us"". I say, ""yeah, the one I'm using"". They say ""no, the other one"". I say ""what other one?"". They say ""okay, we'll check our inventory to see if we can find it. If we don't, you will owe us. Meanwhile, ignore the $30 portion of your bill"". Now, they will never find that card. I'm sure it was lost by the installer and will never see the light of day again. Now, I'm back to where I started a year ago (oh yeah, but for $20 less now).This is the way a new customer has been treated. This company may not be a monopoly by the pure definition, but it acts like one. They even told me I should get my internet somewhere else if I don't like their prices. OK then. I have already contracted for DSL at 1/3 the price for about 1/2 the BW (that is the most I can get, so yes Comcast has a monopoly on any speed higher). I'm looking forward to calling and cancelling my account as soon as the DSL goes live. I'm not looking forward to the runaround I'm facing about the phantom cable card I supposedly have. Like I'd want an inactive cable card. Like it would have any value to me at all.Did I mention that I was supposed to get a ""free"" cable box with my original order, but since I opted for the smaller, cheaper cable card only I had to pay $2/month for that? I hate Comcast. I only ordered because I was offered a reasonable rate. I always said when the rates go up, I'm gone. Evil, evil company. Yes, every argument comes to this. Evil like Nazi evil. You know what word is the most sarcastic way ever devised to say ""fantastic""? You guessed it. ""Comcastic"". I said that to a customer service rep in a joking way and was told that they would hang up on me if I kept using abusive language. I had to mute my phone so they wouldn't be offended by my hysterical laughing."
"Mike of Greensburg, IN","Jan. 20, 2010",0,"Upon moving into my new residence, I contacted Comcast to connect my internet services to my new home. Coming from an area which Comcast has competition, which here there is none via wires of any kind, I notice a very slow speed when downloading simple drivers for a printer. I tested the speed via a couple of websites including Comcast's speed test site and found that at times, the download speed was running at dial up specs. I sent them a copy of the speed tests and also reminded them that there is a competitor gearing up to provide service in my area. I also stated that with this happening, they should make sure that their services were running at tip top shape. Within a day, the speeds, download and upload increased dramatically. It stayed that way for a couple of months. They always want to ""suggest"" it is the complaining party's equipment. Even their website targets the consumer's equipment and doesn't even suggest that their lines are not performing. Even when I talked to them, the same thing and wanted to charge for a service call. My brother is an IT guy who provided me with the internet speed test sites to keep an online log. Well, my service tanked again. It will not even come close to support VOIP service. You would think that with Comcast's own speed test site, they would have it set up to ""flag"" when somebody does these tests which shows a degradation of service. But no! I dread having to deal with again. There again lies lack of innovation on their part. Why because more times then not, they don't have to. Lack of competition. One of the biggest problems with Comcast is that in some areas, smaller cities and towns, they don't have competition which a family or a business is stuck with them if they want anything other than wireless internet via cell phone or satellite --which is pricey. In these same areas, even their CATV is pricey as well. They have a captive consumer group. Well as soon as I get notification that this new company is good to go, so am I. "

"Joe of Melrose, MA","Oct. 28, 2009",0,"Recently, my email account, along with all data contained therein, was deleted without any notification. This occurred on a current account with an excellent payment history. It is truly remarkable that any service provider would delete the email account of a paying customer and then refuse to restore the data. Within my account, I had ongoing correspondences with my mortgage provider, with contractors who are being paid thousands of dollars to renovate my home, with other service providers, and I had information about upcoming travel plans. Remarkable.My understanding is, this occurred basically because Comcast employees working the phone lines are not equipped to handle anything unusual, however basic. In my case, I asked for an additional service to be provided at a new address. So, I was paying Comcast twice for service at two addresses. Apparently, despite my insistence that this was not a transfer order, and despite additional instructions from the Comcast employee who performed the installation service at my home that this was not a transfer order, the new account was initiated as a transfer from my previous address. Immediately after initiating my new service, the service at my old address was terminated. When I complained, a new account apparently was started at my old address, but my email address and data were missing.I will spare the other embarrassing details of customer service, such as the deletion of another email account of mine at the new address prior to the creation of an account that was a misspelling of my name. I won't even mention the messages left on my voice mail about ""the new tenant"" who wanted to move into my newly purchased house. I complained enough to get a work order to fix this problem and reactivate my email account with all its data. Nothing ever happens on this work order, but when I call to inquire, I am assured that this is still an ""open job."" I think it will always be an ""open job"" where nothing happens."
"Jeff of West Bloomfield, MI","Oct. 13, 2009",0,Comcast high-speed Internet is not high speed. It takes 1 minute to load 6MB - that is 0.1mps not the 20mps that is advertised. Nobody at Comcast can help. Save your money and get DSL.
"David of Waldorf, MD","Oct. 6, 2009",0,"On Friday, October 2nd, I contacted Comcast on the phone to inquire about upgrading my internet service from my existing speed to the 50 Mb/second service. For those that do not know, this requires a cable modem that is DOCSIS 3.0 compliant. My existing cable modem is not DOCSIS 3.0 compliant, so I knew I needed a new cable modem. I am fully capable of installing equipment and getting line check information. I asked the Comcast representative on the phone what was required, and her initial response was that my service area was not upgraded to 50 Mb/second speeds. I informed her that it was as I knew someone in the area that had the service. She said she had to check and would call back.Five minutes later she called back and confirmed that, indeed, the service was available. She also informed me that it would cost $99/month; it would require renting a modem from Comcast at a monthly fee, and would require a $29.95 installation charge. I told her that I didn't want to pay $29.95 for someone to come in and disconnect my existing modem and hook up a new one as I could do that. She refused to waive the charge, and I told her that would cost Comcast $99/month of lost revenue. Researching on Comcast's website showed that the service fee was either $9.95 or $99.95 to connect to the 50 Mb/second service. I have no idea where the $29.95 fee came from. Later on that same day I made a post on Comcast's forums detailing my phone call experience. George, from Comcast, read the message and responded immediately that he would help.On Saturday, with George's suggestion, I had purchased the required modem and emailed George the MAC address. By Monday morning George had done a line test (remotely), I hooked up the new modem, and George provisioned it (remotely). By 10:30am on Monday I was running at the increased speeds with no installation fee. So, it appears that Comcast does have representatives that go that extra mile to make things right. I can understand the fees for those that are not able to do the installations. However, Comcast should be able to work with their customers to get them the service they want without unnecessary fees when those customers can do without a representative coming to the house."

I later got an email to ""agree"" to the term commitment, that there is a $150 charge for canceling early. Also, I got my first bill with $175 additional charges - installation, line install, new connection! I went to their site and emailed them about this. No response. Then I chatted live with a CSR who kept saying, Š—“Sorry, you must understand that if there is an installation, there really are installation charges.Š— I asked for a manager. She said she couldn't do anything. I asked, Š—“Who could?Š— She replied that she would submit a credit request and look into this. I asked her when I would hear back. Answer was 48 to 72 hours.

"As of Cupertino, CA","Aug. 26, 2009",0,"I had Comcast Internet service last year. It was cancelled a year ago while keeping the cable connection. After that, my spouse tried to get the service through discount offer program but Comcast refused to provide it. Now a year later, I ordered it again through broadbandoffers.com. However, when I called Comcast for the cable installation, they started putting me through one representative after another. Each of them would give different information and push me to pay extra for installation for each service. Some nonsense lady even started saying that they upgrade the system every month and wires have to be changed to get the signal. In other words, I have to buy extra package of wires from one of their locations.One of the representatives told me that she could see in the system that I had Comcast cable service 9 months ago. Another representative said that I had an appointment scheduled on August 15th, quite surprising because I ordered my service only on the 21st of August! Then, at last, another moron lady came with attitude and said that she can't see any order even though I gave her the confirmation number. She asked me to put a new order directly with Comcast , of course, at higher rate. Looks like they have tagged my address - and every time I call them, they start behaving differently after I give them my address and phone number. Looks like they have my details tagged for some reason and are discriminating even though I qualify all the terms and conditions to get a new connection."
"Kathleen of Weymouth, ma","Aug. 25, 2009",0,"Comedy of errors is what happened. On August 23, I called Comcast to ask why an extra $130(!) was on our bill. After waiting 14 minutes(!) for a customer service rep to answer, she agreed that charges should not have been there. In the midst of our call, my phone and internet service went dead. Now, my blood pressureŠ—Ès rising. I called from my cell phone, and got a kid named Aaron, who said his employee # was ** on the phone. I'd asked for a supervisor and he said he was one ""sort of"". I told him I want a billing supervisor and he said there's no billing supervisor but that he can work with my bill. Our ""conversation"" was a one-sided monologue, not allowing a word in, despite two of us raising our voices for him at this point to please stop talking. It appeared on our end he was medicated. That was, until he said, ""I see your separate charge for the Internet and I don't know why that's there.Š— I said, Š—“Neither do we, and that's why we're calling you.Š— Silence.I said, ""Hello?"" and he said, ""I'm confused. What do you want me to do?"" Our jaws were on the floor. I reminded him it was his job to look into the charges, and find out why they were there, and to remove them. He said, Š—“I can't tell if they're supposed to be there or not.Š— It was absurd. When I collected my emotions a bit later, I called and got a genuine supervisor on the phone named Phil. He not only explained the error on Comcast's end, but removed the charges. But, I still had the problem of having no phone/internet. So after I was done with Phil, he transferred me to tech service. That call too got disconnected (from my cell). When I did get through, a guy named Carlos told me I need to have a service tech come out. We just had a service tech here 2 weeks ago to replace faulty equipment we rent from Comcast. I told him I couldn't make the appointment tonight because we weren't going to be around. He made it anyway, I discovered. Worse (or better) yet, the service miraculously came back tonight. Our neighbors, as well as us, are fed up with Comcast and are looking into Verizon FiOS.

"Bob of Palmyra, NJ","Aug. 24, 2009",0,"We moved here in June 2009 and have the Comcast TV/Internet/telephone subscription package. Every day since the installation, we have had loss of connection to the Internet and telephone. This happens at least a dozen times a day. There are moments where I can stay connected to the Internet 1 minute at max, and this happens multiple times in a row. We have had Comcast at least 8 times here to repair the problem, and guess what, it still isn't fixed. A Comcast ""repair"" man was here this week and said he can't fix the problem because the problem is outside and he is only an indoor technician. A couple of days later, a Comcast outdoor technician came here and said the problem is inside and he can't fix it because he is an outdoor technician.Today, a line technician was supposed to repair the problem. Three repairmen in 5 days and still no resolution. This is a complete joke. If there were another cable and Internet provider in the area, we would subscribe with them. But we can't do so because Comcast is a monopoly company. We have to have Comcast call us on our mother-in-law's phone because ours isn't reliable - and I use our home phone to run a business. Comcast is a disgrace. Each technician that is here seems to try to set a record of how fast they can get in and out without solving the problem.

I scheduled an appointment for July 18th from 5 to 8PM to install the service. The technician never came and I called the customer service, which was not helpful at all. They said that the technician called and did not even leave a message or anything. He did not even come to my apartment. I was waiting at the lobby and no one came from 4:30 to 9:00PM (appointment from 5 to 8:00PM). How do I know if they really came? I left work early, I was at home at 4:30PM. I called customer service. It was 6:30PM, still in the window time for them to come but they said they will not come. I canceled the installation after talking to your Comcast customer service and finding no solutions. Then, I tried again and they told me I needed to open a new account. Surprise, now instead of $29.99, I would have to pay $59.99! Way to go after waiting for more than 3 hours (it was already around 8:30PM), I got higher prices for the same service. I decided to try something else, but again, they are the only provider. Then last week, August 14, 2009, I tried again. I found the same price as before, $29.99 special, and the salesperson put on hold for several minutes. She apologized and gave a really good deal for my area. She said that the technician will come today (08/19/09) between 8 and 11AM. It is 9:00AM and we called before 9:00AM. The customer service agent told us that there is no appointment scheduled for today! My wife took the day off for this today. She is really frustrated that she has to lose one day of work and then Comcast's only answer is ""Man, there is nothing we can do. You need to reschedule.""

"Katie of Alexandria, VA",40015,0,"I moved into a basement apartment in a row house and needed to set up internet. I contacted Comcast as there was still equipment in the basement from Comcast from the last resident. They were initially unable to understand that it was a basement apartment in a private home, not an apartment building. After putting me on hold repeatedly, they told me to ask my landlord if I could be part of their account. I did and my landlord prefers separate accounts as the apartment is completely separate. I called Comcast back and it took half an hour to explain to Pontsho (who did genuinely try to help me, but had to continually put me on hold to ask her supervisor) that I live in a basement apartment and need to just reactivate the same service that someone else had been using for the last year. Finally, they told me the only way that they could recognize a separate apartment at the same physical address was if I faxed over a copy of something that had been mailed to me so that they could see that the post office accepted the address. It was Friday and I couldn't fax until Monday, so I had to wait. In the meantime, Pontsho even called me back to check the progress of faxing, as she did want to help me and was making a real effort.Monday, I faxed several bills, etc., that showed my address as accepted by the post office. I called 4 hours later, as they had not contacted me, and had to explain the entire situation over again to Neil. He again told me that they no longer offer separate accounts at the same physical address, to which I replied that that was why Comcast had requested that I fax the information. After being put on hold repeatedly and told the same thing over and over, I told Neil that I wanted to speak with a supervisor. He tried to convince me not to, but I insisted. He put me on hold several more times, then told me that all the supervisors were busy and that if I wanted to talk to one, I could get a ""ticket number"" and they would call me back by the end of the day. It was 8:15 pm. If they had not been able to give me any service, they should have told me immediately. Apparently, no one knows what their true policies are and there is no consistency. Every time I have tried to get Comcast in the past, there have been similar issues. I will not be a Comcast customer again."
"Vahid of Moraga, CA",40012,0,"I relocated about 1 month ago, and since I relocated, I had a nightmare experience with Comcast. I have all my services with them: phone, internet, and cable services. For 4 days, I had no services at all. I had technicians four times at my house and for each visit, I lost a day of work and income. Then they connect the cable, and it takes 3 weeks to make it work for a day. But this time, I lost all my e-mail accounts with saved mail, address book, and all valuable memories. And for 6 days, I couldn't send or receive e-mail. Now they created a new account for me. However, I lost all the data I had saved in Comcast. This is a nightmare."
"Anna of Fairfax, ca",40003,0,"My internet service went out on June 28. It came back on briefly June 29. I called and reported it on June 30. I have a home office and I was unable to work without internet. I was told that Comcast could not come out until July 2. Comcast came out, reviewed the wiring in my house, and said that the problem was up at the street at the pole. The technician told me that he would report the problem and someone would be out that afternoon to fix it. The next morning, July 3, I still had no service. I called and I was told that no one was scheduled to come out and that they couldn't come out until later that week. I paid the man to help me because I have a home office and couldn't work. He found someone to come out between 1pm and 5pm on July 3.I waited and called Comcast on 5/4/30 and was told that they would still be there by five o'clock. At 5:40pm, I called Comcast and I was told they couldn't get there until 6:45pm. I was very upset because July 3 was a holiday and my day off from work and I had spent it waiting for Comcast to show up. I asked them to come Saturday morning at 10am instead. Comcast came on July 4 and fixed the internet up at the street. I called Comcast today to complain about the service I had received. I was told that they would give me a credit of $10.71 for my loss of internet service for the week. I asked to speak to this person's manager.After being put on hold for 20 minutes, Christine ** came on the line. She told me that she could give me $10.71 of credit for internet service. When I said that was not enough for the pain and suffering, loss of income and various inconveniences of spending hours and hours of time on the phone, she said she would give me a credit of $27.99 for one of the service calls. I was shocked. I asked her if she meant that I had to pay for these service calls of Comcast coming out to fix their equipment. She said, yes, I had been charged for two service calls at $27.99 each and she was willing to give me a credit for one of them.When I insisted that was not adequate, she agreed to credit me for both service calls because it was Comcast equipment that was at fault. I lost a week's worth of work and hours of time dealing with Comcast. They made no effort to compensate me for my time, energy, and loss of income. They were unfriendly, uncooperative, and unwilling to offer decent, honest service. I believe they should have serviced their equipment immediately the day I called. And if they couldn't do it, they should have called me and let me know that they can't make it on time."
"Renee of Detroit, MI",40001,0,"I only purchased high-speed internet through Comcast, but decided to bundle with another company. They cancelled the account and mailed a box to me so that I could return the modem. The box did not come with further instructions, just the UPS return label. I placed the modem in the box and took it to the UPS store on April 1, 2009. I received a bill for $66 shortly after, but the rep assured me that the charges would drop off once the modem was returned. A few weeks later, I got another bill. So I called and the rep asked when I had mailed the package and what the tracking number was. I did not have it on me at the time, so he told me to call back and provide it. I did the next business day, but this rep said, ""We don't need the tracking number; we got it already because we gave it to you!"" She assured me that the charge would be adjusted off once the box was scanned. The next month, I received another bill from Comcast and a collections letter from a company they hired regarding the $66. I called Comcast on 6/6/09 and the rep told me to go to my nearest customer center and give them the receipt. I did that, but the rep at the center said he couldn't help me because the modem number is not on the receipt. I tried to make it clear that I returned the modem in the box provided to me, not a brick! He again stated he couldn't help me and suggested I call their customer service number and speak with a supervisor! Here I am in a customer service center being told to call customer service! I called and requested to speak with a supervisor, but the rep outright refused! She stated the first thing that needed to be done was a box research. She completed the forms and told me I'd be contacted within 14 business days. I know that the box is sitting in some warehouse and hasn't been scanned yet! My best friend works for Comcast and he just so happens to scan returned equipment in their warehouses! I informed him of the situation and even provided him with the delivery date, time, and the person who signed for it. He knows the person that signed for the package and stated he would handle it. A week later, he called me and told me everything was taken care of. For some reason though, I wanted to be sure. So I called Comcast 7/7/09 and the rep told me that there was still a balance and I was sill in collections! I demanded a supervisor, but the rep told me to speak with the collections department. I called collections and they wanted to do another box research. I refused to be put off and wait another 2 weeks with no results. I again requested a supervisor, who noticed that a box research was put in on 6/6/09 but nothing had been done about it. He suggested I go to a customer service center and I informed him that I did and was turned away! He took down all of the information that I had to provide and promised to follow up with me. Hopefully, something gets done soon because this is affecting my credit. This is not fair!"
"Veronica of Pikesville , MD",39996,0,"I have been without internet since last Thursday (6/25). After numerous calls to Comcast, they agreed to send a technician out on Wednesday, 7/1. They agreed to call when they were 30 minutes away and did call at 1:45 pm. I got home at 2:00 pm and waited until 2:30 to call Comcast to find out where the tech was. The woman I spoke to told me their tech had already come and that I wasn't home. When I told her that I was told I would be given 30 minutes from the time of the call, she said she got in touch with the tech and he would be on his way back to my home before 3pm. At 3:15, I called Comcast again and was on hold until 4 before I was told the tech would not be coming and the person I spoke to before was incorrect when they told me the tech was coming back. Then I was told I would have to reschedule for Monday, 7/6! When I finally spoke to a supervisor, after my 3rd try because I was hung up on and then pushed back to the main menu, she basically told me that they aren't allowed to give 30 minutes and that if they call, they could be in my driveway calling. What? It's a bunch of ** and I still have no internet! I hate Comcast."
"Ann of Fredericksburg, VA",39995,0,"I called Comcast in May, because my internet was out. They scheduled someone to come out. I took off work and was home when the technician came out. He checked the internet in my home, changed a splitter, and told me that my signal was low at the outside box. He said that he would send someone out to boost the line. The service remained slow and/or not working.The first of June it went out again. I called, took off work, and the technician came. Said I had a low signal and that he would send someone out to boost the line. The same thing, slow service and or not working at all. At the end of June, it went out again. I called, took off work, technician said that the line has a low signal, he would send someone out to boost the cable. The next day, I received a bill from Comcast that was for the service calls to my home even though that problem was on their end. (They had told me that I would me credited for the time without service. I called and was told that I did not have to pay the service charge and that they would correct my bill. For me to call in a couple of days to see how much I owe).Yesterday, the cable was out again, I called, they said that they would send a technician out. I told them that it was unnecessary because the outside cable line just needs to be boosted. They said that they did not see it on my records and that I would have to take off another day of work and await the technician. I asked to speak to a supervisor. She said that everyone was busy and I left my number, no one called. I called again today. The supervisor said that a work order for cable boosting was never put in and that I had to have a technician come out again. I told her that I had a copy of the statement that the last technician had stated that the problem was the low signal. I told her that I could fax it to her, I also had the phone number of the technician. She said that she was sorry, but that I would have to take off another day of work and have a technician come out. I have never been treated so badly. I am changing cable companies."
"Teresa of Macomb, IL",39986,0,"I called up to get Comcast High-Speed Internet on 6/18. The technician arrived the next day (6/19) to install it, but ended up disconnecting my Dish Network wiring in order to use that to make the cable modem connection. I caught one of his errors while he was there when he disconnected the satellite feed to the room I was in. He indicated he could check to find the live cable feed, but alas, apparently chose not to.After he left, I then found another non-working satellite feed and called Dish Network and they came out on Monday (6/22) to track down the problem. You guessed it, the Comcast technician had disconnected another Dish Network cable to connect the modem. This one I just didn't catch before he left. All in all, I'm very dissatisfied. Not only was I charged $50 to have Comcast High-Speed Internet installed, I am also out the $49 it cost to have Dish send out a technician to resolve the issue your Comcast technician caused.And as you might guess, I am fed up with my Comcast experience and have canceled service (6/21). Someone is supposed to be by Tuesday (6/23) to pick up the cable modem. I am requesting that I don't get billed the $50 for the Comcast installation fee, nor any of the $36.99 initial monthly fee for the Comcast Internet Service. It will be interesting to see if I get a response. At the very least, call it lesson learned and never again will I consider Comcast for anything."
"Barbara of Seattle, WA",39982,0,"I signed up for Comcast High Speed Internet at $19.99 per month for one year. This is still their advertised special. I received it at $29.99 per month. I explained that the $29.99 was neither the rate I was quoted nor the advertised rate. They refused to lower the rate. Additionally, the modem that serves both my internet connection and my existing phone service stops working several times per day and must be reset. This is a problem they are unable to fix. I am willing to accept the below par phone service but I feel the $10.00 difference between the advertised high speed internet rate and the billed rate is unfair. No damage, these people just waste time and wear me out."
"Clay of Cartersville, GA",39973,0,"My internet has not been working properly for three months. Every time I call Comcast, they tell me to disconnect the modem and router to troubleshoot properly. I have done this numerous times. The internet is still not working. Comcast sent a technician to troubleshoot the issue. He said their signal was low and he would correct the problem. The internet does not work, again. Problem not solved!I changed the router and modem. Problem not solved. My neighbors say they are experiencing the same issue. I called Comcast and told them that my internet is not working and I would like a credit for the two months that it was not working. They said they will only issue one month's credit. I spoke to two different supervisors, and the last one I spoke with said I could not talk to her manager. She said she was the last step in the resolution process. Total crap! What kind of business is this? I am now cancelling my service with Comcast and going a different route. They have the most terrible service I have ever seen in my life!"
"Vishal of Mount prospect, IL",39970,0,"I ordered a Comcast high speed internet connection. This was long time back. I went out of town for six months for work related reason and my internet connection setup was never completed. I spoke to Gavan, one of the customer service agent on June 5th 2009 to set up internet connection at my place and had really bad customer service experience with him. He started yelling at me on the call with high tone (high voice). When I asked for supervisor (Michael), Michael also supported him saying, ""I know he was yelling at you,"" and acknowledged that he was standing next to him when he was doing so. Michael, being a team lead never apologized or tried convincing me. Instead, I hear his voice was too supportive for Gavan. I am very disappointed with this call and customer service experience with the Comcast. I would never ever recommend anybody in future to go for this kind of service and end up with bad customer service like this. I know Comcast might not take this as important, as they would lose only one customer but like this, there will be several others who might be the victims of such bad customer service and may think the same way. I am now switching to another service provider. I already have a Comcast modem, (which I paid $60 just for modem + shipping), which I purchased while placing an order. I wanted my money back but Comcast customer service is not even accepting the modem back. I was warned by my friends not to go with Comcast because they had bad experience with Comcast before but it was all my mistake or I would say ""wrong choice"". I don't know how to escalate this to the upper management in Comcast."
"Nicholas of Greensburg, PA",39970,0,"I was out of town on a business trip. I knew there was some kind of issue with my Internet when I could not remotely connect to my home computer. When I returned home from the trip, I was without service on my Internet, phone/fax and television. I called the Comcast number and was told that they would get right back to me with a time that a service technician could look at my service. I waited 4 hours and didn't receive a call. I called back and was told that it would possibly be 3 days until they could come. I asked to speak to a supervisor and explained to him that my office is at my home and I was losing business time related to the outage. He was quite rude. I then drove to the local office and was told again that they would call me to tell me when a representative could provide the service. Twenty-four hours later, no call and no service."
"David of Aurora, co",39966,0,"This company has been not sending out regular bills to me monthly, which means I get late/disconnect notices and phony late charges. They also have not been posting my payments! I feel my information and or checking account could be compromised. This is very troubling that they can get away with this sort of thing! I have 2 other complaints pending with them as it is! My bill has tripled now! They say I owe them over $140-plus. My monthly bill is $45.00! Times are stressing enough without garbage like this going on! I will be filing for compensation!"
"Alan of Hayward, CA",39966,0,"I have been a long time customer of Comcast Internet and I have noticed some inequities that Comcast is offering involving their Internet service. It appears that in some areas, they are now offering a 12 mbps speed at an introductory offer at $19.99 for 6 months. Then it will return to the $42.95 a month that I am currently spending for only 6 mbps and the new rate will not be available in my area until 12/09 per Comcast representative. When I asked for an adjustment to at least the $19.99 for the 6 mbps, I was told that Comcast has only one base rate. This doesn't seem fair at all. Something needs to be done about this cavalier attitude towards consumers."
"M of Denver, CO",39963,0,"I signed up for 1 year promo of cable and high speed internet for $24.95 a month. I should have realized it was a scam. A technician came out a week ago and did the install. Everything was fine. A week later and I can't get Comcast internet to stay online now. I called, did live chat and finally had to reinstall my Cricket USB modem. Wow! Cricket is working and Comcast isn't. I guess it's true that you get what you pay for. I'm just glad Comcast hasn't charged me as much as the other people on here. I'm giving them 2 more weeks and if they can't get it fixed, I'll switch to Qwest. Qwest has a pretty good promo right now too."
"Marilyn of Boca Raton, FL",39959,0,"On April 20, 2009 continuing to the present date, I have been experiencing rolling ""blackouts"" of internet service that I pay for from Comcast. I have called them 6 times in the last 6 weeks, have had technicians to my home that claim nothingŠ—Ès wrong, and yet I continue to have denial of service with no explanation from Comcast. Approximately every 5 to 10 minutes, my internet connection is ""cut off"". The TV signal is fine. I continue to pay $30 a month for internet service that is completely unstable with no explanation from Comcast. Every time I am disconnected from the internet, around every 5 minutes, I lose whatever I was working on at the moment. I have lost thousands of dollars being cut off from my online stock brokerage account. There is no way to recover from the losses."
"Joe of Fremont, CA",39953,0,"Do any people still remember when Comcast bought AT&T internet, it raised up price immediately? I bought my 1st Motorola modem and it caused many disconnections after 1-2 years, thus I bought a 2nd RCA modem and used it another 2-3 years. And again, I need to reset the modem a few times a day. Each call to Comcast is a long time waste. I then turned over to DSL and it works 1-2 years and I reset it only once.I used to tent their cable modem for a short time then use one I bought from eBay. After 2 years, Comcast suddenly started to charge my rental free and asked me to return my modem. I called in and went in and they checked with the warehouse. A lady said I was correct yet manager said the case was not completed yet. A bad thing was when I returned the rented modem, nobody gave me a receipt. This time, I was forced to give them my modem and a kind lady did give me a receipt. But I still keep all PayPal records so that I may dig out my purchase record."
"Darrell of Merrillville, IN",39953,0,"My internet service with Comcast was disconnected for one year because Comcast claims that I was using too much bandwidth. I had been warned before but the person I talked to told me to purchase bandwidth monitoring software. If Comcast wants their customers to stay within certain limits, then they should provide bandwidth monitoring software. I should not have to purchase something like that myself. It should be provided by Comcast. When I opened my cellular account, I purchased a specific number of minutes that I can use every month. Whenever I want to find out how many minutes I have used, all I have to do is sign into my account and I can find out how many minutes I have used. Comcast does not have any such tool."
"Jennifer of West Jordan, UT",39946,0,"We signed up for Comcast in May of 2008. We asked if the price was promotional, who doesn't now, and we remember being told it wasn't. Last week we talked to a Jennifer, and her supervisor, they were going to look up sign up phone call and see if we had asked about promotional price. They also said they would call us back - like I believe that. Today I was told by Amy, ""The supervisor was unable to pull the phone conversation. These are usually 6 month promotional so don't complain about rate increases.""Well, I am complaining. If you look at their ads on their website, we could only find one that said it was a promotional offer. Most of them never mentioned that the offer was limited. Our bill never showed promotional as we saw with our DirecTV bill. It never showed a promotional discount or anything that could have brought our attention to this situation earlier. I have looked into other Internet providers and they are the only one that isn't a dial up, available to me. We never signed anything but the work paper that said the installers have fixed any damages to my yard. My sprinklers were only fixed after 4 days of phone calls."
"Lisa of Soquel, CA",39944,0,"I just realized my Comcast high-speed internet bill has practically doubled. When I signed up for it, no one from Comcast ever told me that the rate would increase. When I complained about this, the Comcast rep said that the service tech (who is a local contractor and not a Comcast employee) who installed it would have told us that the $42 was a promotional rate. I told the Comcast rep that I was not even home when internet was installed, so the rep then told me that the service tech (again, a non-Comcast employee) left information that said that the $42 a month was only a 6-month promotional cost. Why didn't Comcast tell me that when I was signing up for their service? Why does Comcast rely on a local contractor who is not even a Comcast employee to inform of forthcoming changes on my bill? I want to know why, when I was on the phone signing up for Comcast internet, that I was never told about the price increase. This is not right! I think that it is totally unfair that when I was on the phone signing up for the internet, a Comcast rep told me it was going to be $42 a month. They never said it was a promotional rate and was going to jump to $72. I think Comcast should tell you that when you are signing up for their service."
"Luke of St. Paul, MN",39944,0,"I had trouble with internet connection for more than five days. I found that I could not connect internet from May 1st. I waited for the line to come back one day and I reported this trouble on May 2nd, very early in the morning. At the first call, I was told that I had to change the modem, so I dropped by a Comcast service center and changed the modem. But the trouble continued, so I called again. At that time I was told that there might be some trouble in our area, so I wait for about 4 hours and try connecting the internet. But after 4 and more hours, there was still no internet connection, so I called again. At this call, I was again told that the trouble might be a regional so I wait for more time and contact them. But the internet line never came alive.So I called again the next day (May 3rd) and scheduled someone to come over. Someone scheduled (Tuesday) May 5th for service, which was according to him, the earliest day possible. On the service day, the person came could not find the trouble and scheduled another service for the next day (May 6th). On Wednesday afternoon, finally, the service people could find the problem. The total time I could not access to the internet was more than 120 hours.After all of this trouble, I called Comcast for asking credit or refund for not being able to use internet for those days, as I told from one of the representatives I talked with. A billing representative I talked with told me that I could get 2 days of credit, which is about 2 dollars something cents. I explained her that the service could not be used for more than 5 days, but she said according to the record, she could just give me 2 days of credit. Maybe they counted only Monday and Tuesday because I reported trouble on Sunday and it was fixed on Wednesday.I could not use internet for 5 days and also the cable reception was not that good either during the time. I did not hear sincere apology or any care for my inconvenience. I even had to call to get refund, but all I could get was 2 days of credit and that is less than $3! I think I have to quit my Comcast service, and I'll tell all the people I know about this story so that they would know about Comcast more."
"Jason of Eugene, OR",39943,0,"I called Comcast to report an intermediate outage with my high-speed internet service and speed problem. The first time I called, I was told nothing was wrong. I knew that wasn't true. I have major issues with my line speed and when they come out, it's early and they said, ""You're not going to get any better than that. I'm sorry, sir."" Whatever. I have never experienced this slow of speed for six years of having their service at other addresses. And if it does not get fixed very soon, I am canceling my service and going elsewhere. I have been paying top dollar for crap and it's not worth paying as much as I do to deal with their stupidity. Their techs are very unprofessional. If it's not my house, grab your ladder and check the line in from the pole. I say it's pure lazy. They look around, don't test anything or make sure everything is tight. Then they leave and it messes up over and over again."
"Rob of Abingdon, MD",39939,0,"I called Comcast to report an outage with my high-speed Internet service. The first time I called, I was told nothing was wrong. I knew that wasn't true due to experiencing it for a while at that point. I called the next morning. I was told the agent saw my signal problem and would schedule a tech visit. She tried to schedule it for Friday but that was ""already taken"" when she tried. So, the next appointment that would be able to fit my schedule was Tuesday between 5 PM and 8 PM. I did that because my wife and I both work and that was a time I knew we would both be there. The agent came before 3 PM, said nobody was there so the appointment was canceled. I called to complain and was told no appointments for my account were seen but a street service call had been made for my street and he would have tech come to my door. That never happened. I called today to get an update on what the street call discovered. There was nothing there regarding it and the only help I was going to get was to schedule another service call on Friday between 2 PM and 5 PM, which means on my day off, I have to sit in my house and wait for somebody to maybe show up. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told supervisors don't take calls and I would need to leave a message and get a call back. Of course, I was told a supervisor couldn't help. It has been a week now with these issues and no resolutions. My account has poor documentation and service calls I requested aren't showing on it.My Internet service is still spotty. My cable modem, which is five years old and out-dated technology, needs to be replaced and the tech should be doing that along with checking everything from my house out to the road. I am not required to take time out of my day to get a new cable modem and get it set up or take time out of my day to sit and wait for a tech who may not show up. All this time, I am not getting the service I am paying for each month."
"Alaina of Atlanta, GA",39934,0,"I recently disconnected my internet and phone service with AT&T due to telephone issues. I switched to Comcast ""high-speed"" internet and cable TV. I have only had the service for a few months and already I've called and contacted customer service almost 7 times! Ridiculous! Either my cable TV signal is screwy or the on-demand will not pull up. Now my Comcast ""high-speed"" internet is the slowest it's ever been! AT&T is better people! Seriously, I never had problem with their internet service and now I'm seriously considering switching back. Comcast is a joke. Their commercials are false and their internet is the worst I've ever had! Either it disconnects halfway through or it takes 10 minutes or more to connect, period! Getting from page to page is a hassle. I have to continuously refresh the page and retry! I've tried everything, even their McAfee security which is also a joke. My laptop is only 6 months old! My hard drive is clean and it runs smoothly without the internet. But every time I get online, it's one headache after another. I'm seriously fed up and their customer service rep on their online chat disconnected from me after she read my complaint. How rude! They are ignoring my complaints and have yet to find a solution! AT&T is so much better."
"Alexa of Vallejo, CA",39930,0,"We signed a contract with Comcast for phone and internet service in June 2008. Since then, we have been continuously overcharged and ignored, even though we saved all contractual documents. When we show up in person at a Comcast store, we are dismissed and told to call the 1-800 number. When we call the 1-800 number, we are told they can't help us because they can't see the contractual documents that we have, yet they won't provide a phone, fax, or mailing address to send copies. If this were a small business, it would be an easy legal suit. Comcast is so large and unorganized that each time I speak to someone new, most, if not all, of the notes on our account have ""disappeared"" and they aren't even sure who I've spoken to before or who made changes to my account. This is ridiculous. We've wasted countless hours trying to rectify the situation and whenever we are told the situation will be fixed and the credit will be applied to our account, it does not appear and those notes disappear. I am not sure what their employees are paid to do because they can never help us, and sometimes they flat out lie. It's disgusting that big businesses can get away with practices like this. I'm just waiting to receive my credit and cancel service."
"Joseph of Houston, TX",39929,0,"Out of the blue, my internet and home phone service with Comcast went out. Occasionally, a quick reset of the modem takes care of everything. This wouldn't come back on. I called the service people, who advertise their 24/7 availability, and was told that although they were still there, it was late in the day on Friday and nothing would be done. I was told at first that nothing would be done until Monday. Since the phone service includes 911, I protested. The representative told me my claim had been escalated and that someone would call me the next day (Saturday) and also visit that day to fix everything.Having heard nothing by nearly noon on Saturday, I called again. A representative tried to reset the system again and then told me when that failed that the service people would call me within 30 minutes. After an hour, nothing. My service came back on briefly and then disappeared again. I called Comcast again and someone reset the system again and I had service briefly. He apologized but didn't get in touch with anyone at service and more or less hung up before I could ask for a supervisor. My system went down yet again. I called Comcast and finally someone explained to me that the previous employee had lied to me or misled me about the way service works and that no one was ever going to just come out the next day or call within 30 minutes. While I appreciated his honesty, when I complained about the lack of 911 service, he told me, ""You don't want your service on so you can call 911"" and continued to refer to my outage as an inconvenience. No one anticipates calling 911. I've had to do it several times from my home, and I expect that a company that promises services I use for personal, business and emergency reasons will provide those services and not expect me to wait 72 hours to have them returned. The system has flickered back on, but no one has explained why this happened or made sure it won't happen again. At this point, I am in an agreement with a cancellation fee before two years, but I feel that Comcast should waive the fee. I'm certainly canceling my service. I'd recommend everyone be very careful about this company. Their promises are tantalizing but their service is reprehensible."
"Vickie of Fishers, IN",39927,0,"Our cable, internet, and phone service are terrible. After five missed appointments, I stopped the phone service. The technician never showed! He dropped off the modem and I installed it. We have cable internet only sporadically and they again can't send a technician. They can't fix it over the phone. I pay my bill every month for service we cannot enjoy. The cable TV works, but is often snowy when the service is interrupted. I can't conduct my business so I have to use a local copy center for internet access. We watch videos and buy the paper since we can't watch TV. They know I don't have any options and are so arrogant when I call for help. "
"Steve of Cumming, GA",39926,0,"Comcast Internet double charged me on my internet. When I contacted them, they told me to adjust my bill and send in payment. I did, they cut off my service without calling and notifying me. When I contacted to explain the situation for the 5th time including hold times over 45 min., they told me to pay the full bill and they would credit my account the next bill. I explained again that Jerrod, operator **, told me to pay the amount I owed. Their excuse again was to pay all the over charges and they would correct it on the next bill. Their customer service is the worst unless you're off the coast of Somalia and dealing with pirates. This has not been the only problem with service. Phone has gone down several times. This is also a business line. Warning, stay away from Comcast."
"Joseph of Fort Wayne, IN",39911,0,"As I sit here waiting for a supervisor to get expedited service, I'm using my cell phone, of course, at my cost. I've been watching my modem reset every 5 minutes or so for the past hour, rendering internet access and home phone service virtually nonexistent. Yes, I made the mistake of getting all 3 services from Comcast. My telephone constantly drops calls, so my home phone service - a vital necessity - doesn't work. Last Friday, on a business call, it dropped 4 times in 1/2 hour. About 2 weeks ago, a service call was scheduled, but no one showed. I learned that if you're not home to take a recorded pre-service call the night before, the service call is cancelled. It's now been 15 minutes on my cell, and no supervisor has answered. As of now, my service is set for Friday morning - that's 2 1/2 days with a modem that resets every few minutes and no consistent phone service. This is what you have to look forward to with Comcast.

"Carmen of Dickson, TN",39910,0,"On 04/03/09, my email was not working so I called Comcast. They let me know that there was a problem with their service and they apologized. Shortly after that, a Comcast tech showed up here at my home to fix my computer (which by the way I did not order but since he was here, I figured it was a plus since he could now fix the problem). He asked what was the trouble. I explained that my email was not working so he proceeded to try and fix the problem. But instead, he and someone he contacted at Comcast decided that the way to resolve my problem was to change my email; he never asked me if it would be alright. By doing this they did away with my existing email which by the way I've had for 15 years and all my friends, family, banks, doctors and all the businesses I do business with cannot get in touch with me. Now Travis said that all I had to do was set up another email account. That is easy for him to say since it was not causing any problems for him. Here it is 4/6/09 in the evening and I still do not have my email back. They keep telling me they are working on it but nothing has been corrected as of yet. I've left a message for him (Travis **) but I still have not heard from him either. I am very frustrated and upset. I understand that this should never have happened, because no one has the right to change your email without permission. Someone forgot to tell Travis."

Six times in a row now my phone has went dead and my internet connection dropped in the middle of my shift. I called comcast today and they told me it was due to service maintenance and would occur on a regular basis - normally late at night (during my work shift). This is unacceptable to me! I have used other internet and phone service providers who have NEVER caused any service interruptions due to maintenance. They either need to lower my payments for my service or figure out how other companies do their maintenance without causing these interruptions! It's not like the service goes down for only 10 minutes - it takes hours!Since this is occurring during my work hours, it is causing me to lose money and also causing my managers to think of me as being unreliable. If it happens again, I may just be out of a job and who needs that right now during this recession?"
"Alpesh of San Jose, CA",39897,0,The comcast claims to provide a very high speed internet service. I have purchased their 12Mbs internet service package.

Lately comcast internet speed is very slow. I tried to call the customer service and they didn't help at all. I kept on calling multiple times and problem hasn't been resolved.  They claim to provide highest internet speed. All their commercial focuses on speed.  I am getting 54kbs internet speed. I am paying for 12Mbs. Their customer support was unable to help. I plan to switch to other internet service provider. It is painful to switch service to other provider and waste of my time and money.

I got a phone call from her today, as she had promised.  She informed me that they were putting a $250 credit onto my account.  At least this was handled the right way, and they didn't offer me 18 months of a pay channel that I don't watch anyway.

About 2 months ago Comcast sent me a notice saying they were charging me the wrong price for my service and would be making changes. I don't remember verbetum what the letter said, but it did say that if I was willing to add Television and Phone to my service package I could get a reduced price on the Highspeed internet. When I got my new bill, not only did my rate go up, but the megabyte per second speed went down to 4mbps from 6mbps. Plus, they prorated me for half a month?! I believe there are some unfair pricing practices going on. I feel like I am essentially being blackmailed into using Comcast's TV & Phone coverage just to keep a decent price for Highspeed Internet service.

I downloaded their McAfee Security Suite that they offer to high speed internet customers. Along with crashing my hard drive and fracturing my registry, I lost my computer for 10 days. I had a Comcast tech come out to the house and within 2 minutes proved to me that it was not a Comcast issue, but my computer was trashed. I got on the phone with Comcast the day I got my computer back, and told them that a product that they are offering on their website caused my computer to fail. I told them that I felt that the $250 to repair my computer should be given back to me. The woman agreed and told me that the Claims Division will get to me within 72 hours. The claims person, John, did get back to me, and asked me to fax him the copy of my invoice for my repair. I also wrote him a statement of facts as a timeline so he could see what happened. I wrote on my cover letter, Please call me to let me know that you have received all pages in good order. I never received a phone call back. While trying to get in touch with him again, Comcast is unable to give a direct number to their Claims Department. In fact, I can't find anything online or over the phone for it. I sent the same faxes again, only this time, I made the Call me back statement huge and bold. Again, I never received a call. I had to go out of my way to my local Comcast office, and pleaded with the person to give me John and his supervisor's email address so I could get in touch with them. He does it, and wouldn't you know, the email address is inter-office only and doesn't allow outside email addresses in. Today, I sent a fax in 56 point font saying, Would John or Julie please call me at the number listed below. Guess what, no phone call today. I am at the point where I think that legal action is my only resort. Their complete lack of customer service is horrendous. I'm not asking them to put a man on the moon, I'm asking them to call me back and let me know that they received my faxes. Claims like this always seem to be lost or we never received it. My next move tomorrow is to call and cancel my service. Maybe then I will get an answer.$250 for repairing my laptop. 10 days of no computer, and no ability to keep an update of my work status (Union worker) Too many hours on the phone or online trying to get somebody to answer my simple questions, only to get re-routed to another generic 1-800-COMCAST phone number that says the same things to me that I've already heard 5 times that day."

"R of Eugene, OR",39880,0,"I recently upgraded my internet service with Comcast to there 12 MBPS offering from their dumbed down 1 MBPS service.   For a week now I have tried to have them show me proof that I am actually getting 12 MBPS.  Consistently for the last week, various speeed tests that I have performed on multiple web sites have never produced a download speed greater than 960 KBPS.  Comcast reps consistently state that I have the 12 MBPS service but always avoid the question when I ask for proof.  I examined all the hardware, checked the connections, I am using there modem, so that is not an issue. They installed the lines just over a year ago, the computers get higher donwload speeds at other locations (non Comcast).    I think they are scamming people by selling a service that they are not actually offering.  Selling 12 MBPS when they are only supplying 1 MBPS is wrong.  They should be penalized for this business practice if in fact this is what they are doing and should have to reimburse if they have been deceitful in there practices.  I am requesting more comments and investigation into there practices...   Major waste of time, performance of my system.  There is no physical damage and the economic damage is somewhat intangible.  Maybe this is why they get away with it, because they know that the complaint process is cumbersome and most will acquiesce before going to the trouble."
"Ashutosh of Somerset, NJ",39880,0,"I am facing some issues with Comcast. I started their bundle services from July 2008 at $59.99. After some time the voice quality on the phone was very bad. It has frequent drop calls and sometimes the numbers are not getting dialed also. As a result i want to get it disconnected. When i called Comcast Customer Service, I was told that i cannot do that-if i do i need to pay the same price($59.99) for my comcast internet and that will be a lower speed internet(1X). Right now i m using double bundle with the comcast modem and the monthly bill comes out to be around $70.00  So is it okay that they charge $59.99 for the lower speed internet? I am asking to disconnect the phone which is having a lot of issues.  My next door neighbor is just using the comcast high speed internet and paying only $24.95. When i compared my speed via speed test, he is having the same speed that i am getting. So here Comcast is fooling people-I am getting the 1X speed even when they it's 6X. When i told comcast customer service that this option is available to have only high speed internet rather than both the services, they turned down my request for that also. They say we don't have that promotion now and i have to pay $59.99 even if i just use the so called High speed internet from Comcast. It's irony that everytime i call customer service I get different answers. Whatever they commit on the phone call, they are not ready to follow after a day itself. Very bad experience till now.My monthly bill from Comcast comes out to be around $70(with a lot of taxes etc..). On top of it because of this bad comcast phone, I need to buy a cell phone which I need to pay around $74 per month. I should have been paying only $24.95 with taxes it comes out to be around $28. So every month I am paying an additional $42.00 more for a lousy phone service."
"Laurie of Brighton, CO",39880,0,"Arnold is but one of a few poorly trained service representatives we have had to deal with in our relationship with Comcast Cable.  We switched to their high-speed broadband Internet service about two years ago. Things were fine until about six months ago when the modum (leased from Comcast) died.  Since then we have had to replace the modem twice and had a new cable hooked up to the house by various technician.  The latest modem (#3) died a few days ago. I called their Customer Service and they tried to fix it over the phone and finally said we had no connection. We had two options.  A technician could come and fix the problem or we could unhook the modem and take it to a Comcast payment center and have it replaced at no charge.  We went to the payment center and Arnold gave us a different modem.  I asked if it was new and he said it was a refurbished one from their warehouse. I also told him this was the third modem we had in six months.  His reply was that he had also had problems with his modem from Comcast and when he switched to their phone service, no more problems. We tried to hook up the new modem and power cord.  Comcast said to call them after we hooked it up.  We got no signal, so we called.  We talked to a very nice CSR named Tanya.  After several minutes she found out the reason we had no signal, noone had scanned our current modem into their system.  She took the time to do this.  I also found out that the servic call in which Comcast had installed a new cable to our house (which was supposed to be done at no charge per the technician who did the work) had been charged to our bill.  This work was done in January.  We did not receive a statment from Comcast in February.  When we did receive the March statement it had a $27 service call and also a late fee of @$6 added onto to our bill.  Tanya said we shouldn't have been charged for the service call and waived it.  She also waived the late fee and we had always paid our bill on time in the past.  We now have a working modem (for how long, who knows). I took the old power cord back the Arnold at the payment center.  He said I noticed that you had a service call and late payment waived from your account.  He said, See, we are working for you.  I told him we also had to wait for the new modem to be scanned into the system before it could be activated and the only reason the other items were waived is because we called and pointed it out to Comcast.  Arnold said, Have a nice day! Are we fortunate to pay Comcast $60/month for this frustration and lousy service.Each time we have had to contact Comcast, it takes us 2-3 including the wait for either a technician or CSR (who usually speaks English as a second language, which is hard to understand)to try and take care of the problem.  We don't get any monetary compensation from Comcast for the time we spend fixing their problems.  If we have any other problem, we will be switching to another company.  Unfortunately, their service will probably be the same.  So sad for the American consumer.  A sign of the times."
"Lisa of Oakland, CA","Feb. 28, 2009",0,"I have had Comcast service since it first took over AT&T cable. As their product offering increading their service has deterioratad.

They also gave me a 'introductory' cable/ internet rate and was told i could modify it in the future as needed. Possible even obtain 'a la carte' services.  Today i was told that wasn't possible and could only downgrade to 20 channels for $15 or pay the $60. What? $15 or $60, where is the in between?!!! Then my internet service is not tiered at speeds, this was never the case before. We paid a flat fee for flat service. It's either $24 for 1mb or $45.95 for 6mb. Comcast is forcing consumers to bare bone service or excessive pricing.  Unless you choose to Bundle all three of their services.

"Phillip of Aptos, CA","Feb. 14, 2009",0,"We are very concerned about the practice of updating or changing formats on the website with no explanation of how to use them. For example, the new SmartZone for the Comcast email just showed up one day. There was no explanation of how to use it and it is very confusing, especially at first. We were able to figure most of it out over several days but some things needed to be fixed by the service rep and we had no way of knowing that. After 40 minutes on the phone to Comcast with a service rep, many changes in the format by the rep, and some terse exchanges, we are finally (maybe) able to use our email effectively. This is not an acceptable way to do business. We pay a lot of money every month for this service, and it is inexcusable to make it harder and harder, with no explanation as to how to use the upgrades. You know, there are many of us who did not grow up with computers who really do need a simple explanation when things are changed. This would be the minimum expectation for any business."

"Stacey of Wilmington, DE","Feb. 7, 2009",0,"This company apparently tries to make money by fooling people. In two locations where I have had their internet service, the signal strength would fluctuate and the service would be intermittent. Countless hours were spent on the phone to resolve it and waiting for technicians to come one after another to all do different simple things that did not work to resolve the problem. There were sometimes charges for this and no, none of it was related to wiring inside my walls as they would like to occasionally assert. They are quick to try to sell you the service protection plan, from which they get a guaranteed revenue stream. I am not sure but I would like to know if they can manipulate your signal from their remote location because every time I have called for this problem, ironically within a minute of having someone on the line, all the lights on the modem shine solidly! I'm venturing a guess that they cause these situations purposely in order to convince people they need the protection plan and more profit for them!"

I told them that when I set up the account, I was never told that. Plus, I had to pay a $50 installation charge. To make matters worse, during the time I was being billed, I couldn't even use the internet!!! Every month I called and they said they would credit my account when the problem was fixed.The problem was NEVER fixed. The Comcast representative stated that since there was no contract, they could charge me whatever they wanted. And even though they have record of my account never being used, they still billed me for the service. I told the rep that I have six kids and I would never sign into an agreement for $60 a month for internet when I could get it from Verizon for $15 a month.

I use my internet for everything, as a phone, for my emails, to check train or bus schedules, etc. Now, without warning, Comcast has upped my internet bill to over $50 a month, and on my already stretched budget, I'm going to have to cancel my only means of communication. Comcast claims that they upped the bill to cope with new changes they made to my service, but I honestly feel that is a hollow lie to mask the utter greed that motivated this decision."
"Adam of New Bedford, MA","Jan. 28, 2009",0,"An open letter to Comcast:I have received terrible customer service from Comcast while trying to attain service. I already have Comcast service in IL and I am attempting to receive it in MA. I have been a customer for 4 years and will soon have two accounts. While attempting to obtain service in MA, I was disconnected from the ""installation"" department twice - requiring me to make a total of three calls, totaling 1.5 hours. Once I received a service ""order confirmation"" I was told the technician could be expected between 3 and 7 pm on Wednesday, January 28th, 2009 and that the technician could call 15 minutes in advance of the service appointment. Several days later I received a call from a call center (possibly in India and Sri Lanka) where a gentleman informed me I had not set up a service call yet. To double check this, I called back the ""installation department"" and confirmed the appointment, taking approximately another 40 mins. On the day of the service appointment, I receive a call at 11 a.m. from a ""technician"" who explained that he would like to perform the services earlier because of other cancellations. I explained that this was not possible as I was working at that time and that after his other appointments, he should call me 15 minutes before he was able to perform the service - as I was told was possible by the ""installation department."" He called me at 3:48 p.m. and said he had called me 0.5 hours earlier, which my call logs document was not the case. He said that he had been there since 3 p.m. on the dot and that I was not there - which made no sense since he would likely have called me at 3 p.m., more like 45 minutes prior. I told him I would be there in 15 minutes, at about 3:53 p.m. by that point, making my arrival at 4:08 p.m. possible. He said he would be there. When I got there at 4:08 p.m., he was nowhere to be found. After this I called him on the number he had called me on and he said I would have to call dispatch to have him sent back on a new call to my house. I called for dispatch and was told by 800-Comcast that they, dispatch, would be in touch in 30 mins, approximately 4:45 p.m. At 5:25 p.m., I received a call from dispatch, more than an hour later, and was told that nothing could be done. I wasn't getting service that day. Also, I was told that they, dispatch and installation in this area, don't perform service calls during the 3 to 7 p.m. time frame I was allotted by the ""installation department"" and that they don't call customers to let them know they are coming. But evidently they call customers to see if they can inconvenience them and come early.So I ask you sirs, how can a company with such grand resources and such cutting edge, ""high-speed"" technology be so unprofessional? Why does the left hand not know what the right hand is doing and why is the customer the victim of these inconsistencies? So, here I am, using the internet I have to get through my blue-tooth tethered cell phone to complain about services I was promised by Comcast in the hopes that my comments will be heard. I am using up more of my valuable time on this earth complaining about simple things that Comcast should be able to accommodate. After these troubles, I am contemplating canceling all Comcast service, on both accounts, and choosing another television/internet service provider that will perhaps value its customers more. Thank you very much for your time.I never received any response from them and their comments are limited to 1500 characters. Also, no one at 800-Comcast would transfer me to complaints or customer care type departments."

"Walter of Naples, FL","Jan. 24, 2009",0,"As a Comcast high speed internet subscriber, I have complained all the time to Comcast reps that my connection speed are very slow. Instead of 5Mbs I only get around 1Mbs, but since three weeks it escalated that I only have at random times for a few hours internet connection at all. I call every single day and every time I get an apology and they send techs out to the street, sometimes up to two trucks and 5 techs then the connection works for a few hours and we start over again, no connection. It is not just me, it is the whole neighborhood with about 30 customers and even 10 of their phone customers have no connection. They can not even dial 911. They charge a lot of money and provide the most unreliable service I have ever experienced."

"Robert of Monroe Twp, NJ","Jan. 21, 2009",0,"I signed up for Comcast Triple Play several months ago and was supposed to get high-speed internet as part of the package for $33/month for a year. My latest bill now has two line items under Comcast High-Speed Internet, both called Blast! One line is for $33 and the second line is for $10. When I called to inquire about the $10 charge, I was told it was part of the high speed internet package. I asked if that is different from the original package I signed up for and she said, ""No, it isn't."" I have no recourse but to pay the additional $10/ month. I have nothing in writing that defines the package I originally purchased. Advice to Comcast customers: When you buy a service from Comcast, get an itemized list that defines exactly what is included in your purchase and how much you will be charged for it per month."
"Charlene of Minneapolis, MN","Jan. 20, 2009",0,"I was a happy internet user from 4-30-08 to 8-15-08. Wanted to upgrade my system with a phone system that also included a fax line. Needed this due to starting a small business at home that would also include e-commerce online business. Well, on 8-15-08 they came to install the phone system. The guy could not get it done, left for 2hrs and came back with another tech, and finally they got something going but it still was not 100% okay. When the 2nd tech came, he asked for my modem. I gave it to him and they went to the pickup... I never saw it again. Then I was not getting all my calls - it would send them to voicemail. I could not use my fax line to send or receive faxes. I told them about this. On 9-3, when I paid on the account, I paid $40 on the internet account so I told her. As time went on, nobody contacted me at all... Then in 10-7-08, I had minor surgery that turned into major sickness... And about the 12th or sometime, someone finally called... 30 days after reporting the problem. I told her I was too sick to talk, give me a number and I would call her back... She did. Then I called her back on 10-15-08. The lady who called was out, so we talked to the one who answered. Of course, she knew nothing and said she would have the lady call me back. On 10-21-08 they turned off the service. Also, when the installed the phone, they did not tell me they were combining both internet and phone on one line. I wanted them separate. After all, I had the internet since 4-30-08 and wanted that regardless of the phone... Yes, without ever getting back to me to see what the problem was, they turned off all the services.I was still ailing from this surgery, but made it over to St. Paul and took another letter of Dispute & Complaint about the service. I gave it to Kathy ** and she saw I was not feeling well. She promised she would take care of it and get my service back on. When I got home, the service was on (11-7-08). However, that following Monday, 11-10-08, it was turned off again. Liz, a tech, came out late that afternoon to check it out... No service. She could not do her job. She called and told them that... They just told her to leave, saying I OWED... A LIE! She apologized and said to get in touch with the president, inform him and go from there.. she could not do any more. Again, they never contacted me to get it corrected or anything. Then I got injured in an accident in November and could not continue the fight with them. I did not really recover from these injuries until the new year of January 2009. On November 26, 2008 I faxed Jeff ** a Letter of Dispute, informing him what I had been through and needed corrected. Then they finally began to contact me, but of course I had no phone, no way to be contacted and was out when they called. I tried to contact the person, but had no luck. Then when I called them on 1/9, the contact person was not there, etc. Then a John ** came out and talked with me. I showed him everything and he said they would get it fixed. That was it. Time.. time.. nothing. Then when I finally did get someone, he knew nothing about all of it. They wanted me to PAY again for another installation. I said, ""NO, your system DID NOT WORK CORRECTLY... NO, the equipment was defective."" They changed 3 boxes before it worked at all.Then on top of that, my modem had been stolen and taken, and zip about returning it. This has been a nightmare. I had a website to upload e-commerce to in order to make a nice income, so I can get off SS. Then I got 2 unsigned letters from Comcast stating all they did, etc. But nothing about any mistakes, defective equipment, what it had cost me, etc... No they have done nothing wrong, etc. They considered this matter closed... Yeah, I guess so. They never do anything right as I am told by everybody else here. Here I sit, nothing... Everything cut off and they will not budge to correct what they DID wrong. I want my internet, regardless, but I am not going to pay for something they CUT OFF that I have not used... Please HELP ME so I can get my website made and make some decent income. This has caused me many sleepless nights, emotional upsetness, brought me to a standstill, and I can do absolutely nothing for my business. Please HELP!"
"Stephen of Dublin, CA","Jan. 17, 2009",0,"Comcast Broadband Internet access has become so slow and unreliable that any Internet search or browsing has become extremely frustrating and wasteful of time. I use it for working at home, which means occasional attendance or presentation of webcasts. With the high UNRELIABILITY of Comcast, this has severely affected my work productivity. It will also ADVERSELY affect America's work productivity in this digital age. This is forcing me to look for slower but more reliable alternatives like Satellite Broadband, DSL or 3G mobile modem."
"Edward of Naples, FL","Jan. 17, 2009",0,"I am having a problem with very slow speed on the internet. In the past, it turned out that Comcast was upgrading and the service improved. Calls to Comcast prove worthless because personnel are not informed of internal service upgrades or problems. Generally, I ask where the operator is located; it's usually far away and operator is capable of sending serviceman to our home where he informs us that he cannot figure out the problem. This is my last complaint. If no satisfaction, I am moving to another service. I am not alone, neighbors report the same problem since January 14. What has happened to you?"
"Heather of Bellefonte, PA","Jan. 15, 2009",0,"About 6 months ago, I started noticing that my internet service would slow or stop. At that point, I called and they told me that the modem needed to be reset and i could do this by unplugging the modem and waiting 10 seconds. That would work, but only temporarily. More recently, while I've been trying to watch movies via Netflix on my computer, the connection would either slow considerably or stop completely. I called again and the operator said my connection wasn't being recognized. To fix that, she suggested I unplug the modem and disconnect the cable for about 30 seconds. That works, again temporarily. This has been happening at least 3 times every time I'm trying to use the computer, regardless of what task I'm trying to do."
"Stephen of South St. Paul, MN","Jan. 13, 2009",0,"I pay for high-speed internet access in South St. Paul Minnesota. Yet, the service I receive from Comcast is frequently slow or completely unavailable at times. I've called and also participated in live chats with Customer Support. They always assume that the problem is my computer or my router but none of these are problematic and my computer can access a high-speed WiFi network in other locations. The problem is the Comcast network. If I use the connection at 2 am, it works fine; if I use it during the day, I frequently encounter problems. Comcast is selling a high-speed system that is overused and therefore not functioning as they describe in their advertising. It's obvious that they must know this but they blame the consumer."
"Roger of Neptune Beach, FL","Jan. 12, 2009",0,"I'm paying for high-speed internet (5mbps) and am getting between 756 kbps and 1.4mbps. I contacted customer service and am told that they show the modem is receiving data at 5mbps. I disconnected the router, rebooted the modem, connected each of two available, re-booted computers directly to the modem and I'm still getting slow speeds (1.1mbps). Time to stop paying for high speed broadband and go to AT&T DSL, which costs half the money and still provides speeds in excess of what Comcast's high speed connection actually delivers. This is a bad company that cheats its customers and really needs to be put out of business..."
"Marciana of Boca Raton, FL","Jan. 9, 2009",0,"I moved to Boca Raton two months ago. I had high speed internet for many years. However, in Boca Raton, they are advertising high speed for $34.00 a month. I called them to install mine because the deal was nice. The first day, the internet was wonderful. Perfect! The next day, I tried to connect, but I couldn't. So, I called the number, 1-800-266-2278, and they taught me to install it again. However, the connection is very slow, much different from the first day and much different from the high speed internet I used to have before. The connection being perfect when they came to install it, no connection the next day, and a really bad connection after they helped me to install it leads me to think they tricked me into a deal that they are not willing to honor.I called them and complained about the slow connection. They sent someone here and told my daughter that this is what itŠ—Ès supposed to be and that the signal is perfect. Again, I had high speed for years and what they installed here does not agree with the first day installation, neither does it agree with the high speed internet I am aware of. I really believe that they installed a slower version, the one they should switch after six months when their advertised promotion expired. I feel cheated by Comcast, and it is the second time I called them without answers. They keep telling me to turn off the computer and the modem when I know the problem is with the connection. I wish I knew a number to tell on them so that Comcast gets some close investigation. If they did it to me, they are doing to other people for sure."
"M of Culpeper, VA","Jan. 5, 2009",0,"Billing... detailed billing... What are all these service fees, one time surcharges, high speed service charge? Why have a PACKAGE DEAL to save yourself all the extra FEES? Meanwhile, my internet goes out, my cable blacks out while watching a movie. I called Comcast and spoke to someone halfway across the country. The local office is 4.5 miles from me. I'm given a reason for the black-out or frozen channels or no internet - WE ARE WORKING TO UPGRADE SERVICE IN YOUR AREA.Hello? This service isn't available to me and won't be for years. I'm paying my bills, getting crappy service and being shut down while others are being upgraded? Come on, all customers should have credited to their accounts all of the shutdown, black-out or frozen channel errors (made while these upgrades are being done). It is appalling how many times this has and is going to happen... and then... why are you paying $31+ a month already for high speed service. And now, Comcast is offering it to you for $31+ for 3 months and then will whack you after that for $52+ per month? We are already paying high speed service fee. Check your DETAILED BILL."

"David of 4049 Acorn Dr, TN","Dec. 16, 2008",0,"This complaint has been resolved, but you should post where others can see it! I also had a problem 2 years ago. I wanted to add their internet service so I went online and looked it up, their website said 19.99 for the first 3 months, so being as smart as I am I took a screenshot and saved it on the computer(for windows just hit the print screen button open a word doc and select edit paste or ctrl v). So I got my first bill and the internet service was 39.99 I called, was passed around for about an hour, got frustrated and hung up, called back the next day and the same thing happened, well I did this for a week, got so mad, I decided to contact the BBB. Within a week a representative called me from comcast, told me that he was going to refund the total amount I paid for the internet over the 3 month period which was like 120$, I said thank you now go ahead and cancel my services, he had the nerve to ask me if I had  contacted them (comcast), to see if they could match the price, I lost it. I politely told the man that I would never do business with comcast again.  With that said my girlfriend just moved into a house and decided to get comcast, after I specifically told her not to, and guess what they told her it would be 19.99 for the first 4 months over the phone (not lucky enough to get a screenshot!), so now I have to go through the process again considering they are charging her 61$ for high speed internet. if you are having a problem with them log on to the Better Business Bureau website and file a complaint, they are paid to investigate, and companies like comcast will reimburse you the money because they do not want negative claims filed with the BBB."

If somebody emails you with images attached and you try to send a reply, it is impossible to un-attach the images from the original email on your reply. Its time to take them to court, and to switch over to Verizon. After paying $50 per month for over four years the emails I've gathered have all been lost. These included gallery communications which I cannot refer to, and dealings with clients whom I have freelanced for. I cannot begin to calculate the negative consequences this will have on my career."
"Stephen of Palm Beach, FL","Dec. 10, 2008",0,"When I attempted to add Digital Voice and High Speed Internet as a package with my current COMCAST basic cable TV service, I discovered their predatory and clearly deceptive policy as to whether a new customer can use their own modem. While the sales rep. had indicated I would be required to rent a modem ($5/mo. + $50 security deposit)I learned shortly thereafter that a costomer-owned modem  could be allowed. I bought one from a local computer tech. who made sure I was getting one with both the internet and phone ports. Upon arrival for hook-up of my service, the Comcast installer noted immediately that he wouldn't be able use my modem rather than renting one to me. He actually had an identical modem (used) with him as a rental but explained that the only customer-owned modem Comcast would allow would be one which wouldn't actually work in my case (no phone port). He explained that Comcast only allows modems with serial #'s (not model #'s) which they have registered within a specific service district. He was reluctant to offer this explanation but did so as he felt sorry for me after the two calls to his supervisors, at my request, werefully unhelpful. I refused to agree to the modem security deposit and rental as I had a modem which the installer indicated would work fine if allowed by Comcast. After cancelling the installation I called the West Palm Beach Comcast office and asked to speak with a Customer Service Supervisor. I was transferred to a Sales supervisor who would answer my questions with only one sentence: That's our policy. My complaint to the Comcast Executive Comlaint Center, by e-mail, resulted in a brief form e-mail saying someone would contact me for complaint details. There's been no response. What a fiasco!        Because of Comcast's misleading and deceptive modem rental policy, I have been unable to use the modem which I purchased (to avoid the rental). When I cancelled the installation, Comcast had already transferred my phone service to them and I had to spend extensive time with AT&T to get them back as a carrier and to avoid losing my phone number as AT& T indicated Comcast now owned that number."
"Duane of Seattle, WA","Dec. 5, 2008",0,Comcast has been unable to correct a computer issue for months. My online bill pay account access was blocked by them(a fact they refused to accept. I then followed their web page instructions on how to restore it. In doing so I made an error and quickly notified them that I did. I was told it would take 24 hours to fix and it wasn't a major problem. Lie number 1. 72 hours later I still could not get into my account. When I contacted them again they stated it now take 48 hours and be no problem. Which meant they hadn't done anything the first time . Lie number 2. Now the time went from 24 to 48 hours . Lie number 3. Each time I was shuffled around from call center to call center to eventually the chat help. Which is really no help. 72 hours later the problem still was not cured.  I work from online. This time nothing was done. Another lie # 4. Again the phone shuffle. Again the  passing of the buck to the chat line. This time I refused that.Luckily I found an agent willing to talk to me and work with me or so I thought. He acted me and talked to the chat line people. He too was ready to   explode from the incident. He made promises to follow up and call me and have others call me.... more lies. In truth Comcast hadn't worked on it in every incident. I finally had to send letters threatening to sue before things happened. Then to top it all off when they did the work they it twice requiring me to go back and refill the forms twice to get my account activated.  Then today I go to use my computer and my services had been cut off. I then had to waste another morning trying to get some answers. I was told I could not talk to a supervisor when I had talked to one during previous headaches. More lies. The constant lies has left me wondering what can I trust from these people? I'm still waiting to hear back from a supervisor. Not having access to make payments was costing me a fortune. Lost time was losing me a fortune. It  may have lost me a few clients. Not having the ability to meet my schedules due to Comcast's inability to meet customers needs is an atrocity.

About 15 minutes later, I tried to change the password back to MY password and forgot what they set it to, so I called back.

I have NO OPTIONS BUT TO WAIT FIVE MORE DAYS - a total of EIGHT days with no email.  I asked to speak to his boss Tony who was nasty and would not budge on resetting my password.  APPARENTLY they keep NO NOTES on what THEY just changed my password to and would not override their default of 11 times to change it.I have an online store and cannot be notified of sales.

"Yvonne of League City, TX","Nov. 30, 2008",0,"I contacted comcast back on sept 25,2008, in regards to payments not being credited to my account over 720.00 worth.  First they said 36 hours, then it became 72 hours.  Then they asked for faxes regarding bank statements, showing the payments, I have faxed/emailed/called everyday trying to get this resolved.  You can never reach the a/r dept, they have to be emailed and then they'll return your phone call. During this whole process they have shut down my account every other week, thus burning up their cable box and router.  We sent in payments to help them figure out where the payments went.  To this day November 29,2008 still not resolution, no call back and no credits.  Amazing we did everything we were asked faxing emailing over 50 times the info that they requested, still nothing.  I have let all my co-workers/friends/relatives know never to do business with comcast again.  They are now switching to a company that has a customer service.  I hope this helps many other possible future customers know that this is not the company for service. There are too many other companies out there to provide these services.Loss of work due to no internet services"
"Bill of Cape Coral, FL","Nov. 29, 2008",0,"My Comcast Internet went out about 9 days ago and after 10 or more attempts, they still have not fixed the problem.  Their call center just keeps telling me lies that the Line Tech will come out to fix it, but he never shows up.  Every time I call they act as thought it is the first time reporting the problem.  When I ask for a supervisor they just put me on hold.  They have hung up on me twice.  Comcast needs to be dismantled because it is a developing monopoly that is causing a disservice to the consumer.

"Beth of Olathe, KS","Nov. 21, 2008",0,"I am complaining about the new SmartZone as well as general internet service. Believe me, there is nothing smart about SmartZone--every action can take minutes to perform, so reading and replying to email is at a snail's pace. Sometimes it just won't respond at all, like to reply all. This has been going on for over 3 weeks. At about the same time, our internet in general slowed down also. Pages take forever to open, so surfing the web is not an option. When I contacted them via email they acknowledged problems with SmartZone. When I finally couldn't take it anymore and called them today, I would get disconnected after routing thru their system--this happened 4 times before I finally hit the right digit that didn't just say thank you, goodbye. The person I finally got to also tried to tell me email was a free service, so they would not give any refunds for that. As far as I'm concerned email and internet go hand in hand. I'm running my email thru comcast.net, which is the internet.  We've also had TV signal problems, not able to get a bunch of channels and others freezing up all the time--one guy came out and couldn't figure anything out--finally said we needed a booster--which we have to pay for of course. I declined, and lo and behold, a couple weeks later the channels miraculously started coming in again. Everest is putting cable in in our area right now, and I will be switching as soon as I can. Frustration, not being able to get the shopping, contacts etc that I needed, high blood pressure! Thank goodness this is not a work situation."

"Kerwin of Chicago, IL","Nov. 14, 2008",0,"For extended periods of time  over  several years, I have experienced  excessive modem disconnections, excessively slow speeds, pixelated  video on my television service, and gross incompetence and lack of concern on the part of the Comcast  service department to resolve the issues. Rest assured that one area of the company's infrastructure seems to work very well; it's billing!The representative simply regurgitates the scripted mantra,  stay home and  an installer will be out to look at the problem. For at least 4 years I have been enduring this lackadaisical, non-theoretical  approach to problem resolution, to no avail. If one wonders why I haven't switched to another broadband provider, the answer is quite simple; My profession as a Systems Engineer requires me to have broadband connectivity and Comcast is the only broadband service provider in the Chicago area. My business suffers along with my ability to perform my work functions. I literally have to go to the local library to work. I have a web presence and and email alias which is non-reachable and not reliably publishable. I have lost customer confidence and  customers as a result of not being able to establish viable communications links with tier one customers."
"Renate of Hopewell, VA","Nov. 12, 2008",0,"As soon as I can I'm getting rid of Comcast. I'm so tired of the run around and being passed from one billing associate to another. On Oct 15 I called to have my high speed internet downgraded. I just lost my job and I need to cut back. As soon as I got off the phone I went to my computer to refresh the page and got a limited or no connection error. I called back and the tech tried to renew my IP address online. No luck. They sent out a tech who spent several hours trying and left saying it was my ethernet card and I needed to replace it. I told him the computer was working fine until I downgraded. He said these things happen. He said he wasn't going to charge me for the service call because he wasn't sure if that really was the problem.I replaced the ethernet card, still no connection, so I took my computer to a computer repair shop. There was no problem with my computer there. So I brought it home and hooked it back up, still no connection. Another Comcast tech came out and a couple hours later told me it was my computer. Someone had told me once that McAfee, that is provided by Comcast had blocked their IP address. So I uninstalled it. Viola' I had internet. After all that and 2 weeks with no computer. I called the tech back and he sid to call Comcast and tell them what happened. They said they would deduct 2 weeks from my bill. I just got my bill. $164.00. They billed me for the high speed performance that I downgraded from, charged me for the service call that the first guy said I wouldn't be charged for, charged me for a service call the billing associate couldn't explain. Okay I got all that taken care of and I've yet to see the 2 weeks deducted from my bill. I was passed around from one billing associate to another and finally I called again the next day after my bill was reduced to $91.16. The automated voice message said it was $115. I called and he said he would disreguard that bill. Told me to add up the $54.00 cable and $24.95 internet, $3.00 modem rental and with the taxes it's suppose to total $91.16?? What are we suppose to do when you can't get them to correct your bills?"

"T.winston of North Fort Myers, FL","Oct. 29, 2008",0,"I am a Comcast customer in North Fort Myers Florida. I have cable tv and internet access. I've been reading where Comcast has been accused of throttling down broadband to limit download speeds and control how much you can download. I believe their comment was that they aren't doing this anymore. Well, let me tell you, they are here in SW Florida. We are supposed to have speeds here of over 5mb/s. I download PDF's from local county and city governments for construction projects in the area. (I'm a retired construction PM). I do this to keep my neighbors and family informed on projects that may impact them. I just this minute tried to down load a PDF file that was 5.2MB in size. Down load time was estimated at 11 minute and it took all of that. THAT IS THROTTLING!  This is not right. I don't do all that much. I pay for a certain speed and I ought to get what I pay for.

"Dawn of Michigan City, IN","Oct. 20, 2008",0,"I started working as a remote agent for a company, but in order to do my job proficiently, the software required a cable or dsl consistent internet speed of 4.0 or higher. However, I am only receiving a speed within the 1-3 speed even though I am paying for 6.0. When I called the rep..went through and had me delete this and that and disable stuff like the firewall and virus software etc. Okay, I know how to do this stuff and had already been doing most of this every time prior to connecting to the work program. I however do not feel that I should have to disable my antivirus and firewall (something that protects my personal information and my computer from hackers, and virus) in order to receive a higher speed I am already paying for, which didn't even fix the problem. Are they going to buy me a new computer when I have to disable my protection services in order to get online in the first place..I think not! Are they going to pay the bills or repair any damage that may be caused because someone was able to hack into my computer and steal my personal information..I think not!When they finally scheduled a tech to come out..he could of course find nothing wrong..I was told that due to the powerboost they no longer guarantee a speed of 6.0 or 8.0 etc. That with the powerboost, if someone in the area downloads a file, such as music, an application, game, or is even playing a high speed internet game of any large amount in size, it kicks in the powerboost for them and takes any available bandwidth there is, which therefore lowers your connection speed.Okay, I don't care about the powerboost, quite frankly it does not benefit me the least. I hardly download or upload music, pictures, games etc. So I was happy with the consistent guaranteed speed in which I was paying for in the first place. So, how is this powerboost fair for most general consumers? I'm sure I am not the only one out here who feels the same. Powerboost is geared mostly for those who play games etc. not the everyday person who uses the internet for work and everyday basic home functions. They need to somehow separate the two, and give those that want the guaranteed speed in which they are paying for, and are happy to be without the powerboost, their speed back, and those that want the powerboost, then let them fight with each other over the bandwidth and speeds all in their own little group.Anyway the tech, was really nice and changed out all the cables etc. with new ones..and ran all kinds of tests and said that my speeds are right where they should be, and with the powerboost, it is within excellent range.So, that tells me that they have capped my speed at 3.0, and then when someone else kicks in their powerboost or there is a lot of high traffic, it then kicks me down more to an even lower speed."
"Matt of Houston, TX","Oct. 17, 2008",0,"Re: 1) Illegal Slamming of my internet account by switching from EarthLink to Comcast without notification or approval. 2) Arbitrarily changing monthly internet service charges for each of the last 5 months without my knowledge or consent. I subscribed to EarthLink to provide internet services since 2006 or perhaps before. EarthLink internet services were provided by the local Houston cable franchise, TCI cable which was purchased by Comcast. Earlier this year I was switched from being an EarthLink customer to a Comcast customer without my knowledge or consent. As the monthly bill has always come from the actual service provider, TCI and then Comcast after the buyout, there was no way for me to know this change had occurred as it was normal to receive a bill from Comcast as Comcast is the physical provider for the EarthLink service.It was only in April that I learned I was a Comcast customer when my mail server was not working and both EarthLink and Comcast told me I was not their customer, even though I was on automatic payment and had always paid my bill on time. Eventually Comcast told me I was now their customer even though I did not want this switch. I was told I had no choice in the matter.After being told I had been switched to a Comcast customer, against my will, the next 2 monthly billing statements (ending 6/4/08 and 7/4/08) were the same monthly fee of $41.95/month plus $1.40 for taxes, surcharges and fees as they had been prior to the unauthorized switch of provider. The next bill dated 7/5/08 for the period of 7/5/08-8/4/08 increased the monthly service charge by 52% to $63.81, added $1.99 for a one-time change of service and increased taxes and fees to $3.50. There was absolutely no notice of the change, no conversation, no approval, nothing - simply a dramatically increased bill.On 7/17/08 I called Comcast and spoke with Beverly about the situation. She told me when I swapped modems (due to extremely inconsistent service) on 6/24/08 Comcast changed my plan. I was never told of any changes when I swapped the modem and had no reason to believe anything would be any different as I had swapped modems several times before at the exact same TCI/Comcast location when EarthLink was my provider. I told Beverly about my normal rate of $41.95 per month and that was the only acceptable plan I would agree to. She told me they would make adjustment for the bill of 7/5/-8/4/08 in the next billing cycle and that my monthly rate going forward would be $41.95 - exactly as it had been for years.When I received the next bill (for 8/5-9/4/08) there was an adjustment that was quite confusing as the unpaid balance still showed as $26.28, but the bill showed a low monthly charge and a one-time credit that put the total somewhere in the ballpark of reason. The weird monthly charge, credit, and remaining previous balance on the bill made absolutely no sense to me, but again the total was somewhere where it should be.On 9/30/08 I spoke with Comcast to request credit for the 17 days of no service due to the hurricane and no electricity. I had not opened the bill dated 9/5/08 until AFTER the bill dated 10/5/08 as my mail had stacked up to several feet before and especially during the period after the hurricane where I had no electricity for 17 days. (I did open some mail during that time, but bills that are on automatic payment, such as the Comcast bill, are not a priority for me to review since I know they are automatically paid each month.) I opened the bill dated 10/5/08 on 10/11/08 and noticed the monthly charge of $48.30 and was upset as it was supposed to be $41.95 as per my telephone conversation and agreement with Comcast made on 7/17/08. Some credit was on the 10/5/08 bill, however considering the monthly charges was $48 and 17 days is OVER Î_ of a month, I was not happy a credit of $18.68 had been applied as this was less than half of $41.95 let alone ComcastŠ—Ès new charge of $48.30. I was also not happy about the monthly charge being $48.30 as it was not $41.95 as had been agreed on 7/17/08.At that point I opened the bill dated 9/5/08 and saw yet another amount billed for monthly service: $32.99. In reviewing 5 consecutive months bill the Š—“Comcast High Speed InternetŠ— charge went from $41.95, to $63.81, to $17.70, to $32.99 and finally to $48.30. Apparently Comcast seems to pick and choose which base charges it wants to charge and from which ones it wants to deduct each and every month.When I called and spoke to Mario at Comcast on 10/13/08 I was told I had been switched on 7/17/08 to a three month plan rate of $29.99. At no time was there any discussion on 7/17/08 of switching the plan from anything than a straight $41.95/month each and every month. I told Mario of my discussion with Beverly and we had both agreed that the initial plan, which was the only plan to which I had EVER agreed, was what the bill should be. Mario put me on hold several times and stated his supervisor said there was nothing he could do as he told me Š—“I had accepted the changes since I hadn't complained earlierŠ—.I called again on 10/15/08 and spoke with Alana after reviewing the documents and noting that I had called on a timely basis as it was with 48 hours of when I discovered the problem. I told Alana I could not be expected to be a fortune teller to understand the changes in the bill as the total amount shown on the front of the bill for the Š—“Comcast High Speed InternetŠ— amount had changed SIGNIFICANTLY up and down each and every month for 5 consecutive months. When Alana became aware the only thing that would make me happy was to put me back at the $41.95 to which we had agreed on 7/17/08, she transferred me to the retention department. After being on hold, I was disconnected, but Alana did call back and eventually got Randal in the retention department. I spoke one sentence (IŠ—Èm tired of the crap from the billing department by getting billed different amounts 5 months in a row) and Randal hung up. I sincerely doubt the disconnect was accidental. I sent an email complaint on 10/16/08 which recommended calling a local 713 number, rather than the 800 number. I called and spoke to Denise, then to Claudia in retention and they refused to fix the problem only offering different promotional rates. I hope you consider: A) revoking ComcastŠ—Ès cable franchise; B) Assess civil penalties for the unlawful behavior of Comcast; and C) access criminal penalties for the unlawful behavior of Comcast as you have the authority to do so."

"Diane of Loganville, GA","Oct. 7, 2008",0,"For 6 years, I've worked from my home using Comcast Internet service to update and maintain several web sites for my home-based business. Then 3 weeks ago, updating the sites became almost impossible. I could connect easily (using Contribute), but saving a change (just correcting a misspelled word) took anywhere from 5 minutes to 35 minutes. The same thing happened on sites that were hosted on private servers and on a site hosted with Go Daddy and Earthlink.After much research (and talking to technical experts at the server company), the diagnosis was that Comcast was blocking my upload. When I contacted Comcast to report the problem, I was told by the rep that Comcast was monitoring people's usage and blocking usage for those they considered 'businesses'. I was 'urged' to sign up for their Business service (which is ONLY $40 more a month that what I pay now). They did agree to send out a service technician, who ran a new cable to replace the old one we had, but the problem still existed. He, too, told me what Comcast was doing about blocking service and urged me to call their business service department. My business literally has come to a stop. To do any website work, I go to a neighbor's house, use their computer and their Comcast service. Apparently, Comcast hasn't 'monitored' their usage as of yet.

I had called the support number every day to find out what was going on and they kept telling me they were working on it.Today, I called them and was told that maintenance for the repair was cancelled and they just put in their notes issue not fixed. I called the first technician and his supervisor to find out what happened and why. All I get is their voicemail immediately and still no answers to my polite messages that I have left for both of them. So now they have to call another technician so they can schedule another maintenance person to come out to fix the issue; if that ever happens. This Monopoly MUST stop! Where are you Verizon FIOS?!

"Bo of Miami, FL","Sept. 28, 2008",0,"I received email from COMCAST.

I quote '... because a fraction of one percent of our customers use such a disproportionate amount of bandwidth every month that they may degrade the online experience of other customers.? This is pure PR speak.  So, for the sake of  a fraction of one percent?, they are going to set limits on 99% of the consumers! I can't believe that the fraction of one percent that are using excessive bandwidth are affecting this company's bottom line and I know that these 1% ers are not capable of and do NOT degrade the online experience.?

"Anna of Southfield, MI","Aug. 12, 2008",0,"I have had nothing but nightmares since signing up with Comcast for high speed and phone service apprx 6 months ago.When I first signed up for service I only had cable and the lady I talked with said she would give me the triple play 33.00 each (cable, phone and high speed) however I never got charged for that, also I was told that my directory assistance calls would be free because I'm legally blind, they gave me a fax number to fax in the info... I NEVER received that up to present... I have been in the hospital off and on for 6 months due to health issues and since I could not see the bill I never knew how high the bill was.I just sent payment in by my son. When I orginally signed up for the service I asked that my phone numbers be non published it took 2 months to get that corrected the supvervisor kept calling saying it was fixed, however whenever I called from certain phones the operator kept giving out the number. Yes, it took 2 months to get that corrected. The supervisor said they would credit me for that, however I never received a credit. I canot afford to pay 200.00 a month for this service. My friends are leaving Comcast due to the poor quality service. Mr. Roberts no one should have to go through this, however if you don't pay your bill they amazingly cut if off fast. I should get credit for months of poor service. Someone should be able to pull my records and see the turmoil I've gone through. You call customer service they won't let  you speak to a supervisor. Also I think the MPSC and BBB should look into these matters. My friends are leaving Comcast due to the poor quality service.

"Abbie of Rineyville, KY",39656,0,"July 19th the high speed internet service went down in my area for more than 48 hours.  Since then it has been up and down, but more down than anything else.  I have internet phone, so if I leave to go somewhere and the phones go out and my children have an emergency..how will they let anyone know? They can't.  This keeps my husband from doing the online parts of his college classes, and is effecting his grade and the best they could give me was a $6.00 refund for no service.  I to had been told a technician would come to my house and no one ever showed up.  Oh yeah and the customer service advised me to get in my car and find a wi-fi hotspot if I wanted internet...which is funny because thats what I thought I WAS PAYING THEM FOR?  We have no other choice for internet service in the area either,  I wish the cable industry had NEVER been deregulated, because they have us bent over a barrel and since they are the only providers they have no reason to provide good customer service.Time lost in school and being able to reply to emails from my customers"

Only after I complained to the BBB could I even get an employee who knew how to handle the situation. I wanted 1 year of refund of the difference in price. They offered 3 months, which in my view is them admitting they made the mistake in the first place.I was charged $210.88 every month, but should have been charged their residential rates of $50 or so. This went on for years. I was willing to settle for 1 year's refund."
"Marni of Arlington, VA",39630,0,"I moved from Reston to Arlington and continued my service with Comcast for Internet, Cable and phone.  When it was installed in March 2008 it took the technician two days to get it installed.  After about a week it started freezing and not working properly.  We ignored it and finally called in April to get a technician to come out and fix it.  One came out and switched out the boxes 3 times because each box he tried to install did not work.  On the 3rd try he finally got them working however, a week later the box shut off completely.  I called to get them to come back out and fix it and they did not show up for the appointment.  They issued me a credit and rescheduled the appt.  Once again they did not show up.  This has been going on since May.  I keep scheduling appointments and they continue to not show up either because their car broke down, they said they called when they never did or they are unable to make it during the window given.  I have scheduled 8 appointments since May and still cannot get a technician to come out and fix the issue.  I was told by several customer service reps that they issued credits for every appt missed.  I just spoke to a supervisor who said she had no record of these credits.  I've also received a bill for 160 for service I have not been receiving.  My cable doesn't even turn on.  The technicians have been giving their reps false information about calling me prior to the visit when I never receive a phone call.  At this point I'm getting ready to cancel my service with them however, I cannot find another provider in my area so I have no other options now.  I've never spoken to an understanding representative and I've been told several times they are short on technicians.  This might be why they have not shown up to the last 8 scheduled appointments.  At this point, I feel justified in not paying the fees because I have no working service.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm being charged for service that I'm not getting and faulty equipment.  Also, I am extremely stressed out and frustrated because I'm not getting any where. I spend too many hours on the phone with Comcast trying to resolve this as well as too many hours waiting to find out if they will show up."
"Tejas of Shelby Township, MI",39630,0," I told Comacast to lower my Internet service to low speed from high speed to save money. They told me on phone that they did it. For next month I was billed less money. The month after that I was charged higer again. So, I called them to find out why. They told me that nobody ever reduced my service to lower speed and i did not check my bills properly. I did not remember what date I called them to reduce the charge. (if I dig my phone records,it will show though). So now because I don't remeber the date I told them to reduce service, I am made to pay higher prices  from that point onwards including last months difference!( they say that they put multiple product discount which I did not had, how in the world I know their billing terminology?)       6 months ago they were charging me for DVR services on cable when I never asked them for DVR. The technician who came to install said he had only DVR reciever not regular one. Was it my fault he did not had regular reciever.     They are the most unethical company in the world. Cheating and dishonesty is their motto.For cable services I was overcharged for multiple months extra money for DVR reciever. $11/month vs $5.95/month.    For internet services, I am charged for higher product of $57.95 vs low speed product of appx $39. (for 2 months)   In both cases, I got the products they charged me for. But I did not ordered them. I ordered lower products."

"William of Oak Park, IL",39621,0,"I am a network engineer by trade. In my locality Comcast is the predomonant carrier for cable television and broadband. On the television reception side of things the amount of compression they apply to video signals is really beginning to show up on almost all non-HD channels as blockiness. On HD channels, there are often interruptions in the audio portion.  Broadband is much worse. I see average ping times to my default route of 500ms, Domain Name Servers (DNS) that are unreachable, connection resets when trying to retrieve emails or download Windows updates. Throughput, on the rare occasion when things are working may approach 4 Mbps (which is what they advertise), but is typically hovering around a sputtering, intermittent 300 Kbps. In my opinion, this level of service does not constitute broadband.  Repeated calls yield little to no results other than the suggestion that I unplug my cable modem and reconnect it. When I get more insistent about problem solving, then they tell me that they will need to send a technician to my premises to check my connections. I ask them how this will help my Comcast afflicted neighbors who are all experiencing the same problems. At this point they tell me that I should talk to a higher level support technician, and after being on hold for ten minutes all I receive is a click and a dial tone. Repeating this process yields similar results. It is futile.Comcast is expensive at approximately $150.00 per month for a TV and internet package."
"Jerry of Humble, TX",39595,0,When calling Comcast local they tried to blame it on my browser.

I need to speak with them when I have some technical support as I know nothing in addition business is really rough and I cannot shut down during our brief season or tie myself up or my phone lines.  I am so frustrated and of course this is the cable company and I have no recourse. Patriot Media has been our provider for years and we never had a problem and the service was excellent. How do I get them to cooperate, this is my business I need help. They have already shut down my VPN for half a day for them to update, during business hours, this little switch will cost $ 350.00 plus downtime for my business, there is no telling how much business I will lose due to their changeover."
"Spencer of Chicago, IL",39581,0,"I had a appointment set for 8-12 on 5/12/08 and never had any body arrive, I called to ask why no one was here and they said that the technician was outside after looking outside I told the rep that their was no one outside, she indicated that they were going to get a part and would be here at my house within 20 minutes, I stood outside and waited with nothing, I even had lawn people in the yard for these hours and they even were looking out for the technician.   I called back and spoke to Latoya and she told me she was the manager and she fixed the mistake and was sending someone out to do the job today 5/13, well needless to say 4:30PM came around and I started calling they told me that the appointment was set for 5/14 1-4PM, now I have taken 1 entire day off work to get my service corrected and now your Scheduling Dept, took it into their own to reschedule me with out my knowledge, heck I have had all the neighbors on the look out, but Nothing.   Now they expect me to take another day off for their error. I am writing a letter to the BBB the state and the local media to address these horrible consumer relations department, I am also contacting the investors on this site to share the horrible experience I have had again with your company, if you look at the original order a year ago this same crap happened and I was credited for the months it took to get service, this is a clear indication that your company is not doing the right thing as far as service and knowledge of the procedures at hand and not even making the money I as a consumer am willing to pay for true service.   Yet another horrible experience with Comcast and to think I pay you guys monthly for this type of service, I feel that maybe I should take your equipment outside and slam it on the porch and order from a company who cares about their consumers.   I pay you guys 130 a month and the internet connection is bad so this is your error not mine, but I am the one paying for this by having to deal with your horrible Service representatives at the Woodridge Il. location.   I spoke to Latoya who clearly lied about the reschedule only to get me off the phone and to a manager by the name of Arlo & Andrew, Andrew just kept putting back in queue and telling me that it was my fault! This guy needs to be fired based on the fact that he kept hanging up on me! And to think that you guys can go in and put notes in place to make it look as if you have done your part when all these validations are bogus!   I then called yet again in hopes of getting a different competent supervisor and I spoke to Markus and he was the only one that tried to help correct the mistake and he clearly stated that the technician missed the appointment and told me he would follow up tomorrow, so now I am taking another day of work and I feel backed into the corner.   I hate the service at COMCAST and I will take the time to share this poor service outcome to all that may make a difference, this is clearly a waste of everybodys time!  I am writing you in hopes that this information can be taken to the top and addressed,Lost a full days work and now the want me here again tomorrow!"

"Gerald of Grand Rapids, MI",39579,0,"First off both my wife and myself run our businesses' from our home. We have an at home office with faxes and 4 computers.  We need internet and of course phone service.  We have Comcast Cable, Internet, phones & television.  We have trouble with all of it and cannot get anything resolved with Comcast at all.    I am CONSTANTLY being kicked off line right in the middle of something.  Or, kicked off during the middle of a phone call, if that is, I can actually get the phone call in, or out, in the first place!?   while on the phone, many times, I can hear the person on the other end however, they cannot hear me or visa versa.    Sometimes, we just simply get disconnected.  Boom!  Phone call ended.  Internet gone.  Sometimes, we can reconnect or redial, other times not.  Sometimes it's only for a few seconds, other times, for several minutes,  other times, the internet is a problem for an entire day.    I am told by Comcast, that the problem is NOT in my home. The problem is a Comcast problem.  So, that eliminates the need for anyone to have to enter my home yet, each time, they come over, check the same crap IN MY HOME, tell me the same thing and go away with nothing changed.  These problems with Comcast is a DAILY occurrence and usually it happens many times throughout the day!!!   This has been an ongoing issue with Comcast for well over a year!!  It has not gotten better and in fact, during the past few months has gotten considerably worse instead!    No matter what I do and no matter what they do or promise me, the problem has never even once been resolved.    They claim that a supervisor will be out to look at the problem and it will be fixed tomorrow.  I have as YET to have even seen ONE supervisor let alone, talk to one.    They send the same people come out that can do nothing but tell me the same thing.  You have to much power coming into your home and/or, not enough power going out.  The problem is NOT in your home, it is between the telephone lines and Comcast.  We will have it fixed immediately.  Yet, nothing is ever resolved.  It is so damn frustrating and time consuming it's pitiful!!  I am losing my ability to contact my clients and their ability to contact me. I am receiving complaints from them as well but, there isn't a thing I can do to prevent it.  I am positive that not all phone calls are reaching my home office.  No calls = no business...    We try sending faxes, get disconnected half way through.  I can't count the amount of time I've spent redoing an email because I got kicked off line or the amount of time I've wasted talking to these idiots from Comcast on the phone.  All, no to avail."

They set up a service visit (unneccessary) for Good Friday.  Of course they never showed and when I called they said the appointment had never been made.  I explained my problem and, again, set up an appointment.  A rep came out and said yes, I needed to have the cable buried and that Miss Utility would show up soon.  It's now May 7, going on 5 months with the cable going diagonally across my yard making it difficult to mow.

I am very upset by Comcast reaction and most of all why are you charging me?  Your record show that my services was never connect so why am I being billed.  Businesses should not charged people for services that was never received. I don't understand. Please review my account.

In Early February, I called to cancel my internet account effective FEBRUARY 22, 2008.   Then I got a bill and called, because I had called to cancel, but was being charged.  I moved out of the house on February 22, 2008.  I expained this to the person with whom I spoke.  She told me don't worry.   She said they had recorded the disconnect with the February 22 effective date, but had not yet sent someone to the physical address yet to disconnect the service.  However, my Incorrect billing would be fixed as soon as THEIR TECHNICIANS went to do thier job!  I thought the issue had been resolved.  Appearently not.  Because  TODAY I got a NASTY & AGGRESSIVE voice mail message demanding I call to arrange to disconnect my service as new owners wanted to set-up their internet.  I HAD CANCELLED ALREADY!!  I called a SECOND TIME was told A SECOND TIME it would be addressed.  Instead I got hostility and still am being charged for services cancelled in a home I no longer own!  My decision now is not to use Comcast for either cable or internet here in Seattle.  Hopefully they won't screw with my credit.  However, as I have a bill with a past due (again for services twice cancelled in a home I no longer own) I don't put anything past them! I expect I will bet a hit on my credit report for not paying for service in a home I don't own.  Mostly, the consequence to date is frustration and hours of stress."
"Uday of Plainsboro, NJ",39540,0,"I am a new customer and took cable TV services from Comcast in mid Jan 2008. Meanwhile I took Internet services through Comcast offers ($19.95/month) in the month of Feb 2008.   Problems: 1. I am still being charged for $42.95/month for internet. I was asked to submit the mail-in-rebate forms for the $19.95/m offer to start. In-spite of sending the mail-in-rebate to Comcast, I am being charged $42.95.   2. During the month of March, Comcast was upgrading the cables in my area and I was without internet service for 3 weeks in a row after the upgrade was completed. In-spite of regular follow-ups, no one was able to fix the problem. Only after escalating the issue, the issue was addressed. During these 3 weeks I have lost lot of time, peace of mind and money.  3. I was told that I'll not be charged for the duration I did not have the services, but I have the bill in my hand now and I do not see any discounts.  4. Whenever I call 1-800-comcast either the call is disconnected or they try to misguide me. had to disturb my friends during night because I had to send some emails. I use Vonage and I was without phone for 3 weeks. It was a huge risk as I did not have anyway to reach my pregnant wife at home.

"Gina of Knoxville, TN",39534,0,"My internet service went out so we called Comcast. They were not able to get it back up from their office and sent a service tech.

I was not told before the tech was sent out that there would be a charge if the modem was replaced nor did the tech tell me. I was told this is standard and they charge a fee if the modem is replaced.  To avoid paying the service call fee you either have to take the modem to Comcast or pay a monthly $3.00 protection plan fee.

"Joni of Milwaukie, OR","Feb. 25, 2008",0,"My son had his own apartment. For a birthday present I set him up with Comcast internet so he could do his college studies. My son has since joined the military and is in boot camp. I paid the bill off, but there was a credit due. The bills have gone to us the whole time, rather than to my son. Comcast is sending the credit amount to my son's address in his name. After speaking to two employees, one who said no problem, another who said it has to got go to my son (after waiting two weeks with no check.) Finally after 16 minutes on hold, a supervisor comes on the phone and says he'll see what he can do. Finally he comes back to say he can get the check to our house, but it has to be in my son's name. I asked why since my son has never paid the bill. They said he was set up as the account holder. Well of course he was, but WE paid the bill. It is OUR money to be refunded. IF my son was not at boot camp and going to be GONE for the next 6 YEARS, this would not be much of an issue. But he will not be around to sign the check that should not be issued to him in the first place. If I had been late on the payments the bill final bill would have been corrected. Of course they would have charged a late fee. Hmmm.The credit due back to us will not come to us. I don't know who gets to keep the money because my son doesn't live there anymore, but we who paid for it will not get the money without waiting for a mailing address, waiting for the check he was not supposed to get, to be signed and mailed back. By then it will be 4 months out. How many company checks are still valid after 3 months? Not many.

Rachael (sales rep for Comcast) denying there is no such thing. Rachael  said sign up for a program called Rhapsody but at my cost and I could get all the songs I wanted. She said the tech was misinformed. I asked to talk to her supervisor and she refused saying they would call me back. She transferred me to another department and they gave me an address to send a letter if I didn't like it. After a number of requests to talk with someone higher up the chain of command and being refused, Rachael claimed they were not responsible for what the tech told us and laughed. I hung up. They lied to me. The tech, who represents Comcast, told me I would get ten free song downloads for signing up with Comcast but now that we have paid for the service and signed up everyone passed the buck and no one will take responsibility for what the tech told me.

I was really mad and when I called comcast and told them of my problem, they said they don't do computers and can't help me. I since reformated and will never let one of their guys near my computer.

"Leslie of Lowell, MI","Jan. 7, 2008",0,"Lowell Cable TV sold to Comcast. This was supposed to be a great deal for the Lowell customers. It has been nothing but a nightmare. They state they are upgrading and need to do a modem swap for our high speed internet. Three appointments were made by THEM and then cancelled by THEM. For one of these appointments, I had someone come to my house. They had no idea the appointment was cancelled, so they waited for nothing. Finally the swap occurred - but that's all it was. WE had to hook up the new modem! Now I get a bill that's so cockeyed, it looks like they are re-billing me for December, which I already paid! I have been trying for 1 1/2 weeks to get to their customer service, to no avail. Each time I end up on hold anywhere from 30-45 minutes. Tonight, I waited over 2 hours and still never got a rep on the line. Tonight I sent 2 e-mails and demanded a call - we'll see what happens. I'm beginning to think that when a call comes in, it just gets put into a holding pool that nobody ever answers. I call at all different times of the day and night, hoping I will get through, but to no avail.I have a life and cannot spend it all on hold with Comcast. Their internet chat is no help - 3 different times I was told they could not access my account and were transferring the chat to somebody else. Nobody ever came back. I am frustrated but have nobody to talk to about it since they don't answer calls. I have a bill that I feel is wrong but is due soon, and I am afraid I will not get this straightened out ever. I cannot spend my day at work on hold with Comcast nor can I spend my time at home on hold with Comcast."
"Scott of Plantation, FL","Jan. 7, 2008",0,"After one month and endless hours of frustration with comcast, our service was finally connected and and working. Due to the long delay in getting our service up, comcast forgave the first months bill for over $170. Within the week however, comcast cut our service for not paying the bill. During this time I have asked to speak with a supervisor no less than 8 times. Always, I am told that one is available but that one would call me back within 24 hours. To date, not one supervisor has called me back to discuss our issues. The day we were disconnected, the line was dropped three times and twice by the same technician. I am finally going to give up and switch to the dish. We were the last holdouts on our street to do so, and now I know why. Hours and Hours of time, phone bills, waiting for technicians that don't show, disconnected service, disconnected access to our business e-mail... etc..."
"Keith of Oak Park, IL","Jan. 4, 2008",0,"I started my Comcast service in May 2007, within two weeks of my service I was already calling Comcast regarding poor internet connection and service drops. Initially I was told that my network was most likely incorrectly connected and that I should have a professional set up my network. After having this service completed I was still having issues. I continued to call Comcast a total of 33 times in 2 months to rectify this issue. On 3 separate occasions I was told that a service tech would be at my home between the hours of 8am and 2pm on each time the tech never came, never called and 4 hours of my life was wasted each time. A total of 12 hours that I will never get back....added to the countless minutes I have spent on the phone easily equals a week of my life that is gone and wasted. At this time I am paying for Comcast's 6mbs service however every speed test I have ever had done shows my download times a 386kbs which is not even remotely close to what I am paying. In fact, it is only 6.5% of what I am paying for. Also, I have been told on numerous occasions that I cannot cancel my account, even if I was looking to receive service from another provider... (for cable internet there is no one else in my area). Comcast has wasted my time, money and patience.  "
"Linda of Jersey City, NJ","Jan. 1, 2008",0,"My high speed Internet is a joke. Often I cannot open my webpage or if I click a prompt to go to another website (e.g., such as an article on the New York Times website) my computer freezes and I have to shut down the Internet and start again. For several days now, I have not been able to open my email. I called Comcast again this week and I got help but then it happened again. I have to try several times to check my email. Now tonight I cannot get into my email again. The Comcast page will not open after about 5 attempts. I got fed up went into google to see if there is a place to make a complaint. Then I saw a list of letters from other consumers who are fed up with Comcast. I pay a high monthly rate to have ths service and it frequently does not work properperly, often setting me behind in the work I had planned to do that particular day. Comcast has a monopoly on Internet service in my area. They run my cable, my phones, and of course Internet access to email. Something needs to be done about this service. I cannot not always complete research or answer email in a timely manner that is related to my work. I feel I am paying way too much money for a lousy service."
"Robert of Redwood City, CA","Dec. 22, 2007",0,"I was one of the first Comcast high speed Internet customers several years ago and was charged $95.99/month for 6Mb/sec download.  Recently I spoke to a Comcast Customer Service Rep and was told I was still paying for high speed, but that they had increased the speed to 9 Mb/sec months ago, but never increased my speed.  They never reduced my bill back to $33.99/mo as they should have.    I estimate I was overcharged $62/mo for 2-4 years.  They have now reduced my bill to $33.99/mo, but offered no credit.  This is an estimated overcharge of between $1,500 and $3,000.  How many thousands of customers have the same scenario?  This should result in a class action suit against Comcast in the millions possibly billions of dollars, and I request the Consumer Affairs advocacy group take this matter and follow up on my behalf as Comcast refuses to listen or credit me, although they acknowledge the error.  I need assistance with determining exactly when high speed was increased from 6mb/sec to 9mb/sec to calculate the exact damages. This is an estimated overcharge of between $1,500 and $3,000.

I pinned down customer support on this, and they agreed that they had received a check.  However, they had applied the payment to my ex-wife's account that had been closed for 4 months.

Morning rolls arround and everythings is a-ok.Something not symtematic of end user problems. If it's not node saturation, what is i?. And custumer service? Where is it?

I was told by Mr. Weeks that the total charges I would pay per month including any fees and taxes would be $72.79 for internet and phone service as I pay the basic cable through my builing here at Sun North, Peppertree Manor.  I was very cautious in making sure of the total amount I would need to pay per month to insure I could meet the obligation and was assured this $72.79 would be the total including fees and taxes, nothing more would be added.  The phone service was not installed and I got a bill for both services, internet and phone in the amount of $179.32. I called Comcast and Vanessa corrected the bill and assureed me my total bill I would need to pay the following month would be $72.79.  I get my new bill and it is for $80.40.  I have talked with a variety of people and the last one, David, Accounting Supervisor tells me I have been misinformed and there is nothing he can do so in other words it is my problem and at my expense, however I have not misinformed anyone about anything so I do not understand why I must pay a price for their mistake.  Isn't something wrong here?

Rep 2 said that the new price is what it was and that I had no choice.  Rep 3 only tried to sell me services I didn't want, need or ask for.

"Russell of Schaumburg, IL","Oct. 11, 2007",0,"Basically they charge for a service  which they can't provide. They have too many customers and this slows down the internet service in my area to speeds slower than dial up.This is worst from the time periods of 7PM to 12AM when internet usage is heavy. Six months ago I called for three months explaining what I was experiencing and what the problem was. I must have seen twenty technicians, told them the same story, not for three months did I finally get a call from a local manager asking me to please stop calling technicians, they were going to fix the problem. The problem was rectified when they split the node, the explanation I was given was that there was too many people on the node, something I had been saying for three months.I was credited for the internet time, but not the hours lost on the phone and time spent with technicians, which was well above ridiculous levels.Now, four months later, my service is awful again, for the same reasons, internet is too slow because too many people are on it. I called and am about to get the run around again.I'm fed up and I called and told a supervisor that if I wasn't treated right I will take legal action."

Apparently, they gave it to me temporarily to shut me up but decided it was time to start charging me without my being aware.

I allowed my daughter to use one of my mailboxes so that she could receive job alerts or email responses for applications for employment. Again, all spams but no job alerts. I contacted the so-called tech support and I got the run around several times. The excuse I got from Comcast is that there are filters that is preventing the emails. My question is this, why would a ** filter prevent emails from Monster.com? I asked this question and I was told that even though that there is a filter for Viagra, this filter can delete all emails. So I deleted the filters from my account and my daughter's account. Still no emails, but an occasional spam. Hmmm. I wonder what crook is lining the pockets of Comcast? I sent an email to the local Executive Assistant telling her that if this problem is not solved within 48 hours, I will cancel my account and sue Comcast. I also told the Executive Assistant that I will contact Qwest and order their DSL service. Fifteen minutes later my daughter receives almost 400 emails.

"Eleonor of West Orange, NJ","Jan. 25, 2006",0,Comcast increased their monthly price for internet access from $42 to $57.  that's a 36% increase in price!  And there is definitely no enhancement in the speed of internet access nor the quality of service.
"Don of West Chester, PA","Jan. 19, 2006",0,"I had Adelphia high-speed Internet in Southern CA for 5 years and never had a problem. I just moved to PA and Comcast is the only company with high-speed. Comcast is a terrible company to deal with for service problems! First, it took one month to get the service connected because of a Comcast records problem. Now, I have intermittent service (on 10 minutes and off for 5) and Comcast cannot find the problem. The tech told me today that there are 6 or 7 others in this neighborhood experiencing the same problem! The tech has been out 5 times now, and this Friday will be the sixth. The worst thing is that there is no way to escalate the problem within Comcast! Verizon cannot provide DSL where I live or I would switch in a minute. I am seriously considering going back to dial-up, except I have VoIP at a reasonable cost with AT&T and would hate to give that up. If you have good service with Comcast you are lucky. I have heard nothing but comments on how bad their service is here in PA. Competition is badly needed in this business. I really don't think that Comcast would survive with competition."
"Paul of Walker, LA","Nov. 18, 2004",0,"I scheduled a day off work to be home for the installation. Although my scheduled time was 3pm - 5pm, I was told that if the technican finished early on another job he may call to complete my job order prior to the scheduled time. While the technician was still at my home, I called Cox Communication to complain of the problem. They were also amazed at the fact the ceiling had a limitation for installation from the PRM Company. How many other future potential clients of Cox Communication are disatisfied with this type of service?"

"Chilly of Centralia, WA",38128,0,"For well over 3 years, my family and I enjoyed the benefits of having a home network system between just 2 computers, sitting side by side. File sharing across the network is one way we used our network. In our family, also, we enjoyed playing games with each other across the network. This, after all, seemed to be a safe way to allow our kids to enjoy the world of multiplayer gaming, but without the concerns of them interacting with strangers out on the web in gaming chat rooms.About 1 years ago, my wife enrolled in an online college program. She tried to manage with our mere telephone modem Internet access, but for all the obvious reasons (continuous disconnects, high internet traffic, etc.), it became necessary to get high-speed (HS) Internet access - something more reliable for her educational needs. With Comcast having recently dug up our street and installed the lines, and because they are the only TV cable company in our area, they seamed to be our only realistic option for HS Internet access.The Comcast installation technician was a gentleman, and was quite good, respectful, and new exactly what needed to be done. He installed one modem, then from that modem was attached our network hub. This gave both computers immediate Internet access. This was cool! After he left, and once our kids came home from school, we found, however, that we no longer could play games across the network. None of our file sharing or printer sharing capabilities existed anymore. We could go online and play multiplayer games just fine, individually, but not simultaneously. Though being a little PC hardware and software savvy ourselves, we still could not find a way to regain our home network capabilities.In frustration, and after a week of doing research, I learned something very disturbing - Comcast software, used for their HS Internet modems, automatically disables/sabotages home networks where they are installed; for another monthly fee, Comcast will come back (another day of work lost for me) and install their router that will enable my home network to work again, which, if you recall, worked just fine before they messed it up. Now remember, their technician installed one modem, connected our hub to it, and gave Internet access to both home PCs. No one said that our home network gaming and file sharing days were going to be over, UNLESS we paid them a monthly fee to fix something THEY disabled.OK, we may not be techno junkies, but were not entirely ignorant either. We went out to our local Radio Shack and bought a router. Problem solved. We got our network back, without loosing our Internet, and without being blackmailed into paying Comcast to fix something they  messed up. I really feel that Comcast was not forthcoming in explaining to this customer just how their HS Internet access was going to affect our existing home network. And, Comcast would not make right the problem that their hardware/software caused. Comcasts only solution was for them to come out, again, and install a router. And then, if that wasnt enough, they wanted to charge us $4.99/month/computer in our home that was on that network."
"Amie of Richmond, VA",38111,0,"Comcast has been a constant problem since it took over our cable, telephone and internet services over 1 year ago from AT&T.; There has been intermittent service eruptions, poor picture quality and billing for services that we do not use and have not ordered. One issue I have is that Comcast is trying to force us to order its family networking service because we have a laptop in addition to our work station. I am so tired of this."
"Bill of Burnsville, MN",38106,0,"The advice from technicians has been everything from removing ribbon cables, disabling ALL firewalls, virus scans, etc. (by the way I have a brand new computer with plenty of memory) to the suggestion that my new computer doesn't have enough memory!!!!

"Michael of Speedway, IN","Jan. 15, 2004",0,"I am an internet subscriber of Comcast. Recently their IP Network Abuse department has begun sending out AUP Violation letters, specifically targeting excessive bandwidth usage. Unfortunately, neither the letter, the AUP, the Comcast websites, nor any printed Comcast materials specify what those bandwidth usage limitations are. Essentially, what they are doing is drawing an invisible line, then threatening to disconnect anyone who crosses it. There is no way for a user to know what threshold was broken or how much they need to back off their usage to be within the limitations.I willingly describe myself as a high-end user. I download a lot of SHN and FLAC files, many of which can easily surpass 1GB. However, I am more than willing to curb my usage to meet any limitations set by Comcast ... if only they would actually make those limitations available to their subscribers. The letter provides a customer service number with the suggestion to upgrade to a business class account. First, the reps at the customer service center know absolutely nothing about the bandwidth usage limitations (they will offer to give you the number to the IP Network Abuse department ... more on that soon). Second, they will try to sell you the business class account without telling you that the bandwidth usage limitations don't vary from class to class. You would end up doubling your monthly bill with no added bandwidth. Now, as far as that number for the Abuse department that the customer service reps give out  ... it gives you only the opportunity to leave a message and have a rep call you back. That has yet to happen for me. Luckily, I came across a direct line that connects to an operator. The operator, while unable to answer any computer-related questions, is able to transfer you to a live person in the Abuse department. Not that it helps any. Comcast threatens disconnection if usage doesn't fall within their limitations, which are unknown to users. If I am disconnected, I lose a large part of my livelihood. I rely on the internet for communication, research, financial transactions, data storage and retrieval, and entertainment. Not only am I affected, but also my wife and son (who often uses the internet as an educational resource for school projects)."

They scheduled an appointment 2 days later between 1-4 pm. I called back 2 times during that period to check on their progress. Each time I was reassured that they were coming as scheduled. Then at 4:45 I got a call from the tech saying that they are running on time and should be there between 5-8pm. They couldn't explain why I was told otherwise. To make it worse, they said they'd fix the cable signal strength (nothing is wrong with the cable signal strength), but would not boost the internet signal."

I was sent a self installation kit as I requested, but then received a call saying that Self installation was not supported in Detroit, and I'd need an appointment to have an installer come out. So I promptly cancelled my service that day. Then I finally got a call from someone who actually works for Comcast in Detroit. He told me I never should have been sold a modem in the beginning of May, and that they are still going through detroit upgrading the equipment in some neighborhoods. Why doesn't anyone selling the modems know this? Why have they wasted ao much of my time? There's not one person at Comcast that has any clue what anyone else is doing. The national call center, which is where all calls for technical assistance are directed, is completely useless. They don't knoe what's going on in most local areas.

"Tamara of Elkton, VA","Nov. 21, 2016",1,"I have had Comcast TV/Internet/Phone bundle for almost 2 years. About six months ago I was charged for a lot of movies. Over 200.00 just for the movies. I contact technical support and put blocks and passcodes on all the movies and channels that were extra charges. Over the last 6 months I have been charged around 800.00 for movies. When I contact an agent no one can help me, so I ask for a supervisor and the agent tells me that one will call me within an hour. No callback. In my cable package I should receive 140 channels. I only get 15. When I click on the other channels a box appears and says I need to subscribe to that channel. I would really like to know how X-Rated movies were ordered on my account when I had no tv hooked up to the cable box. My bundle plan started out around 110.00 a month and now is 140.00 for 15 channels plus all the extra charges for the movies and no one will call me back to resolve this."

"Erma of Port Charlotte, FL","Nov. 17, 2016",1,"Worst service I've ever had.

After 3 1/2 hours on the phone with them they had to set up a tech to come out. When I spoke with a billing rep she was very rude, could not understand why I had an issue. Because this was all in the same day that I picked up the equipment I ask to cancel the service and I will return the equipment back to the Comcast store. Well she hung up on me. STAY FAR AWAY FROM COMCAST! On the same day I was there to pick up my equipment I spoke with a man that stated Comcast turned him over to collections for that has been turned in. He said I needed to stay away from Comcast."

"Tom of Englewood, FL","Nov. 17, 2016",1,"I wanted to put my service on vacation mode since I was not going to be in FL for many months. I did this and Comcast admitted this was the case. Comcast did not do their job and did not put my service on vacation mode. I called and their response was ""why did you wait so long?"" First, if Comcast had done their job I would not have had to call. Second, why are you blaming the customer for your mistake. Regardless of how long I took, Comcast made the mistake.I run a business. Can you imagine if a customer ordered 1 item over the phone and there were notes or a receipt to prove it and I charged them for 11 of the same item by mistake. Then, they call up months later and said I did not order 11 items. I know they only ordered 1 and it was my mistake. If they send an email canceling monthly subscription and I don't do it. That is my mistake. This has happened in my company. It does not matter how long they take, I made the mistake. If they show an email from 1 month, 6 months or whatever I have to refund them that money. Or I have to refund them for the items because I made the mistake. Comcast made a mistake and has the nerve to blame me. Regardless of time, they made the mistake. This is the problem with big companies today. Comcast has terrible customer service. They say all the time ""why don't you call"". Because, I don't have time to spend 1 hour on the phone every time. I live in another state and I spent many hours on the phone once and the problem still was not resolved. In the end, I had to tell them how to fix it. Another issue is an account issue with them that is still not resolved even though I have called about it several times. Comcast has the worst customer service and they are more than happy to charge you for things but when they make a mistake they don't care."

"Bill of Fort Collins, CO","Nov. 17, 2016",1,"I have been a Comcast/Xfinity customer before. I had signed up DirecTV only to see the same annoying pattern to raise costs and get over $200 a month which is pathetically greedy on both companies part. I resigned with Comcast/Xfinity and signed up for what they described as ""The Ultimate Package"". I state that by defining their package as the ultimate one should assume that HD was included. When they sent me the pricing, one would think that it was all-inclusive, meaning all costs were to be stated in this fixed 3-year agreement. That also implied costs were to be fixed over this period. First they slap on an unexpected $10 a month charge Š—– not stated in the contract Š—– for High Def TV. When I complained they said ""There's nothing we can do about it"".The special was advertised as $129 and we had 4 TV's so that added initially 3 $8 a month charges until we had to cut the full services to two TV's so we just get regular channels on those two for about $4 a month each. One Land Line and a fast always-on internet connection was also part of the deal. Comcast warns us that if we violate the deal and cancel, we will still be charged for a high percentage of our contract. Our bill jumps up to $171 a month and we asked why but no good answers. Then it hit $178 a month. Now my wife shows me the bill and it is $198 a month on a fixed rate contract. I believe they are in violation of their own contract. But it gets worse. When I switched back to Comcast their support team was key in setting up my email as they are the ISP. When my Hostgator domain hosting expired I switched to GoDaddy and they said Š—“Your ISP provider will help you with your email.Š—I called several times and each time they denied it was their responsibility. Some spoke English OK but some struggled. Most seemed incapable of a fair decision yet they did not escalate my call. My email is up, down, up, down and it was frustrating. GoDaddy helped me to understand why and an email trace clearly shows all the times I could not send or receive email, was a Comcast issue. That belies the fact that we pay for a fast, always-on internet connection. As I type this I am waiting 3 hours for my email to go out. No such luck. I help companies to shape high-value brands.What Comcast/Xfinity is doing will create a strong market backlash when any other provider offers lower cost, customized plans. I do not need 80 Spanish channels. I wonder how many others are being ripped off and whose contracts are violated as mine is. We are reasonable people but a class action suit seems in order. We are retired and live on a fixed income. This just is not right. Comments are welcomed."

I was trying to start a business where I need a computer but because they were penetrating to my computers it's not possible. Business account is supposed to be more secure so they dropped me back to the residential account.In Colorado Comcast has a monopoly position and most of the people has it. Yeah, there is a some smaller internet service providers but they have the same attitude than Comcast. It seems like Comcast is spying us, maybe for a government, without any reason. I wonder when we are going to get search warrant, ha hah, that we would know what the hell is going on. I'm not imagining this I have plenty of evidence.

"Dann of Los Alamos, NM","Nov. 14, 2016",1,"Had been a customer of Comcast for years. Their service and their technical support were good. I have never been happy with their installations nor with their customer support. I recently moved and I had planned to go with CenturyLink, but they only offer 5Mb in my area. So, I made the mistake of calling Comcast. I didn't trust the installer from the beginning. Some of his lies were obvious, like our old router wouldn't work even though it is the same model of Xfinity that he installed. He insisted that the wall plate had to go in the middle of the wall, both horizontally as well as vertically. He tried drilling through the wall and found solid concrete. Then he tried higher up with the same result. Finally he resorted to tapping the wall and found that it was frame just a few inches higher than where he drilled. The wall plate was put in such that it has an obvious bow. It was so unprofessionally done that I paid to have another real Comcast guy come out (I guess the first one was a contractor). He admitted the job was very shoddy. At least he made an effort to route the cable so that it didn't destroy my house, and made some suggestions, but in the end agreed that the wall plate had to go at least near where it was. He said that Comcast would fix the holes in the wall and would get the cable off the ground where the first guy left it. Next day, Comcast called me and said that I insisted that the wall plate go where the first hole was drilled. More lies. I didn't want it anywhere near there. So, he said, Comcast would, out of the kindness of their hearts, pay for half the repairs. I said that was unacceptable. They said I would have to get an estimate and submit it to them. I think they should just get someone out there and get it fixed, skipping the estimate and the infinite mound of red tape that Comcast Accounting is known for. Tomorrow I am having CenturyLink connected. If I can live with their ""dedicated 5Mb"", I'll pay the $50 penalty for early withdrawal from Comcast, and fix the wall myself. My recommendation: try everyone first before you call to have Comcast come out and destroy your home."

Comcast has worse customer service, managers just repeat same information like a robot, without giving you clarity what happened to your billing that you never received and apparently you owe some money after one year. They try to sell you the service and lie to you about the billing and suddenly you get the bill that you have not agreed upon. They assure you to fix the error and it takes them 3 month to fix it. They have worse billing system ever! Worse customer service ever! And worse management! THERE IS NO ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"".

How many more appointments are they going to make? When are they going to show. As a customer I am expected to pay my bill. As a customer, I expect to get service."
"Christine of Blackstone, MA","Nov. 8, 2016",1,Absolutely awful. Constant problems. I don't watch a lot of tv. Every time I do put it on my channels won't show up that I'm already subscribed to saying to subscribe to get them so I have to contact them and go through the same hassle over and over again. Ridiculous.
"M. of Warren, MI","Nov. 7, 2016",1,"Comcast is the WORSE cable provider!!! They take your money and lie to you and when it's time for your money to be refunded they give you the runaround with different representatives telling you different stories. They say you'll receive your money within a week while another representative says it takes 4-6 weeks to receive a check when a ""check"" wasn't provided. When the money was taken out of my account it was done immediately!!! Then to call in numerous times throughout the day to find out the refund request was never put in. Money was taken on October 14 and yet I'm nearing a month to be told the request was never put in back in October and I should be receiving a check by the second week of December! POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE and they do nothing but give false pretenses and lie!! What a waste and I will NEVER go back to them again!! Let's just see how long it takes for me to ACTUALLY receive a check!! HOPEFULLY THIS PROCESS WENT THROUGH THIS TIME!!"
"Lacey of Paulsboro, NJ","Nov. 7, 2016",1,They charge you all this money and they can never tell you what's wrong with your cable. Then they make you wait 2-3 days to get a technician out when you pay for the in-home service. Back to DirecTV I go.
"Jelizia of Houston, TX","Nov. 6, 2016",1,"Their customer service reps and their loyal team don't know what the hell they are doing! Comcast likes to take it upon themselves and charge you double the amount for the same services you have been getting for the past year. No courtesy call or letter a few months before to give you an option to pick another plan, instead they make your choice for you."
"Corey of Westminster, CO","Nov. 5, 2016",1,"Bill keeps going UP!! I recently signed up for Comcast, Xfinity cable service and locked in service for 24 months. The rep I went through told me I was locked in for 24 months, and I was very animate about this being the case. The first months bill was exactly what I was told. The second month it already went up. I was told, and promised this would not happen. I was lied to!! This company is nothing but used car salesman trying to make a buck and they will rip you off to the full extent of their ability. They will lie right to your face and not even blink!! I am currently researching how to get out of this contract as it was not represented honestly, and is not what I was promised. I am to the point of not trusting anyone in the telecom business and I have yet to find someone with any morals and honesty in them!!"
"Pamela of Pittsburgh, PA","Nov. 5, 2016",1,"Comcast/Xfinity - this company expects you to pay a bill for services not rendered which is fraud. I have called in complaining about the lack of service at my multiple TV home. I also have Internet and a landline required for me to work remotely. I have missed work as a result of this. The service is spotty; many times there is not a dial tone on the phone in my home where children are present rendering them unable to make or receive calls. Yet, I am expected to pay a bill discounted for $20 for the ""inconvenience"". Is not showing up for your job inconvenient? Is not having phone service in your home, even in case of emergencies, inconvenient? I think not. The company also places the onus on the customer to call back in to get a credit. Why should I? You already know the service isn't working. I have called you nearly every day this month. Not looking for free service. I seek only a consistent service that stays on 24 x 7 x 52 - that's what I am paying for. Do what you say you will do or I will find a cable service who can! I want a credit on my account for an entire month's service. My time is indeed worth something to. When I decide to leave due to your satisfaction guarantee, do not penalize me! I've held up my end of the bargain."
"Erin of Kennesaw, GA","Nov. 4, 2016",1,On October 3rd 2016 I notified Comcast I would be moving states but keeping and installing the same equipment I already had. I gave them my disconnect date of 10/14 and my start date for my new address on 10/15. On 10/15 my old account was charged my regular bill. It is now 11/4/2016 and I have spent more hours than a full time job trying to get a refund. Every time you call you are transferred to out of the country call center who is very limited on what they can do. When you ask for a supervisor there are always none available. Finally I was able to speak to a billing specialist in the U.S. and she refunded the money back to my old account instead of putting a credit on my new account. What good is a credit on the account that is no longer in service. I will probably never see my refund. MANY hours on the phone over $60 dollars! And I still have NO refund.
"Scott of Jesup, GA","Nov. 4, 2016",1,"Unfortunately, Comcast is the only internet service provider in my area. Otherwise, I would drop them. I can't begin to write about all the negative experiences I've had with them in the past two years, so I'll summarize... Most of their customer service personnel is completely incompetent. It seems nobody communicates with each other because I've had to place multiple calls to have the same issue resolved time and time again. They tell you anything that sounds good to get you off the phone.I was without service for 15 days last billing cycle. After 4 different technicians (and one no-show) came to my house, the problem finally got fixed. A supervisor at Comcast told me I would be credited for the days I didn't have service, but when I received the bill it was $8 higher than previous months. Now I've got to call and spend 20 minutes on the phone trying to explain the same thing to every person I'm transferred to just to get the refund that should have been applied to my account already.Comcast internet is nice when it works, but the connectivity is unreliable and goes out intermittently. It is very expensive. The customer service department needs more training and nobody seems to communicate with each other or apply notes to your account so they can reference them the next time you have to call in. If you have another decent option - DO NOT USE COMCAST."
"Jaime of Ypsilanti, MI","Nov. 3, 2016",1,"Up until 5 years ago I had great experiences with Comcast. Slowly over those 5 years little things occurred and now are adding up... Sadly I have two options-- them or AT&T-- who is the less of two evils. Anyways... Now I am almost to my 20 year anniversary of being with company, MONTHS away, and I am leaving. After 20 years you would think they care about losing you-- not in the least bit. I have paid my bill on time every month until I had a little misfortune the past 7 months and got behind. I couldn't believe after I gave my loyalty all those years they wouldn't work with me at all on getting back on track. While customer service cried out apologies it was fake and underneath cold. Tonight when I called to get information on what I needed to do to have my account closed they offered up the information so quick it was easy to place order with AT&T. I figure I would rather get treated like ** by a company that I have no ties with than by a company that holds no value in a 20 year customer. It's truly crazy to me. Esp since the guy recognized the year my service began with them, yet didn't try to stop me from leaving. So long Comcast... I hope everyone realizes what an awful company you are and abandons your services. Maybe you would care then."
"mayra of Miami, FL","Nov. 2, 2016",1,"I have had to call Comcast several times for the same problem. The picture on the tv often breaks up, it happens on 2 of the tvs. Comcast has sent techs to take a look and they inspect and say it should be working correctly now. Not correct, the problem persist. Last time they sent a tech changed a splitter and said it should work. Not correct. Now they are charging for the cable they changed and for the visit saying it was a third company contract. I only contract and contact Comcast. I am totally exhausted of dealing with their intent to confuse, lie and their constantly raising the bill even when I'm supposed to be under a 2 year contract."
"Kesha of Richmond, VA","Nov. 2, 2016",1,"Unfortunately due to me moving to a newly constructed area I was unable to transfer my FIOS services and was forced to once again begin a relationship with Comcast. This experience has been nothing but horrible from day 1 to say the least. I have called numerous times regarding faulty equipment, upgrade not working properly and most recently my internet services are not operable. I work from home for 90% of job functions and have been unable to be 100% effective for a day and 1/2 due to my internet service going in and out mostly out for a reason no one can tell me. I have placed several calls in which I have been instructed to disconnect coaxed cords etc so a new signal could be sent. I literally had to locate a wrench within my home to unscrew the cord because it was so tight per installation.Now I was offered a $10 credit, however for what I pay each month which is well over $200 this is absolutely ridiculous and $10 will not cut it, not when I have lost 2 whole days of work. The rates this company charges vs. the service you as a consumer receive should be illegal. Constant issues with no resolve, horrible customer service, repeated technician visits with no resolve (they are supposed to be the experts however still cannot help you), and at the end of the day services that have been PAID for still do not work. Horrible, horrible, horrible company!!"
"Jennifer of Wheatridge, CO","Nov. 2, 2016",1,The services provided by Comcast are ridiculous. You pay lots of money for no adequate service. Everything keeps dropping from the cable to the internet to the phone on important calls. It takes hours to get the customer support. Called them just to find out you need yet another technician out here and have to call back again for credit for the time and services you have lost. Do yourself a favor and go with another company.

"Becky of Denver, CO","Nov. 2, 2016",1,"I had Comcast/Xfinity years ago and was able to get rid of them for a few years and was very satisfied with other companies. I unfortunately have had the displeasure of having to get them again because the complex I live in has some sort of deal with them. I hate everything about this company; the customer service, the hidden fees, the content connection issues. I now know to ask when moving into a new place if they will allow other Internet/cable companies because I really can't stand dealing with this awful company."
"Jen of Littleton, CO","Nov. 1, 2016",1,"In May the Comcast line was cut during a neighbors fence installation. Since May I have placed a dozen calls to have them come bury or fix the big temporary line that is STILL strung through my yard. What a bunch of lazy, non helpful people that Comcast has working for them. Still nothing has happened with this utility line but I guess it has only been 6 months! I'll continue to hold my breath until the Dispatch guy calls!"
"Patty of Lewes, DE","Oct. 31, 2016",1,"On demand has not worked since install June 2013. Spent over 100 hours on calls to Comcast. I have spent close to $5000.00 in payment. I was told to buy new X equipment and DVR, it would solve my problem. It has not. They have charged me for service calls. Why? System does not work as told/purchased from Comcast. If I buy on demand, shouldn't it work? If I buy a DVR shouldn't it work? If I rent a movie shouldn't it work? If I pay my bill monthly shouldn't I get what I am paying for? I have written a letter to BBB. I want a three year refund from Comcast. I am not holding my breath to hear from anyone."
"Steven of Mercer Island, WA","Oct. 30, 2016",1,"The Comcast X1 box would be great if it worked. On my box tonight the I could not watch my recording (World Series) from the beginning because the ""watch"" dialog box did not appear until later, after had to watch my game live starting at the middle of the game. Then the auto-extend did not work and it only recorded the three hours originally scheduled instead of the entire game. This meant I had to see the World Series game starting in the 4th inning and watched it until it cut off in the bottom of the 7th. The Comcast agent told me other users were having the same problem and ""they are aware of it and working to fix it."" I've had this issue many times now since I've had the X1. Why put out a technology when it does not work?"
"Lynn of Bloomfield, MI","Oct. 28, 2016",1,"Comcast service is absolutely horrendous. We continually have slow internet, problems with connecting to on demand service. Have had the cable box replaced at least 3 times. You can NEVER speak with any person in the US, wait times are always long, you are never allowed to speak with a supervisor AND when we demand a correction on our bill for charges when we have had no service they want US to call them back to connect to a different dept to request a refund!! They are the WORST for service and customer service. I hate Comcast. I am a working person and DO NOT have time to sit on the phone for 30 minutes or more during my work day!!!!"
"Tisheia of Woodridge, IL","Oct. 27, 2016",1,"I will start off saying that the customer service reps and even some of the corporate service reps need more training/coaching, this has been the WORST experience I've ever had with a cable company and I never want to deal with Comcast again. They misapplied $104 of my money and put it towards another account in my name that was already closed two years ago! In the beginning of this foolishness, reps told me they didn't know where the money was at and it was never applied to my account, which irritated me to no end on how you don't know where my money went. Then when I asked an agent in the store who was awesome where the money was, he quickly found it in an account that was closed. I called them back and was told I'd have to wait 10 days before someone would talk to me about this issue!Now I became irate and called Corporate and spoke to someone very kind and helpful who escalated the situation so I could get my refund. Here is the bs... A woman called me and said she was a supervisor from corporate office in Philly and she was going to help me (yeah right). So she was very snide and rude, she proceeded to tell me that she has to ""investigate"" and pull the conversation up where I told agents I wanted to cut my service. I told her to do what she has to do to return my money, now I have yet to hear back from this woman and I called back today!I was told today I had to POSSIBLY wait until November 2nd to hear back about my refund and it was a possibility that it would be given by check in the mail!!! Now I told them that I didn't pay that out by check and to refund my funds the way it was paid out. Why should I have to wait almost 10 days when it took less than 2 mins to take it out my account. I will NEVER recommend Comcast to anyone and I will never use them ever again!"
"Patrick of Bayville, NJ","Oct. 27, 2016",1,I have not been able to send an email for over a week. I have been a customer with Comcast for over thirty years and they still don't get it. I have been on the phone for over 5 hours in the last three days to fix my email. My last conversation with the resolution team was that their tech support will contact you in 24 to 78 hours. It is beyond that and they still have not contacted me. Where do I turn to next. This is what happens when you only have Comcast to choose from.
"Scott of Chicago, IL","Oct. 27, 2016",1,"I am on the phone with Comcast once a week because they attempt to overcharge me repeatedly. They are the only service provider available in my building. Each time I call, the billing department apologizes for the mischarge of however much, but it happens so often that it's obviously baked into their strategy. I would do anything to switch to another provider. This company is horrible and the worst I've ever dealt with. It's no mistake that I have to haggle with them multiple times a month to remove unrequested charges. They also will tell you they've credited my account, and then say they were not referring to a credit but rather their bundle promotion (discount that is hardly a discount). Two very different things. Company is such a scam and something needs to be done!"
"Brandon of West Springfield, MA","Oct. 26, 2016",1,"Comcast has been terrible to work with at every turn. Every time I've had to call them to discuss charges on my bill, rate increases, slow internet and cable issues. I've spent over a half hour on the phone and usually do not get the issue resolved. If there was any other company available to use for internet and TV in my area I would immediately switch.Today, my fianc’© wanted to take over the Comcast bill when we moved so we were getting it turned on in her name. We entered our new address on the website and it gave us a listing of packages based on our address, we clicked ""add to cart"" on the one we wanted and it brought us to higher priced packages. Their customer ""service"" said that it wasn't available in our area but as indicated in the screenshot image attached, they are advertising it as available based on our address. Finally they agreed that it should be available for our area but told us to clear our cookies. We cleared our cookies and it immediately disconnected us. The problem continued and we literally had the exact same conversation with the next customer service rep. After I refused to clear the cookies again he told me there was nothing he could do to help."
"Shelly of Michigan City, IN","Oct. 25, 2016",2,"We received our Comcast bill today for our B2B services for October. What is normally approximately $433 a month, is $1,414.24! They neglected to bill us for 85 days worth of voice line service since August. After spending over 40 minutes on the phone to find out why this happened, I still don't have an answer."
"Roland of Atlanta, GA","Oct. 25, 2016",2,"Comcast sent me a bill 64 dollars more than what I normally pay. Come to find out someone said they collected a box from my home, which they did not because I walked said box into a Comcast Store to get the new box, in which I asked the rep if there was a monthly charge for. He said no... Now another Comcast rep is saying there may be in fact a 7 dollar monthly fee for the newer box after I've had it for 30 days. Sounds like bait and switch to me. Oh yeah, the other moneys came from Comcast for billing me for a box I turned in 30 days prior."
"Erik of South Yarmouth, MA","Oct. 24, 2016",1,"I signed up for Comcast being told 500 Visa card. I got charged entire bundle then I'm only got basic. Few months later I get the box. Box is not registered so I'm on the phone for days. Then I'm waiting 10 months for Visa card... threaten a lawsuit. I get 100 gift card and another one for 50.00. I called a high up rep who went through all recorded calls, restarted my bundle, and gave me lower rate for yr 3 and 4 then a 290.00 box credit for final year. So 90.00 to 114.00 was my quote and I'm also paying 250.00 a month being shut off 2 times a month. They were individually charging me for everything. Kristin ** I believe executive customer relation in 2015 fixed it all. Now Comcast tells me they're not honoring her deal. I'm being overcharged, plus I'm being shut off. I also am still 2 yrs later waiting for 350.00 left on owed Visa card and past the deal. How am I not getting? Visa GC IS A SCAM.."
"Gelila of Ponte Vedra, FL","Oct. 24, 2016",1,After being a customer with Comcast for 10+ years I called to see if I can change my service plan as I was no longer working. The agent on the line said as of July I was under another 2 year agreement and could not change or cancel my plan. I asked when I signed a contract and she said they Sent me an email with the discount they have given me and that is now my contract to lock me in for another 2 years. She would not put me on the phone with a supervisor instead she said someone will call me within 24 hours. I have been in customer service for 27 plus years and never seen such service. All the negative reviews say a lot!!!
"Susan of Port Saint Lucie, FL","Oct. 22, 2016",1,"Not only does Comcast Stink so does their Customer Service Reps. After 4 phone calls totaling over 2 1/2 hours, and a trip to the Comcast store (who by the way told me they only handle equipment and billing is only done by phone or online) totaling another 45 minutes, I have not gotten my problem resolved. After 3 years of being a customer with them, they raised my bill, first by over $100 a month. After my first phone inquiry they increase my monthly service by $200 a month. It turned out the first Rep I spoke with, without my permission, signed me up for a new 2 year contract. All I do is get a ""Yes, I will fixed the account"" and then nothing changes. I even requested an email showing me the updated changes another Rep promised, and the email that was sent was instructions on how to use online billing. If I behaved like this at my job I would be fired.I'm done, I don't do business with crooks. I could be driving a new Luxury Car for the monthly fees they are charging. Comcast is just as bad as the Major Banks that rip off their customers. They need to be penalized for their lies, deceptions and unauthorized charges. Do yourself a favor and do not get involved with this crooked company that likes to suck you in and empty your wallet."
"Rebecca of Houston, TX","Oct. 22, 2016",1,"Service is terrible... Customer service is terrible. Price is horrible. Billing is never correct... Bill is always incorrect. Often bill for service I do not have or have never agreed to. Trying to get help is impossible. When service is out, which happen often, it is impossible to get credit on your bill. I call customer service to get credit. They will lie and tell you the credit is applied to account. But after months of calling and recalling it is never credited. I don't ever take the time to write a review, but I am so disgusted with Comcast that I made the time to write and inform other people of the poor quality. Please please please do not go with Comcast... You will regret it. The price appear like a good deal at first, but believe me, it will go up sky high. I started off with triple pay bundle for 89.00 dollars a month. Years later my bill for basic cable and slow internet is 198.00 a month. Everybody I know that have Comcast is very unhappy!!!! Enough is enough. Time to go back to the old rabbit ears and cancel service and free myself from all the Comcast drama!!! (and file a report with the Texas Utility Commission and BBB...)"
"susan of Chandler, AZ","Oct. 21, 2016",1,"FOUR times they had to send ""technicians"" (I use that word loosely) to set up service. THREE weeks to get the service that is being paid for. Four hours of MY TIME calling these yahoos to get this fixed. I had Comcast once before 14 years ago and they were useless then. I guess they haven't improved!"
"Georgann of N Charleston, SC","Oct. 21, 2016",1,"Every review on here is correct in how they treat customers. I have been told I would receive callbacks on three occasions. Now in 6 weeks time, I have yet to hear from anyone with this company. They lie to get you off the phone and have no interest in solving problems. They cause more problems than having their service is worth. I honestly don't know how they stay in business. I called this morning as a last straw asking for their complaint department knowing darn well what I would hear and I did indeed hear it ""we don't have one"", that their CSRs can handle everything, no, they can't handle ANYTHING. I'm sure they don't have a complaint department. It would need to be staffed with so many employees. It would break the bank and they would be so busy you would be on hold a week trying to get through. It must be a nightmare going to work for them everyday knowing you are going to lie, cheat and have people complain to you all day long. I'd have to look for another job."
"Parm of El Dorado Hills, CA","Oct. 21, 2016",1,"I have had the worst customer service experience with Comcast. I bought a new house and signed up for service with Comcast. I was excited because they promised really good speeds at a reasonable price. I signed up on June 30th and after 4 Comcast visits they had my internet set up by July 7th (might have been a bit later). Then on July 31st I called to cancel service because it was not meeting my needs. The customer service representative was very friendly and proceeded to cancel my service. I told her that I also wanted to pay my first/final bill with them. I did this because of a bad experience my wife had with Comcast when she moved from Oregon to California. She said that everything was taken care of and I moved on with my life.About 15 days later I got a bill from Comcast. I figured that they must have processed it by mistake and ignored it. Then about month later I got another bill. I figured that I better look into this and logged online to Comcast's web portal and it notified me that I had a outstanding bill. I called customer service for a second time and once again the representative was nice but said that because I had initiated the service request on June 30 and canceled on July 31st that they would have to charge me a early termination fee.I responded that my first bill shows that service was started on July 7th and that is well within the 30 day window to cancel. He said he would speak to his supervisor and I waited for about 5 minutes. He came back and said that they would credit my account for the early termination fee ($110) and it would take a few days to update the system. I told him ""thank you"" and made a small joke, ""I hope I never have to speak to you again.""Then forward to today, October 20th. I received a notice from a collection agency that my Comcast bill was sent to collections. So I pick up the phone and call Comcast again (3rd time the charm, I hope). This time I am sent to an Indian call center (nothing wrong with that. In fact I am Indian) but she was very hard to understand, rude and a bit dismissive. She told me the same thing that the early termination fee would have to be paid and I explained that we had already talked about this before and that she should look at her account notes. She put me on hold for 3-4 minutes and then came back and told me she needs to speak to her supervisor. I told her ""go ahead"", (1-2 minute wait) and she says ok they are going to resolve and that she will put in notes her in account.I ask her would they contact the collections agency. She responds ""I will put it in the notes"". I ask her again, ""so does that mean I won't have to contact the collections agency"". She says in a dismissive way ""they will stop calling you."" I asked her ""is there anything else that I have to do."" She says no and then proceeds to ask something similar to ""hope I have been helpful to you today"" or something like that, and I told her that we would see. That this is the 3rd time I have contacted Comcast and that I do not appreciate it. She sighed and ""I am sorry""' and I told her ""it's ok"" and ""thank you.""I have never experienced this level of poor customer service. This will ultimately hurt their company and eventually bottom line. Customer service representatives should not have an incentive to keep customers at all costs. Just like sales staff should not make commission/points on each sale. Learn something from the whole Wells Fargo scandal. Comcast you are selling a commodity. Focus on making your product better so people want to come to you and not have sales people push/pull a poor product. Governments have already started to remove the monopolistic control you entities such as Comcast have over choice and it's only going to get worse. Avoid irrelevance by getting better. My $110 dollars that was sent to collections is only going to get more expensive for you if you keep this up. I hope someone within the C-suite at Comcast reads this."

"robert of Monmouth, IL","Oct. 20, 2016",1,"In our town of 9500 people Monmouth IL we have Comcast as 1 of our providers. Comcast is leasing the equipment from the old company that they got the broadcast license from years ago. Here we are not required to have a cable box. We don't have Xfinity or internet through Comcast. The problem we have been having is that every couple of weeks we have no sound on channels and this has been going on for years here. Every time I've called Comcast claims I need a cable. I've told them you going to tell everyone in town they need a cable box so we can get sound because the problem is all over town. The issue is with the old equipment in our town. Comcast will do nothing. The technician goes up and does whatever he does, flips a switch or whatever and wow we have sound. But every time customer service wants to send someone to my house I tell them ""Go ahead. I would like to talk to the technician that is screwing things up."" They say ""Ok we will send someone."" Well they never do and wow the problem is solved for a week or 2. In talking to Comcast customer service they are from another country and are dumber than a box of rocks and can't possibly understand the issue in our town. You can ask for a supervisor in the U.S. and sometimes that will get you somewhere. I have made about 17 calls about this and each call averaging an hour. Comcast does not care about it customers and some of the support people you call they don't care about your problems. Comcast is the worst company to deal with. They can't provide a service. Can't bill you right. They add things to your bill. Dish Network is looking more pleasing and getting more channels. Sounds awesome"
"Robert of Minnetonka, MN","Oct. 18, 2016",1,"I first contracted with Comcast for Internet 2 1/2 years ago. For the first six months (my initial contract), everything was great, exceptional internet speeds for a great price. As soon as my initial rate expired, not only did the prices become exorbitant but the MBPS started fluctuating and had very little reliability going forward. I have called or chatted with Comcast 15 times in the last 2 1/2 years to resolve the issue. It's always the same steps, restart your modem, restart your router, we'll send a technician, the technician arrives and finds nothing wrong, calls his support center, BOOM, magically speeds are restored. Mind you, this is how they get you to keep paying their service center fee so it won't cost you $70 every time they come out.Every interaction with Comcast Support has left me angry and I am far from an angry man. I have worked retail and service industry jobs and strive to treat these employees with respect as it's not their fault their company has such poor practices. Today however was the last straw. After receiving speeds of 1 - 10 mbps down all day, I finally made the dreaded decision to chat with them. After being disconnected from the chat, via their troubleshooting steps, reconnecting and then being disconnected to finally reconnect and their technician no longer being in the chat room, I've had enough. Conveniently enough, there's no survey link when this happens for me to report my extreme dissatisfaction. These seem to only appear when an interaction has gone well. I suspect it's at the behest of the support individual on whether they'll send the survey or not.Not only have I had myriad connectivity issues for an inordinate amount of time but my bill has magically risen. I attempted to get this resolved on four separate occasions and finally gave up after being stonewalled. There literally is NO POINT to bring any complaint whether it be technical or billing related. They will do NOTHING. The ONLY reason I am still a Comcast customer is that I have no other choice. This is the WORST company I have ever worked with, by far. As soon as I move, I will be choosing a new ISP and washing my hands of Comcast forever."
"danny of Naplea, FL","Oct. 18, 2016",1,"Our office phones don't work most of the time. I have customers calling me on my cell saying when they call the office numbers it says the number is no longer in service. This has happened over 20 times to us, that I know of. I personally called the office number 10 times today and I'm having the same result. Throughout the last several years I've placed multiple complaints to Comcast and I always get the same response -- there's nothing wrong on their end. I think if an organization or individual wants to kill a company or many, all they need to do is stop the phones from ringing. I understand why our economy is so bad economically. The only calls that seem to get through are telemarketers or organizations looking for money, ironically. Fortunately I have customers that have my personal cell and are capable to reach me to inform me they have been trying to reach us on the office lines without luck for several days even a weeks. We have had problems with Comcast for several years on and off but now it's really bad. This has nearly destroyed my company reputation which has taking me over a decade to build. If there's anyone else with a similar problem please step forward and say something. We had to move to a new location due to a flood. Comcast says my account is active so I'll be able receive calls without interruption. It's going to take them almost a month to connect the service at the new address due to the phone numbers have been miscoded."
"brenda of Ellenwood, GA","Oct. 17, 2016",1,"We changed providers for a cheaper rate in Aug. Comcast sent a bill for sept. that was charging me for month I didn't have service. So I called. Was told ""No you don't owe that. Disregard the bill."" Then the 6th of Oct. I got a call saying I owe a balance of 25.69. He explained the amount and wanted me to pay over the phone. I said ""Send me a bill and I'll be happy to pay it."" The final bill was generated OCT 6TH, I received it in the mail OCT 14th and paid it the same day on the 17th. I receive a notice from credit control a credit collection. THIS IS HOW YOU WILL BE TREATED AFTER BEING WITH THIS COMPANY FOR YEARS WITH NEVER A LATE BILL. NOT ONE."
"Carolina of Miami, FL","Oct. 17, 2016",1,"I bought my house 3 years ago and Comcast already had a box in the backyard. While I don't mind them coming to work on it I would like some common courtesy of notifying me first. They have been showing up at my house at all times of the day without notice whenever they want to work on the box. While some techs have been nice enough to at least knock first and let me know they will be working, others just open the gate and go right in without as much as a notice. I have 4 dogs that I am now afraid to leave outside because they can either escape or defend their territory when Comcast walks in. It shouldn't be this way that I can't even let my dogs out without having to worry.I don't understand how police need permission to come into your yard yet Comcast does whatever they want. I know all about easement rights etc but like I said common courtesy so I can make sure my dogs are inside when they arrive. I am so tired of walking into my yard only to find strange men that I wasn't even aware they were there to begin with."
"Anthony of Washington, DC","Oct. 17, 2016",1,"Today as usual, another service outage. Can't even watch TV cause it's a puzzle. So tired of Comcast, I call every week because of a problem. I'm looking into even cable because Comcast is do ** monkey balls."
"Jan of Marietta, GA","Oct. 17, 2016",1,"I've had Comcast for two months, and every single day it freezes up. It doesn't matter whether I'm watching live television or DVD. I've become so frustrated. I don't even attempt to reset it anymore. I'm switching to DirecTV. I've tried to call customer service in regards to the constant freezes this service has, as well as an install fee they never said I would be responsible for. Yeah still waiting for a call back from the ""supervisor""... I'd say about 2 weeks now. I'm over it!"
"Julie of Cape Coral, FL","Oct. 16, 2016",1,"The NFL RedZone advertises that you ""see every touchdown from every game"". You do see every touchdown. BUT!!! I hope that's the only part of the game you care to see! With DirecTV, I could find my Chiefs game and watch the ENTIRE GAME... START to FINISH. Unfortunately, now that I am roped into a 2 year contract with Xfinity, I find out they don't offer any such package. The best you can do is ""RedZone"" which is crap! For example, Chiefs went into overtime vs. Chargers week 1. The problem was, RedZone promptly switched off my game to begin the following game, leaving me with only highlights (and yes, every touchdown) from the rest of my game! What a crock, these people! I will fulfill my 2 years, and then I will switch back and never want to hear the words ""XFINITY"" or ""REDZONE"" again!!!"
"TERRY of Port Huron, MI","Oct. 16, 2016",1,"I have never encountered such a mess with a company in 40 years. It never improves or changes. It isn't even worth my time to make a complaint or share my frustrations. Nothing will ever change, and there is complaint after complaint after complaint. In July 2016, I called Comcast because a large tree branch in our backyard snapped and was dangling over the Comcast lines. They set up appt to come on July 4, 2016 to check it out. July 4th came and went and Comcast did NOT come. I called Comcast the following day and was told that they were here, and didn't have access to my backyard. This was ridiculous. First of all, Comcast did not come and secondly, there is complete access to our yard. Comcast told me that the complaint was closed. I said this is ridiculous, as Comcast never showed. I ended up calling the executive office dept., and spoke with Anthony **. I told him that I was furious that Comcast would outright lie to a faithful customer.Because Comcast did not show, and lied in the process, Anthony worked out the monthly 12 month discount on my package. The monthly charge was to be $109.99 I was sent a summary and have this in writing. When my bill arrived, it was for $165.00! I have left 4 messages with the customer relations, executive offices, ANTHONY **, and no return call. I have tried for a month now to speak with this rep. I am NOT paying my bill or any late fees until this bill is corrected.Comcast is the worse company I have ever dealt with. They don't keep their word, they lie to their customers, the hold time is RIDICULOUS, and your bill is always wrong! I have been with Comcast for nearly 40 years now, and they don't deserve to have me as a customer!!! What does it take to speak with a human being and have your issue handled properly the first time you call? Please tell me, Comcast!!"
"Kay of Parachute, CO","Oct. 15, 2016",1,"Comcast has instituted its new ""Terabyte Data Internet Usage Plan"" effective 11/01/16. (I have only DSL through Comcast/Xfinity). My monthly bill has gone from $65.38 to $84.34 -- and there is no way to opt out of this plan!

"Dale of Port St Lucie, FL","Oct. 14, 2016",1,"I am a snowbird and spend half my year in Florida and the other half in Massachusetts. In May I left Florida from Massachusetts and put my account on hold but paid $15 a month so that when I got back to Florida in the fall they would automatically hook my TV and everything back up to where it was originally, including original prices and selections. I called Comcast in August, 2 weeks before returning back to Florida and asked that my cable phone and Internet be turned back on Sept 9th, a day before I got home. When I got home my cable was not working. I called customer service told them that I was on the summer plan and that they should have hooked my service is back up already. They finally got my cable going yet had none of the channels that I originally had, therein they did not go back to my original plan.After 4 more phone calls and getting me hooked up with a brand new plan, which is not what I wanted, I had to call back again to specify that I wanted my original plan back. I just received my first bill since coming back to Florida and it is $265! They charge me $20 more than my original plan and also charge me $97 to switch plans which I did not do. So I just spent an hour and 45 minutes being passed around from customer service to billing with no one taking the responsibility of who needs to help me resolve this matter. I have never in my life dealt with such incompetence!! If my account is not fixed within the next day I'm canceling my service and going to make sure I tell all my friends and family to cancel also. For multi million, probably billion, dollar company they should be ashamed and embarrassed at the ineptitude of their staff!!!"

I actually went to my bank and collected proof that the payment in question was actually paid in full. I took this print out to my local Longmont store and showed to a customer service rep. who proceeded to tell me that it was a fake, and that she would remove that charges or the late fees. I now get 5-8 calls per day threatening me and have had to deal with rude Comcast reps on the phone with no end in sight as to a resolution to this problem. Any contacts with them are not noted on my account but I keep records of dates and times."
"June of State College, PA","Oct. 14, 2016",1,"3 years ago my grandson was deployed to Iraq and his wife stayed with me at ** Port Matilda, PA 16870. I had Comcast as my TV supplier. I was asked to add a channel for $10.00 a month. At the end I could cancel it and get my bill back to where it should be. WELL after a year I cancelled the channel. BUT they did not reduce the price. I do bill pay through my bank so I had no reason to look at the account. When I called to ask why the bill was so high I was told they told me my price was increased. After a few months I was threatened with disconnect for non-payment. So I checked and it turns out I was being charged with late fees and charges. My bill was over $400.00. I paid it and packed up all my Comcast belongings and took them to the office. Imagine they owed me a $15.00 refund. I live in an apartment that is contracted to Comcast for the tenants. I refuse to use them. I use antenna TV."
"Misty of Jacksonville, FL","Oct. 13, 2016",1,"Okay so my husband and I moved to our new residence on 10/1/16. Our appointment to set up cable and internet was FIRST scheduled for 10/6/16 from 3-5 P.M. That one was canceled due to hurricane Matthew who was expected to hit on 10/7/16. Fine, I understand that, no big deal. So they re-scheduled for 10/13/16 from 8-10 A.M. I thought that was a little too long but still was okay with it. The day before my appointment, on the 12th, I received BOTH an e-mail and voicemail confirmation confirming that my appointment was still set for the 13th at 8-10. Please someone tell me why it's 9:55 A.M. on 10/13/16 and no one is at my house, no one has called me, nothing. I called Comcast and before I even get to a human being the automated message says ""I see you have an appointment scheduled for 10/19/16."" Excuse me?? That's not what the e-mail or the voicemail I just received the day prior stated. So I get an agent on the phone, he tells me that someone should be able to still come out today, and I would receive a call within 30 minutes to set up a time. Fine, great. Well guess what, no one calls me within 30 minutes. I even give them an hour, and no call. So I call them a second time. This time I get someone I can barely understand and he says ""Oh well I'm so sorry but it looks like the earliest possible appointment would be Wednesday, the 19th."" Well that's unacceptable. My home should have been made a priority after my ORIGINAL appointment (10/6/16) was canceled. But of course it wasn't. I hang up on him because we are getting nowhere and I was losing patience due to the language barrier, so I call back a third time. Thankfully I get an American this time and I tell her all that has happened up until this point. She puts me on hold a few different times, attributing it to her computer being really slow. Whatever. So she tells me that she put my home in the system as a ""priority"" (why wasn't this done in the first place??) and that the earliest time available was 10/17/16 from 10-12 A.M. That still isn't good enough for me, but at this point I am physically and mentally drained that I just accept the time and hang up. To say that I have been horrendously inconvenienced is an understatement. I took time off of work and was sitting around my house for no reason, as I was unaware they changed my appointment time for no reason. And then, the kicker, I call the billing department and tell them that I expect my account to be credited the $20.00 that Comcast promises if a technician is late to an appointment. Well, the guy, Justine, tells me that since the appointment was re-scheduled, that normally wouldn't apply for the credit but that he would do it for me anyway. Gee, thanks for doing me such a huge favor. Give me a break. I am extremely dissatisfied and I don't even have my service yet!! I've tried uploading the e-mail sent on the 12th confirming my appointment for the 13th, but it won't let me."
"Stefanye of Dickinson, TX","Oct. 13, 2016",1,"I was given a new HD TV for Christmas and picked up an HD box at the store. I was told it was easy to self-install. It wasn't. After 2 hours and 2 techs on the phone, they told me they would send out a tech (no charge). I was charged $70 on my next bill. I called 6 or 7 times trying to get the credit to my account and each time was told the charge would be waived. Then on the last call was told it would not and could not be waived and that I would have to pay it. I Googled ""Comcast Complaints"" and came across this posting about contacting the FCC.I wrote out my complaint and submitted it to the FCC over the internet and within 24 hours I got a call from a Comcast Exec who was very apologetic for the ""misunderstanding"" and was immediately given a $70 credit. No reason we have to roll over and play dead or take their crap! While we may be powerless against the mighty giant Comcast/Xfinity, the FCC has teeth and will go to bat for us. Anyway, here is the link of the posting that helped me. Good luck! **."

"David of Palm Beach Gardens, FL","Oct. 12, 2016",1,"A new COMCAST XFINITY customer as of August 2016, I find COMCAST XFINITY Billing Statements are almost unreadable (the meaning of each line-item). When called (10/11/16), COMCAST Billing could not explain the charges in plain English. Considering the following, I'm totally shocked by the exorbitant first bill of $577 for the initial installation of X1 service first & second month in advance (for 3-way combination of TV / Internet / Telephone services). Late by hours for the initial service installation, their technicians showed up without the required equipment. To get the job done, a Supervisor showed-up late to rush the job and worked well past the agreed upon appointment window. The installation went into the night. Despite the fact I scheduled this first request for new-service in-person at the local COMCAST Store, the initial installation technicians arrived unprepared to install  one XFINITY Wi-Fi Modem, one larger HDMI X1 Box and three small DVI boxes to 4 TVs. Though telephone service was inclusive, the connections needed were not even looked. No follow-up appointment was discussed. It was then discovered service to one of the 4 TVs was intermittent and required the small box be unplugged and reconnected every time the TV was turned on. This then required a second service call that again had to be scheduled in-person at the local COMCAST Store. Multiple attempts to schedule service work-orders over the phone were a source of frustration as appointments were canceled by COMCAST's poorly designed automated systems. Having just received a second bill of $277, I contacted COMCAST XFINITY Billing to ask if there was a mistake. I was told the bill was correct. So, for roughly installation & three-months of service I'm being billed about $284 a month, and I'm not even receiving premium channels (like HBO & MAX). In my opinion COMCAST XFINITY is should be held accountable for price-gauging and extremely poor service. If TV is a luxury I suppose COMCAST XFINITY can do whatever they like. However, if their services are considered a Public Service, like any other Standard Utility Service, it is my personal opinion the United States Federal Authorities, FCC, and Florida State Government, and any other governing or licensing agency oversight should immediately act to fully audit every aspect of COMCAST XFINITY'S business dealings in the State of Florida. I truly wish there was another service option in my area. If I had any other option for service I'd permanently my dealings with COMCAST XFINITY. What a rip-off!!!"
"Z. S. of Boca Raton, FL","Oct. 12, 2016",1,"They never came to fix the problem and never came to give me another equipment.I have been waiting for them to return the billing charges that has been taken even though their equipment and the wall keypad never functioned. They also have been charging me in the past for SPORTs channels and other stuff that I had never ordered and I always wondered why their bill is always in the above 180 range, and now they were supposed to give me basic cable, they moved my services for fifty bucks, and again charged my 79.99 as if I was a new customer. When I called them to inquire they gave me some reason, that I don't understand at all, plus they removed all the HD channels from my package and still billing me 79.99 for a month. If it was autopay it will be ten dollars off they said. Let's see what happens this month. I am watching them!Updated 10/17/2016 - The first review I have provided here on Consumer Affairs, about my alarm system malfunction.

"Mark of New Castle, PA","Oct. 11, 2016",1,"I'm glad Comcast is being sued for 2.3 million, they deserve it. My bill is never the same, each month it's different and costs more.

"Jocelyn of North Charleston, SC","Oct. 10, 2016",1,"I called in on 10/4 due to issue with my internet not working. I was told that morning to give it a few hours and the issue would be resolved. I called later that night and spoke to another representative that was very rude! She was very argumentative and when I asked to speak to a supervisor she rather debate with me constantly. She would say things as follow ""You're not listening"", ""O WOW"", and, laughing as I spoke to her. So unprofessional. She then hung up and I called back and got your rep Gordon on the line in which I spoke to him for over and hour and got no supervisor and was then told that his Supervisor would give me a call back. Days later I have yet to receive a call back. I called back in on today 10/10 to make a complaint on my experience and I nicely asked for a manager due to me not receiving a call back and this rep then states there was no call back assigned. So she would have to set up another one. At this point I have called in numerous of times and waited days so I assisted on waiting on the line. Her response was then ""OMG"" and then she placed me on hold as well . And after long hold, I finally spoke to someone that stated she was a supervisor at first name Lena, but would have to go through another supervisor name Jonathon to have the called pulled. I asked her how are they going to resolve the issue and she stated she was not sure. So I then asked to speak to her supervisor because AGAIN I have waited for dayssssss. Went hours without services and NO ONE has recognized me as a customer and my experience with this very rude individual. As of today, because I have yet to speak to a manager that is able to recognize my tenure nor the disrespect I've received, nor the amount of time I have to spend to speak to someone, I WILL BE discontinuing my services."
"Nathaniel of Baltimore, MD","Oct. 10, 2016",1,"On Thursday a door tag was left explaining that my service (TV, phone, and internet) was out and that I had to make a service appointment to fix it. I called the number on the tag and made the appointment for October 10 between 10 am and 12 pm. At 12 pm I called to inquire about the late service appointment, and I was told to wait until 7 pm and a technician might show up. If that did not happen, then perhaps the technician will show up some other day. This answer is completely unacceptable. I will be filing a copy of this complaint with the FCC and consumeraffairs.com.Updated on 10/15/2016: After receiving reassurances from Comcast supervisors, a new appointment was made for today, Saturday, October 15, between 8 am and 10 am. At about 8:30 we were told that due to a widely publicized marathon, our house was inaccessible. We replied that if the technician used a GPS, the program would indicate which roads were blocked thereby informing the technician how to reach our ""inaccessible"" house. With this new information, we were told that the technician would arrive between 9 am and 12 pm. During our time waiting for the technician, a general contractor was able to reach our neighbor's ""inaccessible"" house. I was able to leave in order to render military honors at a veteran's funeral and return because Google Maps guided me past the traffic and blocked roads so I could do my job.From this trip, I personally saw that our house was not ""inaccessible."" At about 12:15, we called to find out what explanation Comcast had for missing our 4th appointment, (2 on October 10 and 2 today) and the answer we got was that a supervisor would contact us ""sometime today"" and that we should be sure to keep our line open. Considering the history of this service call, I can confidently predict that the supervisor will blather some drivel about how they care for us as customers and will offer that we spend another day at home waiting for a technician that won't arrive as is Comcast's custom. Although I am irate, I am not surprised as Comcast is renowned for being voted as the company with the worst customer service for about the past ten years or so."
"John of San Francisco, CA","Oct. 10, 2016",1,"Up until a couple weeks ago I was happy with my Comcast cable service. I like to record almost everything I watch on my DVR to watch at my convenience, and I like to browse the TV schedule and program my DVR on the Comcast website with my laptop. Their website worked very well for that. A while back they introduced a new website and encouraged customers to try it out with popups on the old website. I tried it and found it terrible, all style over substance with none of the functionality of the old website. Several times I gave feedback which they had requested which was very negative, and expressed to a couple customer service people that I hoped they wouldn't do away with the old website, and was told not to worry, that they wouldn't do that.Then a couple weeks ago, my bookmark for the old website took me to the new one. I called customer service and they acted like they didn't know what I was talking about. So I went to Comcast's online customer forums, and there were many complaints there similar to mine. The channel guide on the old site had a 5 hour grid, and the new one only showed 2 hours. The old guide had filters for My Channels and My Favorite Channels, but the new one didn't, so you had to scroll through almost 1000 channels, most of which aren't in my subscription. The old guide had designations for ""new"" shows visible in the guide, and the new one you have to click on each program to find out if it was new. It was virtually unusable for the way I had been using it.The forum thread complaining about the new website is now up to more than 30 pages, with minimum response from Comcast. They tell us to use the App, but I don't have or want a smart phone, and I can't afford one anyway with what I pay Comcast for cable service. They also make vague promises about improving the new site according to customer feedback, but many people on the forum gave them negative feedback when the new site first came out as I did, and no improvements have been made yet. We have asked them to let us use the old site until the new one can be improved, but Comcast has no response. Comcast has a monopoly on cable where I am, and I feel I am paying the same price and getting much reduced service for how I use it. It is much more difficult and time consuming to program my DVR now, and many other people feel the same way."
"Ray of Palo Alto, CA","Oct. 9, 2016",1,Why is MLBN channel 612 on the list of channels but not available. I'm pissed as hell not being able to watch my Giants. Why do you list 612 but not let me connect. Do I have to be some rich special vip user to see it? Pissed off and not happy.
"Yasin of Newark, DE","Oct. 8, 2016",1,"Because they even do not deserve a single one. I was using Comcast and moved to somewhere else. Then I transferred my service. One year later, my service was disconnected for no reason. Then they charged me disconnection and reconnection fee for $190. I fight with them for at least 3-4 days. Then they waived these fees. But later, my dissatisfaction with them made me move to Verizon. Now, they claim that I have a contract with them and they ask for early termination, although I did not sign up with any contract. I realized that they sign me up without my permission and put those waived fees on my early termination penalty. Now they want me pay those fees. I would never recommend Comcast to my friends. STAY AWAY!!!"
"Sandra of Pembroke Pines, FL","Oct. 8, 2016",1,"I've had Comcast for over 18 years and was very satisfied, until recently. I kept getting a message that I needed an equipment upgrade. I did not ask for this upgrade. I ordered the new cable box and was told that it was easy to install and once installed to call for them to activate it. I did, and they were unable to activate. They said they would send the technician and would not charge me a service fee. The tech came, he was unable to activate the box, he scheduled an appointment to bring out a new box for Friday 10/7 between 5-7. I decided to check and the appointment had magically disappeared.I spoke to Ray, in Ft Meyers. He scheduled another appointment for today 10/8 @ 5-7, this appointment has also magically disappeared. I have been told I did not have service because I don't have the codes for the service on my account, although I've had the same equipment and service since at least 2014. I've been told the outlet is disabled, although it is the only outlet I've used for 18 years.I've been told, I'm not paying for it (my Association pays the basic cable), however it is charged through my Association dues, so yes I do pay for it. Today it is because of the storm that hit hundreds of miles away, and although I currently have service through the old box, this is why the new box won't work and why the appointment disappeared. So I've basically wasted 3 evenings waiting for them to come out and install the upgraded equipment, they insist I have to have. This company is the worse at customer service right now and I would not recommend them to anyone."
"Da of Colorado Springs, Other","Oct. 8, 2016",1,"OMG! Just got off the phone with Comcast customer service. What a joke. So to start we currently have a very basic cable/internet package with them and I wanted to upgrade. I received a letter in the mail that stated; ""as a valued Xfinity customer you are eligible for this great deal."" It was the type of package I was looking for so I called the 877 number on the letter as instructed. Only to be told I was not eligible for it. Why? because I already had cable and internet... WTF...So after much discussion with the agent and getting more frustrated by the second I asked to speak to a supervisor. When that person got on the phone I explained to her that this letter is misleading and in fact a false advertisement. The supervisor acted very agitated with me as she tried to tell me this was a generic letter that was sent out to everyone. Well guess what COMCAST? You cannot send out a letter like this telling me as a VALUED XFINITY CUSTOMER that I am eligible for the offer only to tell me on the phone I am not. That is called FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. So COMCAST MANAGEMENT, you wonder why people are fed up with the cable companies, this is just one of the many reasons why.One would think that a customer calling to upgrade their service (which I am pretty sure isn't happening often) that customer service would be doing whatever it takes to take care of that customer. I will be filing a complaint with the FCC and FTC. Oh more thing, I cannot go to my local Comcast store to pick up the equipment. It has to be mailed to my house... again WTF. I so wish I had a decent alternative to cable (especially Comcast). Just remembered another issue. Another way Comcast is misleading customers. When it says you are getting over 140 channels, you are in fact NOT getting over 140 channels... Why? Because many of the channels are just duplicated in HD."
"lashunda of Antioch, CA","Oct. 8, 2016",1,Hello. I became a Comcast customer in May. I was assured that the customer service was better now that they were Xfinity. Well I received my first bill it was incorrect. I called and was told it would be fixed on the next bill. Next bill was still incorrect I was given some credit for inconvenience. Next bill I was told someone ordered something pay per view. My husband and I said it wasn't us so that only left my four year old. I asked the Comcast rep to put a password on my account to where no one could order anything without the password. We did this. My Oct bill has come with $80 worth of orders. Even though I told Comcast their representative assured me this would not happen again. They said they could only remove one movie. And I must put a password on each individual tv. I am highly disappointed and I would love to switch but I'm now in a contract.
"Carolyn of Plymouth, MN","Oct. 7, 2016",1,Comcast has been charging my small business $400-$500 a month for telephone services which is considerately more than using the internet for your phone service. I tried to cancel this service with them and now they are trying to force me to pay them a $4000 cancellation fee for cancelling before my 3 years of service is up (2 in already). I am sorry but I will never be paying you $4000 to cancel my service after you ripped my small business off for 2 years overcharging me for a T1 I don't have!!!
"Kimberly of Galveston, TX","Oct. 7, 2016",1,"We have had Xfinity over 2 years now and the service of the products they have get worse every year!!! The wifi works 2 out of 7 days but you pay out the ** for it just like the cable! Let's talk about the cable... ALWAYS a screen popping up on the tv screen...""something's not quite right"". Must be a loose connection!! Funny but the damn cable box is in the same place it's always been and it's been working fine but 1 day a week it decides to show this crap??? I guess it's overworked, needs a days rest! ENOUGH already, get your ** together and fix the damn cable to where we don't experience this unnecessary crap, we definitely PAY ENOUGH $$$$ not to have to deal with it!"
"wisam of Howell, MI","Oct. 7, 2016",1,"The customer service people are some of the biggest ** liars I have ever seen! I had an internet package with them for 59.99 and was happy with it then I was called with a promotional offer - for an extra 4.99 a month I could also get TV (40 channels including ESPN and 8 HBO channels). I get my setup box and install it and there is no ESPN which was pretty much the only reason I agreed to this offer. I called them and another agent tells me ""yea no problem. I will add ESPN."" And I asked again... ""NO EXTRA COST?"" And they said yes.So I had a bad feeling after that and called them yet again and just asked a different person what my monthly bill is from now on and they say 160 dollars!!! I called and screamed and my call was escalated to a supervisor. I asked them ""cancel this thing"" and ""I just want to go back to my original 59.99 a month for internet only"". And they say ""well we don't have that offer in the system anymore and that same package would cost you an extra at 69.99.""So I was lied to and they did not even have the decency of giving me back what I had before their people called me with lies. They are the ** I have ever dealt with. Also, I told the supervisor that I wanted her full name so that I know who I am really talking to from now on in case I get lied to again and she says we are not allowed to give anything but our first name. What a great way to hide their lies. Beware of these punks."
"lawrence of Boca Raton, FL","Oct. 6, 2016",1,Comcast never showed up for a scheduled appointment. They confirmed the afternoon before but canceled because of weather (which I understand) but never notified me they were canceling the appointment. No weather forecast changed from yesterday but they did not have the courtesy to let me know about the cancellation.
"Brandon of Egg Harbor Twp, NJ","Oct. 6, 2016",1,"I have signed up for Xfinity Triple Play including phone, cable, and internet. I was promised blast speed internet which I have not been provided since signing up on a 24 month contract. I have had several technicians out to my house to correct wrong/poor installation. First time when getting internet the tech spliced my TV and internet together causing slow speed and interference. Another tech came to fix. Another tech just came a few days ago and stated wrong cable was used and I would never get the speed. He had to replace line from inside my house to modem as well as the line outside running to the service box across from my lawn in a big green metal box. Several calls to Xfinity hours and hours of frustration as well as being hung up on. I was received internet around 35-40 in speed and blast is promised to run at 150 in speed. It was originally promised at 105. I am currently only running at 91.65 which can be validated on speed test link provided. I have been put on a 10 day extension to my bill and would expect credit for the breach of contract with Xfinity. Their response is I am on a promotion not even paying for it $13.00 per month is credit so maybe being I am on a promotion Xfinity thinks it's to not provide what was promised on my 24 month contract. I am currently on the phone with Xfinity after 35 minutes and being hung up on last night. After the rep told me it's the end of her shift then ask what a good number to call back at if disconnected, not more then 5 seconds later was I hung up on without a resolution or help. With my internet not working at all yesterday all day, I was able to finally fix on my own at 12:45 am."
"MIke of Boise, ID","Oct. 4, 2016",3,"First, the cons. Of course, Comcast is always trying to get more money out of you, no matter what. Often times I will find extra charges on my bill and they won't have any explanation for why. But, pretty much all the cable providers do this. What's great about Comcast is that the X1 box. It is far and away better than all the other providers, specifically in search and DVR. So overall, not great, but not the worst."
"Darrell of Gladstone, OR","Oct. 4, 2016",2,I am fairly certain that Comcast (Xfinity) went to the new format to make it harder for you to go anywhere other than within the Xfinity System. Not sure why but their TV Listings and ability to program from there were very workable. They did away with all of the TV schedule filters and various time elements. IT SUCKS BIG TIME! I have been a customer for about 30 years. I think everyone who has been with them for any period of time knows that new subscribers will always get a better deal. Customer loyalty is worth zero to them! I am anxiously awaiting full service Google cable!!!
"Danita of Conyers, GA","Oct. 2, 2016",1,"I was hung up on, lied to and placed on hold for more than 25 minutes by 3 different Agents. I was told I wouldn't be charged for a tech to come out only to get a email and it's a $50 charge."
"Carrie of Flint, MI","Oct. 1, 2016",1,"First of lies lies lies. When was it made ok to lie to your customers? So 2 different conversation were recorded by them where they lied about appointments with me. With them knowing my appointment wasn't scheduled on those day. I had no service and there was no issue inside the home. Two appointments were missed. After the first I demanded some sort of credit. I was given $40.00 credit and a new appointment (supposed appointments I mean). The technician checked the home it was fine. Then had to fix the connect at the pole. Yes it worked after that...and of course I was still charged $50.00 for them to fix a problem outside the home. (Exactly what I was told I wouldn't be charged for.)The business practices of this place are scandalous. Once I told the billing supervisor ""since your recording are not used for quality assurance I am recording you so once I'm lied to AGAIN I have the proof."" He stated ""I don't give you permission to record me"". I said ""I can record anyone I want from MY phone as long as I told you."" He agreed on giving me $25 credit but would not give me my full $50. This company needs to have a whistle blower's lawsuit started against it. I hear Comcast drama all the time from friends and family. In fact my sister in law (a top advertising agent) received a large lawsuit from this company for being fired after losing all of her hair and refusing to wear a wig! They are ** starting from the top! The new slogan ""we should fit into your life"" is a crock of **!"
"Jennifer of Lawrenceville, GA","Sept. 30, 2016",1,"Buyer beware! When you sign up with Comcast even over the phone you are agreeing to an early termination fee that they don't tell you about. If you order their service and cancel for any reason before the 2 year contract is up - didn't even know I was under contract - they can charge you this 400.00 termination fee. I had their service for 1 year, sold my home and moved to a location where they do not provide service.... Had no choice but to change providers and they charged me 238.00 for my early termination of the contract. Apparently the only way out of this agreement is if you die or are transferred by the military. The collection guy that called me was so ugly he told me, that if I didn't read my contract that was on me. Which is correct but I did this via phone so I expected something as noteworthy as that should be disclosed. Anyway, even if I had the option to use them again after this experience I would not! What a ripoff... They can't provide their service in my new area and they want to penalize me for it? No thank you!"
"Casee of Sarasota, FL","Sept. 29, 2016",1,"I've been using Xfinity for about a year now. For the first three months, they charged me with a more expensive package than the one I had. When I went to the store, the guy told me that he could only credit me back one month. Which made no sense considering it was three months I was charged for. So I called over the phone, and was rudely told the same exact thing. I went on to ask to speak to a supervisor and they told me that the two people I talked to were wrong and that they would definitely credit me back my money for all three months. This made me think if the two people I talked to before were even trained properly. Anyways, I was only given credit back for two months, but was so done with calling and hearing nonsense from employees who don't know what they're talking about, so I let it be. I also paid for the highest internet speed, which crashes SO often. Other times, the internet is just SLOW like waiting for a Netflix movie to buffer at least 10 times per movie slow. Moving on, I recently made a call to customer service about the change in price about my bill, and why I wasn't notified about it. The lady I spoke to was downright rude. I asked her to explain why the price went up, and with attitude, she said it's not their fault the price went up and that I should have known! How was I supposed to know if they never notified me about it?! Absolutely insane! Comcast definitely has the rudest customer service. If I could give zero stars, I would. You would think that with so many bad reviews out there, they would do something to fix their problems. I'm so glad I will be moving next month and no longer be using their service."
"Mandy of Boynton Beach, FL","Sept. 29, 2016",1,"I left Comcast 8 years ago because they were one of the worst cable providers I ever had. After being with AT&T for several years we were forced to rejoin Comcast because that's what our community has for cable since I joined about 4 months ago and it has been nothing but a nightmare from the day someone showed up to my house. On a personal phone call for almost an hour to come and knock on my door to tell me he couldn't install my cable. I had to wait another week for someone else to come out to install it on top of having a baby with no source of cable or internet. Moving on this Comcast installer shows up and spent over 3 hours installing my cable and apparently didn't know what he was going because since then we have had constant issues with our cable services, internet and home phone so I had to call and schedule a technician to come out to take a look at the problem. He was very rude, he tells me ""the first installer did a very bad job and that's why your services haven't been working properly."" So he spent another 3 hours in my home redoing the entire job so that it would be working properly.Comcast never offered to adjust my bill due to all the problems on top of having to fight with them continuously about our bills not being the correct amount. The first installer lied to the company about installing services and equipment that we didn't have just to make more money off the customer. I referred 2 family members to Comcast, big mistake that was because they lied to my sister about the package. She was going to be getting on top of Comcast, telling us we would be getting each a 150$ gift card for referring and apparently that was a lie. They are the most unprofessional cable company I have ever dealt with and I wish I would have stayed with AT&T. They are far more better than Comcast. I have now been sitting in my home for 2 days now without cable because of some power outage that has caused stress in my house and costing me money to go out and buy movies for my 14 month old daughter as well as me and my husband and having to pay for services we are not even receiving. Think twice anyone who shows interest in Comcast, it is not worth the headache and anyone you speak to there gives false information and never documents anything that is said by the customer. I will be canceling my services and will never ever go back to them again."
"Patrick of Henning, MN","Sept. 28, 2016",1,"Seasonal Convenience Plan - We are now on our 9th season with Comcast. It has not been a good experience, especially this current Summer. I filled in our leave and return dates in April via the computer. Comcast says they did not receive it from their end. Comcast acknowledges that they can verify that we have not used their services since late April, but they choose not to do so. Their position is that they did not receive the electronic submission from us as to the leave date, and as such billed us for several months after that. We live in Florida in the winter months and have Comcast service there. From about the middle of April until about the middle of November we live in Minnesota. We do not have Comcast service in Minnesota where we live. The dates of our leaving and returning vary less than a week from year to year. When I called it to their attention this past July/August twice they assured me that we will get full credit back to the middle of April. But in both cases they ignored this and did not do as they assured me. The supervisor suggested that the people that I visited with did not know their policy, but she did acknowledge that they had their way of verifying our usage dates, and they have our historical records indicating our usual beginning and ending dates as mentioned above. I offered to show her plenty of verification that we returned to Minnesota in April, but she declined to have that sent to her. We have it set up that Comcast sends the billing to our Discover account. The actual service dates don't fully correspond to our monthly Discover statement, so it isn't easy to know exactly when we receive the service when we look at the Discover statement.I acknowledge that I should have looked into this somewhat sooner than what I did. But, as a long-term customer with Comcast, and the simple fact that there are several ways of proving that we left Florida in April and arrived back in Minnesota later in April, I feel that Comcast is again giving very poor customer service. They are a very big company and sure push their weight around. It is very unfortunate that the FCC has permitted such few service providers, with so little competition. We strongly feel that Comcast should accept some proof from us that we left Florida in April, as we did, and credit us accordingly since then. And their supervisor, that I talked to likewise indicated that they too have a way of showing when we stopped using their services in April, i.e. cable TV, and Internet service. And, why assure us of the full refunds if that is not the case. That is very misleading. If their initial contact people don't know the correct policies, they need to be better trained. They also said each time that someone else would be contacting me. The first time that I called in they assured me the full credit along with a call back within 24 hours. No one called back. I ended calling Comcast at least 4 times. Such runaround, misleading information, and rigid policies only beneficial to ""big"" Comcast, is not good customer service! I feel that they should credit our account accordingly!"
"Renee of Louisville, KY","Sept. 28, 2016",1,"I am writing this review in hopes that I can help someone make a decision that could possible save them from an immense amount of unnecessary stress and inconvenience. I generally consider myself to be a patient and empathetic person. No one is perfect, and people are bound to make mistakes. With that being said, I'd like to share my experience with Comcast/XFINITY.I moved to Atlanta in October 2014. Upon getting settled into my cozy, downtown apartment, I contacted Comcast to set up cable and internet. I decided to move forward with a promotional package that included basic cable and internet for approximately $90. Initially, my first impression was that of satisfaction as the cable installer arrived on time, setup everything to standard, and was very charismatic and friendly. It is what happened afterwards that has left me very disappointed and beyond disgruntled.There was fine print in the promotional package I signed up for that the sales associate failed to inform me of. Apparently, this package was a two year contract in disguise. This is partially my fault for not asking all the right questions. However, the fulfillment of a contract that comes with a promotional package is something I should have been briefed on prior to my signature and payment information being supplied to billing. I learned of my undisclosed two year contract when I noticed XFINITY had charged my bank account $140. I, of course, called the customer support service to figure out why my monthly bill went from $90 to $140, and I was told that ""the second year of the contract states that the monthly payment increases to $140.""In August 2015 I moved to a different address. I called to have my service switched to my new residence, but this seemed to be an impossible task to accomplish. It took me almost four hours to get this done, and I called customer support six times before I reached someone who could properly assist me. Shortly thereafter, I received a letter in the mail stating that I had been receiving the wrong package my mistake, and that my HD channels would be removed. At this point, I was paying $140 per month for BASIC cable (fuzzy, horrible picture) and internet. I attempted to cancel my service, but I would have owed over $230 in cancellation fees. So, that was obviously not an option.Fast forward to September 2016. I am in the process of moving to a different state. It literally took me FOUR phone calls to cancel my service. Four. Let that sink in. That cannot be the standard. There is an obvious lack of training with the customer support employees. None of them are on the same page, and this was quite apparent after I was told something different about my cancellation request during all four phone calls. During my last phone call, I actually had the privilege of speaking to a young woman who possessed intelligence. She successfully processed my request to cancel my service, and after she spoke to someone in the billing department she and I both learned that I had no cancellation fee as I had fulfilled the requirements of my contract. My advice to anyone considering cable with Comcast/XFINITY: just Netflix and chill."
"karen of Orion, MI","Sept. 27, 2016",1,They are doing what at&t did a few years back. They promised to reverse charges for something an special ed child did and never did it and sat there and said they did. Such bull. I am thinking of going to at&t and maybe not ever come back. They need to fix the charges they promised to fix. Going around in circles with the representative and finally admit they are not going to do it after saying they would. More or less beating around the bush!!!
"Whitney of North Little Rock, AR","Sept. 27, 2016",1,"After 8 years I was very disappointed with my recent experience with Comcast/Xfinity. I contacted the company about transferring my service because the Commercial assured me that they could make moving easy. To me this was really false advertisement. Despite contacting xfinity in advance, I received two different appointments, which required me to be present both days and when day 1 arrived No one showed up or even gave courtesy of calling. On day 2 service personnel was an hour late and when he arrived he told me he needed additional help and would not be available for another week. No one took me serious. It's almost like the company treated me as if I wasn't big enough for them to show concern."
"Mary Eileen of Pittsburgh, PA","Sept. 26, 2016",1,"I contracted with Comcast after a salesman came to my door. I opted for the Digital Preferred package. Yesterday I went to turn on the channel CMT HD and message said I would need to subscribe to this channel. I have watched this channel before under the package I purchased. I have had the contract with Comcast for 20 months. When I called Customer Service I was told the channel was removed from that package and moved to another package and I could upgrade to that package. I was shocked. I have a contract that is good til 2/17 and to use their term ""early termination"", they choose to terminate a channel that I was contracted to have. HOW IS THAT FAIR? I get punished for early termination but they don't? I was told to go online and read the information (which by the way, took the representative about 5 minutes to find). He stated it happens infrequently but can happen. What if I did not have the Internet, only tv package? How would I know? The salesman did not inform me of this. To me this is a bait and switch. I paid for something I was promised and now they want me to pay more for something I should already have. I was never notified by Comcast. They took away (early terminated) something I have already paid for and want to charge me more if I want it back. Ridiculous. To me this is a bait and switch. Promised a package with one thing and after I purchased it, changed to another."
"R of Gallatin, TN","Sept. 26, 2016",1,"We recently moved to TN and found that the only cable company that offered cable tv in our area to be Comcast. From the start it has been a bad experience. After installation we found cables running over my flowers... the door to the crawl space left off thus allowing animals to enter under our house... basic shoddy, unprofessional work. I called them and they came and resolved the shoddy workmanship. A few days later I went out my front door and took a step onto the stairs to catch my heel in another cable running across my stairs!!! I was fortunate that I caught myself before I fell. I called and the fella said he would have someone out the next day. No one showed up so I called again and another appt was set up for 2 days later between 8 am and 5 pm!!! I was told I did not have to be there and I left for approx 30 minutes to return home and no one showed up so I called again and was told that they had been there and had fixed the problem...Well they sure had not!!! They said they would call me with another appt. Later that day a lady called me asking for very specific details about the issue!!! So for the 3rd or is 4th time I explained the problem. She said I needed to work with ""them"" and someone would call me within the next 7 days to schedule an appt. Here I am a week later and still no one has called or shown up to fix the problem. I was told by the last caller that I already had free HBO for 3 mo and $20 off my bill when in actuality all I asked for was for someone to fix a dangerous problem!!! I must also add that my cable ""powers up"" at least 5 times a day!!! I will be in the middle of a show and all the sudden the screen says it is powering up and may take awhile!!! I wish so bad that I had another option for cable tv... I strongly urge anybody reading this if you have a choice NOT to choose Comcast... NO professionalism in this company."
"russ of Skaneateles, NY","Oct. 7, 2016",1,"I'm a Triple Play, a seasonal customer of Comcast. I wrote an unflattering review of the Comcast service recently as they could not resolve an issue in providing service to our condo. In fact, the cable outside was damaged (intermittent) and they diligently followed thru until this tough technical issue was resolved. The Executive office in Orlando coordinated the support staff to work thru the issue and kept us informed of progress. I am impressed with their resolve to provide solid customer service and follow up. Well, Done Comcast!Original ReviewWe are seasonal subscribers - we have the Triple play with HD. We called to activate our service two days prior to our arrival. Spent 2 hours on a call with call center in Philippines - no internet, no TV. No success. Next day, had 3 separate sessions - first of 1 hour - they got the basic TV service going but not the HD or internet. Next two sessions of 1.5 hours each, ended in ""You're not subscribed to HD"" - a ridiculous statement. First two days of our vacation, I've spent listening to their distorted on hold music with them getting back every 20 mins to assure me they're working on the account.I cannot describe how frustrating it has been to simply activate an account that is on their system, that we pay for monthly. I've answered their account validation questions with each call, recited Serial numbers so many times until I eventually copied them down. I intend to send a letter to the ownership and see what other options are available... I HAVE NEVER HAD SERVICE LIKE THIS - TWO DAYS AND FIVE CALL TOTALING AT LEAST 6 HOURS ON THE PHONE - Still no success. I'm done with this company."
"Marc of Woodland Park, CO","Sept. 26, 2016",1,"Just off the phone with Comcast. I was transferred 4x and each time the person I was transferred to did not know why I was on the phone. Then, to top it off, I tried to pay my account in full, for the entire term of the contract, and they couldn't figure out how to take my payment. This is not the first time this has happened. It is unbelievable to me that a company in today's competitive landscape can continue to operate with this type of customer experience in play. So broken..."
"Steve of Commerce, MI","Sept. 25, 2016",1,"I have been with Comcast for two years. I was looking to add home security so I called to upgrade to Quad Play. There are very limited times when I can be available for installs. The rep told me there were just Saturdays available so I told her I would have to wait on the upgrade. All the sudden there was a Saturday appointment two weeks away. All set for the day I needed, so I thought! On the 14th I RECEIVED a confirmation call that someone would be out in the morn of the 15th. I called back and told them my appointment was for the 24th not the 15th. They said the day I needed was full and there was nothing they could do. Was told to call in the morning when the office was open. THEY DID NOT CANCEL MY APPOINTMENT. The next morning I received a call asking if anyone was home because they were at my house. No, no one is home and it was supposed to be canceled. Finally they put me back on for the 24th. All good, right! The 23rd came and I received several confirmation calls saying they would be out from 8-12 in the morning. GREAT! I WAS UP EARLY THAT MORNING. Waited patiently until 12pm. They have a guarantee and tons of commercials saying how they work around our schedule. LOL. When I called the CSR SAID she would create a ticket and send it to dispatch. I will receive a call within 30 min. Again hour later (1pm) I called again. This CSR told me to just wait longer that I will get a call soon. ONE HOUR LATER (2pm) I called again. This CSR told me she is sending and alert and I will receive a call in 10 minutes. LOL. YOU GUESSED IT!!! One hour later! (3pm) I called again!!!! This lady I talked to was very nice (MOLLY). She sounded southern. She said she had been with Comcast for 12 years and this is the worst she has seen. Knowing their history, I highly doubt that but she apologized several times and did get me an answer. SHE CONTACTED DISPATCH AND WAS TOLD THAT I WAS NOT SCHEDULED FOR THAT DAY! Let's not forget that I RECEIVED several confirmation calls the night before. After 30 min on the phone I asked to speak with a supervisor. She had to send a message to a super and get permission to transfer me over. After another half hour on the phone I got a Supervisor named SANDY. She told me after all this that it was not scheduled and we need to get it rescheduled. LOL. All she can do for me is give me the $20 missed appointment fee and that's it. I have very little time off and had to take this day off especially for this install. Taking the day off cost me approx $400. This is not even the part that upset me. I HAVE SO LITTLE TIME AND THEY WASTED MY ENTIRE DAY. If they could have told me the first time I called (12pm) after they already missed their appointment window, I would not have been as upset. I would have at least had half the day to catch up on other things. I spent my entire day waiting for them and about 2 hours on the phone to find out they were not coming and all my entire wasted day is worth a credit of $20. Nothing else they could do. Not to mention she was not empathetic and rude. When I look back I bet the original CSR did not want to let the sale go just because there were no dates that I could be available so she just threw it anywhere so she gets the commission. They may be told to do this because most people will just reschedule or make themselves available. In my case I can not just be there. They run all these commercials and spend millions saying how they work around our time. THAT'S A LAUGH. FROM WHAT I HAVE READ IT WOULDN'T SUPRISE ME IF THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING JUST TO GET THE SALE. I was on the phone with her for 30 min just to find the first appointment. Nothing available until I said I would have to hold off. So now after WASTING my entire day Sandy told me I would have to reschedule and the next appointment is a Thursday two weeks away. I HAVE ALREADY TOLD THESE PEOPLE I CAN NOT DO IT DURING THE WEEK. I HAVE ALREADY WAITED OVER TWO WEEKS. I am already being charged for the Quad Play and have not even had the equipment installed. Now I am stuck. There are no other cable companies in the area. All there is is AT&T U-verse/Dish network. I have had it in the past and was not happy with it. Comcast has a nice service with the X1 remote. Their customer service is the worst I have ever dealt with. It all started the very first install two years ago. I was not home when the tech arrived. He was here a total of 10 minutes. He ran in, installed an OLD box that had no HDMI ports and was full of Dust and dirt. Handed my fianc’© the remote and said ""You are all set."" No explanation, no literature etc. He did not even connect the Internet or phone. I looked at my bill and I was charged for the installation and set up of all of these. After an hour on the phone they took the install price off but since they have gotten it back. I have been double billed twice. For some reason the bill was double. Over $300. Also bounced check fees were added. I have not written a check in years and my account has never been without funds. I pay over the phone every month and have never missed a payment. I was able to get one bounced check fee taken off but they could not tell me why I was double billed. Was told they switched system so I guess the new system didn't get my payment info from the old but yet still no credit. I am so disgusted with this situation. I am ready to dump Comcast and go to Dish. I am trying to give them $200 a month but I guess that is nothing to the Multi Billion dollar monster of a company. Us peasants have to work around their schedule. Sandy also told me they do not have enough technicians that are skilled enough to install home security. This should not be my problem but I guess it is. I am a service tech for a large HVAC company and missed appointments do happen. In the rare case it does we do whatever we can to make it up to the customer. NO SERVICE CHARGE/DISCOUNTED PRICING/SOMETIMES EVEN NO CHARGE REPAIRS. I guess the difference is there are many other heating companies out there but only one cable company. We are at the mercy of this multi billion dollar monster. I don't even know what to do or where to go from here. I will be looking for someone that is above Sandra, the supervisor but it seems they are not easy to get in touch with. It's sad that they just don't care and since we are just peasants our entire day is only worth $20. At this time I have no appointment and am considering canceling cable. I have filled out the Comcast review survey they send out. I have not heard from anyone. I really believe they do not care! No empathy! ALL THE SUPERVISOR WAS TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE I RESCHEDULED THE INSTALLATION."
"Tanya of West Valley, UT","Sept. 25, 2016",1,Comcast is a monopoly!!! I in error paid my bill twice. In total I paid a little over $600. My first bill was a little over $300 and second bill was a little over $200. But was told I could only get a refund of $90 because my second bill already generated. My second bill isn't due for another week and a half. The agent and a supervisor advised that's how Comcast works. I don't get why I am forced to pay for a bill that isn't due. Don't make any sense at all!!!
"Devarsh of Fremont, CA","Sept. 25, 2016",1,"When I got internet connection, they said I can get 100 mbps with $59.99 instead of 25mbps with same rate w/o any extra charges. After 2 days in my online account it showed $100. I called customer care service twice and visited station 3 times from where I bought and talked about this issue. When I spoke to person at station, they misbehaved with me and said it's technical issue and will be solved in 24 hrs. It's already been 1 month and still it's showing due balance even after paying actual bill. They're blaming technical issue then I would say company need to solve this issue and replace those employees who misbehaves with customer. Billing information detail is not clear. I'm going with AT&T very soon if I doesn't get the solution and satisfaction very soon. I recommend people to switch to another company. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GIVE AT LEAST HALF STAR FOR RATING. TOTALLY RIDICULOUS SERVICE ASSISTANCE."
"Matt of Knoxville, TN","Sept. 24, 2016",1,"Tried to cancel service due to the customer service person being rude to my wife. Called the first person, refused to cancel my service without my account number even though they had everything else, said it was their policy. I called back a second time the person kept pushing me to reasons why I should stay. Finally he canceled my service without needing my account number. Another example on why Comcast is the worst customer service and disliked by consumers. They need to retrain their team and remind them the reason they have a job is because we are buying service which provides the funds to pay their salary."
"Charles of Miami, FL","Sept. 24, 2016",1,"I moved in July and moved my service to my new apartment. I had an internet only package and Comcast switched me to a plan with crappy cable for 10 more dollars a month. I contacted them to switch back to previous plan and asked questions about how my bill seemed to double. Two days later my internet is barely able to load my internet client and when I called to find out what was going on, they had no explanation and needed to send out a technician. THEN, the rep tried to upsell me to the same plan that they had automatically upgraded us to when we moved."
"Sara of Dallas, TX","Sept. 22, 2016",1,"This company is one of the worst companies I have ever come into contact with. They have no understanding of the meaning of the words ""customer service."" The actual service of the product is beyond piss poor with slow internet, constant problems with the land line (which basically is not functional with all the back ground noise that is present), etc. Despite multiple home visits they have never been able to fix the problems we have had, and if anything our service ended up worse and we were presented with an up-charged bill. Then when promised credit for services not received (which was often), the ""customer service"" representatives constantly lied to us about granting this. I had to call over 7 times and each time there was a bigger liar present and in the end we never got what we were promised (which is a refund for services we didn't have and shouldn't have paid for).None more so than the supervisor, Enrique. When a guy of this caliber is the boss then it is obvious you end up with ** employees. Enrique should be fired. Comcast will hopefully go bankrupt as it only seems to steal money out of its customer's pockets. I will gladly re-post this complaint to every review website out there about Comcast. Although quite frankly, it probably won't do much harm since they are only rated as a 1 star company anyways. This is such a fraud of a company. Even if you paid me $5,000 to use Comcast again I would never consider it. I can only hope that members of this corporation are ashamed of themselves and are treated the way they treat their own customers, because they deserve nothing more, and actually much less."
"Kevin of Roselle, IL","Sept. 22, 2016",1,"Comcast is by the far the worst company that I have ever dealt with, period! I have been receiving phone calls, emails and collection notices for months with absolutely no resolution. Please see my dispute of the charges below... Please keep in mind that I NEVER opened the box from Comcast and it was returned when they requested. I have spent hours and hours on the phone with this company and continue to be lied to and disrespected by their employees. Last note, I have no issue paying my debts if they are legitimate and around $80 is not a big deal but it's just principal.I phoned Comcast to setup service because I was closing on my new home. I agreed for the service to start in the beginning of July and they were going to send the equipment to my new home a few days after closing. My closing was delayed so I phoned Comcast and advised them not to send the equipment because I would not be living there at the time. They had advised me there was no way for them to stop the equipment from being sent out (nearly a week before it was supposed to be received) and that I would have to find a way to retrieve it. Once it was delivered I retrieved the equipment from the door step of the residence, in which I did not own. During the same call in which I attempted to stop the shipment, I was advised by the woman on the phone (Comcast representative) that I would not be billed until the equipment was installed and to call back once I found out my new closing date.My close date ended up being 6 weeks later. In the meantime I received a bill from Comcast stating that I owed a monthly payment. I phoned Comcast to inquire as to what the bill was for. I was told that it was for our service. After explaining to them that I do not have service with them she said ok, Š—“I see that there has been no usage and I will update your bill.Š— At that time I suspended my coverage (which I was told there was no cost for) and went on with trying to close on my house. The next month I received another bill stating that I owed twice as much as I did last month. I called and was told the woman that told me that previously was wrong and that I had to pay even if it wasn't hooked up. After hours on the phone, she stated that it was ok and that she notated the account due to my situation and the billing would be adjusted back to zero.The following month I received another bill stating that I owed more than three times more than the first bill. Frustrated, I called again and spoke with someone who said they fixed it (after hours on the phone). We asked for her associate number and for them to email a confirmation. No email was received so I called back the following day. The rep I spoke with said there was no notes on the account about anything being fixed and the associate number we were given doesn't exist after more hours on the phone and multiple calls they said they could lower our bill to $80 something. I thought 80 dollars for what??? Spending 10-12 hours on the phone arguing with these people? At this point I was so frustrated. I just gave up and cancelled everything and returned the equipment. Since then they have been sending me bills and emails for this payment which is not justified whatsoever. This is why I am disputing this!"
"chuck of Noblesville, IN","Sept. 21, 2016",2,"We switched from DirecTV to Xfinity/Comcast for our TV and internet at our previous address and we couldn't have been more pleased with the decision... until we moved. We were assured that moving was a simple process and that it would be seamless. That couldn't have been further from the truth. We moved from a develop neighborhood into another developed neighborhood (we discovered that many of our neighbors in the new home had Comcast service for many years) but they couldn't ""find our house"". They had to send a guy out to make sure that the house was really there and then determine if it was ""capable"" of Comcast service. This took many days because they never dispatched the technician to go to the neighborhood. Once the house was ""found"" it had to be entered into the system, which again took many days because someone dropped the ball and didn't follow through. All of these items took multiple phone calls, waiting on hold for hours, with customer service reps that were less than helpful. Once we moved in we were without service for 6 days. That's not very seamless. We just recently received our first bill. However, it was inaccurate, so to clarify all of the charges we were forced to call the less than helpful customer service reps who place you on hold, this time over an hour, because they cannot answer your simple billing questions. The moral of this story is Comcast/Xfinity customer service is abysmal. If it wasn't for DirecTV's horrible product, we would switch back in a heartbeat because their customer service above reproach. The only reason I gave a 2 star rating is because the products are wonderful. I'm just not sure if they're wonderful enough to have to deal with their people occasionally."
"Bryan of Wheeling, WV","Sept. 20, 2016",4,"I recently subscribed to Comcast TV and internet service. I am on the HD Premier Double play. I get all channels included on starter, preferred, and premium channels. This plan starts at $119.99 per month for 1 year. I added 2 Additional HD Set top boxes and 1 HD DVR. I also added 2 digital adapters. Cost of the boxes is $32, DVR service adds an additional $10. I also have a promotion for 1 year for the sports entertainment package. That adds $3.50 per month. I also have the Blast 150Mbps upgrade which adds an additional $13 per month. I own my modem. For as much as my 3 roommates and I watch tv, and the fact that we split the bill, this is a very good deal for us. It's about $50 each per month. Total after taxes varies, but is usually around $200. Overall, I am very satisfied with the service. But come on, $200 per month is excessive for cable when online services are $12 or so per month."
"Angela of Warren, MI","Sept. 20, 2016",2,"My bundle package has been going in and out within a 3 week span. The first time I called, it was a power outage from 8am to 5:20 pm. The next week bundle out again. I called on a Friday. Comcast rep stated the next available appointment will be Wednesday. Within 3 days the bundle is out again. I called Comcast they gave appointment for technician to come out was Saturday 12-2pm. Which tech did come out and repair. I called to see if credit was given, and the rep states ""yes, $55.00."" The rep states the computer compare total charges and give a formula of credit. If my total bill is $215.00 why the computer give total charge of $124.00? Comcast states they do not add the (4) dvrs and the taxes that I actually pay a month. Well to me that's a rip off. The computer should include the total charge, because that's what I actually pay a month. At least include the (4) dvrs if not the taxes. I was transferred 3 times and all departments have different computers, so every time I spoke with a different representative I had to keep explaining myself."
"Brandy of Nashville, TN","Sept. 19, 2016",1,"Comcast is cheating customers and charging extra for reconnect fees. I have been trying to get a hold of a supervisor since last Sept 2, 2016. My husband called in to dispute our bill. The lady was very rude speaking over him, and then he asked to be transferred to a supervisor and was told a supervisor is busy and not available but one would call him back, within the hour. Saturday morning 9/3/16. I called to get a supervisor since nobody had given him a call back. I sat on hold for 1 hr and 42 mins before someone picked up. When I asked for a supervisor the representative refused and stated something else. When I told her I could not understand her (she had an Indian nationality accent) she became upset and sent me back through the automated system, which then hung up on me. I called back a second time and sat on hold for 1 hr and 45 min this time and then I got a representative who stated he could not listen to my complaints because the call was going to be cut off, and so he had to do his part quickly and we needed to stick to only my billing issue, not the complaint I wanted to file against the previous representative. The representative stated he had taken care of everything and that we should not have an issue. Well Tuesday 9/5/16 Comcast disconnects our cable stating we owe 15.42. My husband kept asking where this balance on the bill is because we had been through this before with them stating we own money but nobody could point out where the money was owed on our account. He asked for a supervisor again and again was told one would call him back. Sat 9/3/16 we had just paid 242.50. He asked why did the representative not include this 15.42 and he was told we do not know, because he should have seen it. He proceeded to ask for the supervisor a second time and at that time, he was told one is not available but we will send over the message to have them give you a call. He informed the representative he had been waiting since last Friday for one to call and they had not. At that time the representative assure him she was sending over the message and someone would be calling. Thursday 9/15/16. I call into Comcast because our cable is off. I was told by a representative that the person I had spoken with on the 3rd did not put in correct notes. I asked why a supervisor had not called back we had been waiting, I was informed that she was not sure but if I wanted one to call me back she would send over the message. I stated this is ridiculous and after waiting over a week I expected a call back that day. The representative stated she was sending the message over urgent and someone would call me back. Mind you she did not even ask me for a phone number. She states she had corrected the mess up for the representative on the 3rd and that everything should be fine. I asked her about the 15.42 mystery balance she states ""I do not see this. I do not see you all owed 15.42."" I explained our services had been stopped 3 times during this week and I was not paying a reconnect fee for a surprise 15.42. I was informed that the fees would be waived and that our services were good until 9/16/16 which we could just pay on or after 9/16/16 which is the bill due date. I stated I still want a call back from a supervisor because this is ridiculous. Well Sat morning 9/17/16 the service is off stating again we owe the balance that nobody could find. I called twice after I went ahead and paid the current balance of our bill to dispute these issues that have now been going on for 2 weeks. I was on hold the first time for 33 min and 42 sec. I then got a voicemail that stated someone would call me back. I had left a voicemail at 0830 Sat morning. I left a voicemail by 3 pm. I called again because the dept I was needing to speak with according to the automated machine was only open Sat 8-5 central time. I called at 2 pm I was on hold for 34 min and 0 seconds. Again this voicemail picks up, states I need to leave a message and someone would call me back. I never received a call back on Sat. Monday 9/19/16 I call and I finally get someone named Johnthan on the phone and I informed him I was very upset and I wanted a supervisor. He then states he is transferring me to a supervisor. Another representative picks up the phone. I ask are they a supervisor. He states no. I informed him I wanted a supervisor, he informed me he can handle my issue. I stated to him no I wanted a supervisor. My issue had been going on long enough. He states I need to let him look into my issue. I stated to the representative no I wanted a supervisor. He states to me I need to let verify my account. I informed him I had already done this with the previous representative and I wanted a supervisor. He then sends me to a man named Josh, who states he is a supervisor. I informed him I was not paying all these reconnect fees for them not doing what they are supposed to do when the customer calls in, and expects Comcast to be competent. He states he will waive 1 $36 dollar reconnect fee. I informed Josh I was not happy and I would be going to consumer affairs. Josh stated ok and we ended the call. I feel Comcast did this on purpose as a way to make our bill higher. I also have a problem when you are waiting on a supervisor to call you back for 2 weeks and they do not, and then you have to leave a voicemail at a company this big and you still never receive a call back. Comcast is purposely ripping off consumers."
"Jeff of Jenison, MI","Sept. 17, 2016",1,"Comcast had a promotion that called out ecobilling, reps said ecobilling, everything said ecobilling. A month after signing up with their service, with ecobilling, they decided they also required autopay, and removed the discount for people without autopay, and then retroactively charge them for the change without notification. Discovered when using their online bill view and noticing multiple incongruous charges and had to get an analyst to even figure out what was going on, because the information was both opaque and not communicated."
"Lori of Knoxville, TN","Sept. 16, 2016",1,"They charged me for 2 months service past my disconnect date. I have had to call 4 times in attempt to correct this charge. They finally opened a review of my situation, stating they would contact me with the results of the review. They did not contact me, they sent my bill to collections. Everyone I speak to can see where my disconnect date and my billing date are two months apart, but no one seems to be qualified to fix it. HOURS on the phone wasting with this pitiful customer service before finally getting the bill removed."
"Paul of St. Augustine, FL","Sept. 15, 2016",1,"8 service reps in two months. Lied to, still terrible reception, phone drops calls. This has been going on for 7 months. Problems for years!!! I am going to small claims court. Paying for this is ridiculous. Suing Comcast! President Neil Smit at his office in Pennsylvania. This is just terrible service. They just don't care!"
"Robert of Humble, TX","Sept. 15, 2016",1,"Cable went out yesterday and spent about 2 hours troubleshooting issue only to be told that they have to send a technician out. Okay so when will tech be here? The only available day is Monday the 19th and yesterday was the 14th. So it takes 5 days to get a tech out to fix an issue. Internet is working but cable is not. I told rep that ""Xfinity has to enter my backyard for my neighbors connection and you mean to tell me that I don't get priority"" and they couldn't answer that. So I told them that for now on if I have to wait 5 days my neighbors will have to wait also. I knew it was a reason Ieft them for another TV service but I went back because Dish kept raising fees. I'm really pissed because Dish sucks in my area, always having freeze up and DirecTV is terrible. It's football season, no TV and these ** are telling me 5 days before a tech gets out here."
"Stephanie of Bellaire, TX","Sept. 15, 2016",1,"I signed up for a 24 month contract, was verbally told that the early termination fee would be cancelled if I moved to an area that wasn't serviced by Comcast. In addition, the service contract is vaguely worded and does not address this issue specifically. I am now moving with 6 months left on my contract to an area without Comcast service, and was told the fee would apply when I cancel. It is unclear how such deceptive business practices can continue. What company still charges for services when services cannot even be provided? It's absurd."
"fran of Phila., PA","Sept. 15, 2016",1,"I've been with Comcast since 1992 - obviously, I'm a stellar, loyal customer. Always pay the bill on time and have never had my service disconnected. In spite of these facts, I'd say for the past three years at least, practically every month, I've had to call and argue with them about overcharges on the monthly bills (I've not been under contract for many years). After extensive phone conversations with Cust. Serv. reps, and long hold times, the monthly phone calls about the incorrect bills inevitably end up with their Customer Resolutions Dept. - the big dead end, last stop specialists for those of us who are so frustrated and disgusted that we're threatening to disconnect.At that point, totally depending on who you get on the phone (nice versus rude and arrogant), you can possibly be granted a promised deal for the next 12 months - which, for the umpteenth time, is what happened to me on 8/4/16. I was told all incorrect past due amounts were removed from my account, I owed them zero; I was told to pay $169 that day, and the bill will be $169 per month for the next 12 months - got her name and ID # (forget calling back and asking for the rep. you spoke to last time - you're never allowed to talk to them again). By the way, same story over the years - month after month of fraudulently hiked up bills, phone calls, promises, then promises broken, followed by more hiked up incorrect bills. So I paid as requested for August and Sept., $169 for each month. Lo and behold, my most recent bill which arrived a few days ago showed a balance of $465.I called and went through the same old phone routine and got a really nasty rep. in Cust. Solutions who wouldn't budge, insisting I owe them $269. Furious and livid, I told him he's a stupid and arrogant SOB to take a chance on losing a great customer who's paid religiously since 1992. He hung up on me for cursing at him. I vowed that's the last time I call Comcast. I'm 67 years old and if I'm lucky I might have another 20 years. I want to stay in good health and that means reducing aggravation factors in my life, including one named COMCAST.So as of this coming Monday, I'm with Verizon Fios - I'll go out and celebrate after I drop off Comcast's crappy equipment boxes, etc., which I'm obligated to physically return prior to termination of service - for which I've obscenely had to pay them rent for on top of their greedy, disgusting overcharges for horrible services rendered, and the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE on the planet Earth. One last thing - about a month ago, they drilled into the masonry of my house without permission, causing cracks in the stone. The pimply 20-something kid outside said he works for Comcast and I shouldn't worry - they're installing new boxes on all the houses in my block. When I informed he he didn't have my permission to drill into my property, he said ""we knocked but you didn't answer"".I'm now considering a Small Claims Court case for damages - will ask the masonry guy for an estimate. Goodbye and good riddance Comcast! I HOPE YOU GO BANKRUPT THEN ROT IN HELL! ROBBERS AND UNSCRUPULOUS THIEVES -- I HATE YOU -- CORPORATE PIGS!!"

"Chad of Los Angeles, CA","Sept. 13, 2016",5,"When signing up for Comcast XFINITY at my new apartment in NY the Comcast sales rep promised me a stellar deal since I was switching from another provider. The deal seemed too good to be true, but I was being told the price by an official Comcast rep so I completely believed it. I should have known better, since, when I got my first bill, it was much, much higher than I had been told it would be. It turns out that this is a common practice. I did some research and it is called the bait-and-switch. During my googling, though, I found a company that helped me get a complete refund from Comcast for this horrible treatment."
"stacy of Arlington, VA","Sept. 13, 2016",1,"So these hateful people shipped me products I didn't ask for then sent me a 2nd round of stuff I didn't ask for... When I called I was told just send it back with the prepaid labels. UPS will come to you free of charge. Well... No. No, they will not. It's $15 per package to come to me... Then Comcast has the nerve to charge me $20 a month for the items I didn't request because they are in my possession more than 2 weeks... And I'm told I need to make time to get to UPS or continue with the $20 fee for items I didn't want and couldn't refuse as they were left at my door... What a racket.UPS can get $30 from me for Xfinity/Comcast sending me items I didn't request or Xfinity/Comcast can get $20 a month for me having items I didn't request or want. I called told them I work for a living, can't get to UPS, and explained all the costs and the fact that I didn't agree to have the items or accept the items. You left the items. Should I have left them in the rain to be stolen? The response was, ""Make time to go to UPS or pay the $20 or we'll cancel your service and send it to collection with the $20 being added monthly to your debt."""
"chuck of Olive Branch, MS","Sept. 13, 2016",1,"When I began using Comcast, I signed a two-year contract. Been a year now, I get a letter saying: ""We made a mistake. We haven't been charging you for your HD program, which is 9.95 per mo plus fees"". Lying, thieving etc. I don't watch TV but my 86 year old mom does. I'm about to tell them where they can stuff the oops. Each month is another bit of frustration dealing with this sham of a business and each month the bill goes up. I'm about up the here with it and considering unplugging completely. I'm on a fixed income and may just send them the bill in shreds and totally disconnect. Let them try to sue me. I have a friend that only does class action suits. I will contact him and direct him to all these comments. Really don't think they can squeeze blood out of a turnip!

"amber of New Bedford, MA","Sept. 13, 2016",1,"After settling into our new home, my fiance and I, after 3 years, decided to finally get cable (we both work all day, so cable did not seem like a necessity). Because of our location, only 2 cable providers were available, Comcast and Dish Network. We called Comcast first to hear of any deals, and the sales rep told us of an 89.99 deal they were running. Only wanting a few channels, the sales rep asked us to name channels that we want so he could match a package to us. We named HGTV, Travel Channel, Food Network, as well as a few children's channels. He named a $54.99 package with 75 mbps internet and all of the channels we named included in the package. This sounded like the perfect deal!Before getting off the phone my fiance asked for the full price (including taxes) and the sales rep said it would be $54.99 plus an extra $10/month for the router and modem. We decided to just buy the router and modem to avoid the $10/month, knowing that, he gave us a price of roughly around $61/month. Perfect! Today they came to install everything, and excited to come home and settle in after work, I flipped through the channels to find the channels that were promised not available.We immediately called Comcast customer service and they stated that the 'economy plan' that we were apart of did not include the channels we named. We were also informed that we would be paying an extra $10/month for HD, and we DID NOT agree to this! The original sales rep just 'yessed and okayed' everything we asked for and completely misinterpreted the deal to us to get up to buy his product. This is NOT fair. This is NOT ok. Had we known the channels we wanted were not included, we would have never gotten cable. It is not a necessity for us, it is a luxury. The sales rep falsely advertised what he was selling to us. The customer service rep had nothing to say other than she will waive the installation fees. I have read MANY complaints online of people who have gone through the same thing as we have. Comcast sales reps need to be honest and upfront to their consumers!"
"Stacey of Brooklyn Park, MN","Sept. 12, 2016",1,"On several occasions I have had to call Comcast to rectify billing errors. I have been hit by overdraft fees on my bank account because Comcast takes out the payment 24 hours before the due date that is agreed upon. Yesterday I called my bank to state it was vendor error. Since this isn't the 1st time I have had to go to my bank for reversal, I was told that I only get 2 reversals a year and Comcast has done this 5 times. Which cost me $108.00 in overdraft fees. When I call Comcast, after being bounced to 5 customer service reps that have no idea what they are talking about, I get a ""Supervisor"" that is worse than the reps. When asked to speak to superior I am told no one is available. I asked for credit to my bank account and was told we have no way of crediting my bank account with refund. I asked ""why not if you can take it out, you can put it back"". I was offered 2 premium channels and a refund of $15.00 but in 30 days I would have to pay for the premium channels... wtf? I was told that was impossible. I hate that this company is my only choice. I believe that they take advantage of the situation, because there no other options for several people. My townhome association does not allow ""dishes"" so I am stuck. I believe there needs to be a class action suit."
"David of Parkland, FL","Sept. 11, 2016",1,"Our cable went out on Thursday, we were left a note from cable (Comcast) on Fri 5:30 PM to call for appt.

Called us to say they showed up and we were home, no calls to even warn us. We are still on the phone and it's now 5:30 Sunday PM. The worst horrible experience. All we need is a person to fix the box and they know there is a problem and yet they keep rescheduling to no avail. LIVID!!! UNPROFESSIONAL!!! AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE! POOR TV!"
"joe of Mill Valley, CA","Sept. 10, 2016",1,"I have been a Comcast customer for nearly 25 years without too many problems, however that is not true now in 2016. Now it seems they are on a mission to overcharge and deceive at all cost. I recently moved and ordered internet only. I was offered the same 39.99 per month I previously had locked in for one year. My first three bills for May, June and July were correct. In August they hiked me up $20. I complained and a CS rep said they removed the charges and it was back to 39.99 so I paid the bill. Now in Sept I get a bill with no charges removed and a late fee of $9.50 on top of that.When I called the CS dept, all I get is you have to pay the overdue amount before you are allowed to contact billing. I believe this is extortion going on. Why would I pay what is not owed, just so I can speak to them? The second call I was given the number 1-800-934-6484 by them as the billing dept. However upon calling this number, it is a number out of my calling area on the message so it goes nowhere. How can an 800 number in the USA be out of the calling area in the USA??? Really Comcast? I would love for an attorney to email me. The phone sales people lie and apparently this is now the norm for Comcast. CHEAT THE CUSTOMER EVERY WAY YOU CAN and then make yourself unavailable to answer to them.I was also told by CS that they cannot adjust billing. Is that not what Customer Service is for? People call because they need answers to their billing and if you are going to hold them hostage in order to get to billing, SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG WITH COMCAST. There are nearly 5,000 complaints on this site. Why is nothing being done? Why is Comcast still allowed to rip off the public with bogus charges? What good is this site if there are no results? It appears it is just set up to rant and has zero teeth in it to actually punish the offender. I am asked for my order number and I don't know that number so how is it that Consumer Affairs can locate my account with that, when even Comcast cannot seem to find it without numerous repeats of the same questions over and over again SS# etc? I really wish an attorney would get on Comcast for the benefit of all the numerous people complaining here so we could get some results once and for all."
"T of New Market, MD","Sept. 8, 2016",1,"Poor service, overcharged billing and unconcerned customer service. Lip service w/ inaction or follow through."
"Sandra of Dundalk, MD","Sept. 8, 2016",1,I was on hold for so long that I was able to sign up for Verizon. Better price and better package. I would have loved to have kept Comcast but their customer service has been TERRIBLE lately. Switching my grandmother over to Verizon tomorrow as well. I can't do it anymore.
"Susan of Silver Spring, MD","Sept. 7, 2016",1,"Comcast has locked out other competitors in my locality and are total monopoly. They hike prices, send incomprehensible bills and sneak in hazy charges. Internet and TV reception has been progressively getting very bad, lots of freezing, hang ups, it has become unreliable. Their customer service, horrible - half of the reps don't have any idea what they are talking about. I detest the fact that I have no choice and am stuck in a cast literally with - that's right, Comcast! Triple Play with a bill now over $200 per month cause hear this: I can't choose what I want, it has to be ""Bundles"". This is totally unjust. Something should be done to have more competitors come in. I would switch to another in a flash, if it was not an ugly dish!"
"RF of Adamstown, MD","Sept. 7, 2016",1,"I visited Xfinity's Office in Frederick MD on three occasion to resolve chronic service issues & Overcharges. Comcast keeps charging us $40 extra every other month!! On two visits with a staff member, we were assured the overcharge was erased. But it still goes on! Payment due dates was changed without notification which put us in the overdue category! Currently, the overcharge is $65! But Each time I attempt to log on to pay I was not blocked! I had to change my passport just about every other pay period. Today, I was blocked again from login on my comcast account! This is more than frustrating for a Senior with serious Health Issues. Last night I had to take ** to avoid A-Fib. Now we are getting calls from credit collectors! Very Abusive too.I am going to visit xfinity's office for the last time today. It sounds like another Class Action Lawsuit is a must. Further, we live in a neighborhood in which Fiber Optics were NOT extended to us like the new development across the street! Yet, comcast Charges us as if we have FIOS service! Fraud. This situation have not been remedied. Our Friends has higher level of service including HBO and they pay $65 month less than we do. This was brought to Comcast attention every service interruption."
"Brianna of Jacksonville, FL","Sept. 6, 2016",1,"I called in because of a professional install fee (I opted for the self-install) on my bill along with an additional $10 charge I did not understand and should not have been charged for. After waiting over an hour on hold I reached the first rep, said he was from a separate billing company and could not help me. He told me to call the main number again but this time not to input any account info. 2nd attempt I reach another rep who told me the call-in system recognized my phone/account and transferred me to the billing company again. She told me she would transfer me to the correct person, not sure why the first guy didn't think of this? (I would also like to mention each time I spoke to a new person they would ask for all the details on my account before proceeding to tell me they again were the wrong person to talk to.) So I get transferred to rep #3 who sympathizes with my frustration but tells me they are not able to help me either and will transfer. Transfer #4 is finally able to help! Woohoo. 2 hours later and I finally feel like I'm getting somewhere even though my kids are now in major meltdown mode and I'm handing them popsicles telling them ""mommy's almost done"" (fingers crossed!). So we talk for about 30 min. while she tries to explain the charges and changes her story 3 times as I call her out on things that don't make any sense. Finally we are getting somewhere. She says ""I am very sorry I am going to credit the install fee and get this erroneous $10 charge off the account...just let me put you on hold for a minute."" (Famous last words right!) So she puts me on hold and the call promptly drops!! Of course having called Comcast before I've asked her for a call back number or a way to directly reach her in case of this event. Her answer is that they don't have that in place but not to worry, she has my phone number and will call back if the call drops. So I wait...for 30 min. No call back. I call again, now extremely angry although maybe not as much 2 yr old who is trying to scale my body like Mt Everest while screaming at the top of her lungs (maybe the popsicles were a bad idea, although in all fairness I thought the sugar rush would hit after I'd made it off the phone). Rep #5 is not going to mess with this pissed off mommy and agrees to help. Luckily not all of the notes that rep #4 had made were lost so she knew 1/2 of the story and I only had to spend 20 min explaining the other half, which she was able to take care of. So now I have a $60 credit on my next bill and a horrible 3 hours of my life that I will never get back. In short unless you absolutely have to (AT&T doesn't reach here), DO NOT EVER USE COMCAST. You will massively regret the decision at some point."
"Doug of Vero Beach, FL","Sept. 6, 2016",1,"A bigger more complete group of non-caring, lazy, non-knowledgeable group of people couldn't be found on earth. So I tepidly took part of an offer to drop DirecTV. They installed. Within 3 or 4 days one of the boxes (box 1) failed to work as advertised. I called and spoke to a ""tech"". He essentially told me what I was seeing wasn't real. ""The box doesn't work that way"". Then sir, how come box 2 in the other room works the way it was advertised. He kept insisting it doesn't. Send a ""tech"". ""Tech"" arrives and replaces box 1, commenting he hadn't seen one of those boxes before. Several days later box 3 fails. Can't control the tv. Call the tech who again starts arguing with me and essentially tells me to reset the box over and over, which I had done previously a number of times. I hung up on her.Send ""tech"". Tech arrives and says a bunch of connectors are loose. Goes around and with wrench and supposedly tightens all the connectors. Everything fine. Four or 5 days later box 3 fails again. Same thing, can't control tv. Call ""tech"" again. I now believe there is something wrong with the box. ""Tech"" offers to send me a new box / remote. I say, ""Why can't I just go down to the local junkyard err store and get new ones?"" ""You can't do that."" They don't have H/W. I hang up and go down to the local junkyard the next morning and exchange. Ask about my bill which is also screwed up of course. ""We don't do bills here.""Go home install the new H/W and all is OK. All this time I'm sending the salesman e-mails, texts and calling. Ask for some help, an explanation of my bill by 6 pm the next work day or I'm going to cancel, thank god there is a 30 day cancellation policy. He replies finally saying he doesn't know what to do. Really? He gives me his supervisor's e-mail and phone # saying he'll be out of pocket. I write Francine and e-mail, including all the e-mails I've been complaining to Greg about. She replies, can you send me your phone #! Are you telling me this giant company doesn't know my phone #? OK. I send Francine my #. Of course I never hear from her again. The night before I ripped out the junk and returned to the junkyard box 2 fails. How fitting."
"Karen of Dover, DE","Sept. 5, 2016",1,"For two plus years I have been with Comcast now AKA ""Xfinity"" and my service has been so bad. I have been calling and filing a complaints with Comcast due to my service running slow then dropping internet for 30 minutes to 1 hour every day for years. They say it's the modem then it been replaced at least 5 plus times then if it not the modem it the main box. They just replaced it just a couple of months ago. My service has be so bad they have sent service techs out to fix the problem. I still not fix. This is taking time from my daily work schedule. I take off work and lose a day of pay. I've had to take off multiple times over last 2 years.Today, I am online working on something and the internet go out.. it says check internet connection, modem or wires. So, I go pull out the desk and check behind the area everything is working. I then hit the reset button and wait a few minutes. Nothing. It still not working. My home phone is working and never gives me a problem other than I hear what sound like wires rubbing sometimes, but still works. So, I go ahead and call Comcast and work through the steps to reset the internet and 2 minutes later it works. I call to report that I once again am having the same problem for them to be aware of it and try to see if the area is having a problem with a connection. The lady said no there is no report issues.After 2 plus years she can give me a one time credit of $60.00 and that's the most she can do. She will also put in a work order to have some techs check my area. I told her every time it goes out and I do the steps for them to send a signal to reset the modem it works. There's got to be a reason it goes out every day for a 30 minutes to 1 hour. I have had enough of paying such a high bill and my service goes in and out. Someone needs to check to see if this is a problem just here or everywhere and if others are complaining. I do know that my local area has a blog and people who work from home are having the same problem. COMCAST JUST BLOWS US OFF. THEY CHARGE A LOT FOR POOR SERVICE!!! Oh and to make things worse I had to ask multiple times for the work order number before she would give me one."
"Tom of Eugene, OR","Sept. 5, 2016",1,"Dealing with Comcast is like trying to reason with Nazis: it's a waste of time. They just don't care at all, they lie, they are vindictive, they threaten, they are rude, and they take everything they can from you. Perhaps they treat their customers in such an atrocious way because they enjoy a monopoly and are accountable to nobody. We were with Comcast for six years, paying on time each month, but when we moved and our new town didn't offer Comcast, Comcast hit us with a hefty early termination fee, and the nightmare of having to deal with them began.After battling with Comcast for over a month over how much we owed, which varied from nothing to $235.00, depending on which incompetent and deceptive agent spoke with us, we eventually threw in the towel and gave them $75.00 just to make it stop. Having no service and using semaphore or smoke signals is a much better choice than choosing Comcast. With their dishonesty and cold-blooded attitude, the Third Reich could really have put this company to great use. Stay away from them. They are bad news!"
"Luana of Woodbridge, VA","Sept. 4, 2016",1,"After several phone calls begin of May disputing charges due to a mishandling an inaccurate information given by a Comcast representative, they finally tell me that there is a credit in my account. I had just sent a $150 payment and they told me that because it was on the way would be also towards the following month bill. I contact them within to let them know I was moving in a week and everything started changing. I no longer had a credit but I owed money to them. I transfer the service to my new address and had a Comcast member assisting me and was able to straighten up the previous account but my credit and last payment of $150 was not available anymore. Then, I requested the last 6 months of my account statements and was told I would get it in 10 business days. Never got it. Left the country on an emergency trip and upon returning requested it again begin of July. Never got it. About end of July begin of August requested again. Never got it. This evening when I called again inquiring about the statements that I never received I was told that I never gave the new address for it to be mailed here where I reside now. As I repeatedly explain to them in the past, it is a lame excuse, if I move out and closed that account. WHY would I ask them to mail it there??? I was told that in 10 business days I will have it. Really???? This is the 4th time I hear the same regarding these statement. I am yet to see if I will ever get it. Today I received a letter from Comcast that I have an outstanding payment for my existing address, a bill was never received, just ""an important notice"". Apparently they took upon themselves to switch my account to an e-bill without my permission. A payment on the past due amount was sent in by check (which I am researching with the bank on Tuesday, Sept 6th). I am in the customer service industry and never heard so many negative stories as I hear from Comcast including my own client's complaints. After so much frustration with Comcast dishonest practices and excuses I have canceled my service with them."
"Laura of Lascassas, TN","Sept. 3, 2016",1,"I have had Comcast for little over a year. At first my bill was $130, one year later went up to $160. After one year they took away channels, pauses at least once a day to where I have to restart box and as of 2 months ago my bill went up to $200. I called Comcast to find out why it went up again and tech apologized and told me bill would go back to $160. When I paid the $160 I was charged remain balance of $30 on my next bill. I do believe I was lied to because they had no explanation and tech just wanted me off the phone. When I called back again I still was not told why there was a increase but they would not fix my bill. Liars."
"James of Paducah, KY","Sept. 2, 2016",1,"I signed on with Comcast in May 2016, and they assured me there were no hidden fees or costs and that my monthly cost was 54.99 plus taxes for my internet and basic TV. Since then every month my bill has gone up a few dollars at a time and now stands at 85.00. Their latest excuse is because I won't give them access to my bank account for direct deposit they had to increase my monthly charges by 10.00 dollars. It was understood from the beginning that I wanted a paper bill and I was told no problem with that. If this is what has happened in 4 months what happens after a year or 2. This is deceptive billing at its best and I would switch but there are other choices at my location."
"L J of Vancouver, WV","Sept. 2, 2016",3,"My wife and I are senior citizens and we enjoy the Comcast service, however we are getting very tired of getting charges on our statements for services that we did not request or get. The most recent problem, we had many failures of service after recently subscribing to new Comcast service. Finally, a service man came out and determined that the Comcast equipment was failing so he replaced all three modems; no other changes were made (see customer account **, Job #**, Tech #**, date 7/31/16). The following invoice reflected a $70 charge for a residential trouble call. When I called and complained, the charge was dropped. But why was it added in the first place? Maybe I would not notice the charge and just pay it? We also are tired of pestering phone calls, several times a week, suggesting upgrades that we do not want. I finally had to Block all calls from Comcast to stop this constant harassing."
"Cece of Richmond, VA","Sept. 2, 2016",1,"I recently moved to Richmond and wanted to set up services at my new apartment. Initially I was going to switch to Verizon as at my last place Comcast was the only option so I was forced to stick with it despite my unsatisfactory experience with them, this was especially due to the monthly increasing rates while channel options were decreasing which didn't make sense to me. Finally I had cut off the cable and just kept the internet.Because it took me a while to get the contact information for Verizon at my new apartment I decided to call Comcast anyway just to compare pricing. When I called and explained my situation a lady (who essentially became my rep) said she believed she could help reconcile the situation and even give me a better offer so because of this I decided to stay with Comcast. Also because she gave me exceptional service.She set up an appointment for me for Wednesday 8/31/16 because that was when I was moving in and I didn't want to be in my new apartment without being connected at least to the internet. I also explained that that Friday I was having company so she made sure I got an appointment in the right time frame. Because of this I re-arranged my schedule and even requested to leave work early using my PTO hours so that I could be home when the Comcast technician arrived to connect me. He was meant to show up between 5-7 pm. At 6:50 pm I called Comcast to verify my appointment because I had not seen or heard from anyone. The Comcast Customer Service rep informed me that she had put in another ticket (#**) and that the technician had accepted and confirmed that he would be coming to my apartment next. I even left my phone number for them to call me when they arrived because I didn't want to miss them. At this point it was already after 7 pm. I waited until 10:30 pm and still nothing.The next morning I emailed my rep and she did not respond, so I ended up calling Comcast AGAIN! No one had contacted me still. I explained the situation and everyone basically gave me the runaround saying that I now have to wait until the following Tuesday to get hooked up (that is almost a week after my scheduled appointment which was missed due to no fault of mine). I still have not been contacted by ""my rep"" and I am very irritated by this transaction. I feel like Comcast had no regard for me or my time. I essentially used my PTO for nothing because Comcast never showed up and didn't even bother to contact me. Now I'm more upset because I will have to take time off again next Tuesday to accommodate this. Or I can choose not to move forward Comcast, but if I leave this experience will be unforgivable to me because after enticing me with such a good deal I will have to be inconvenienced by setting up services again with someone else AND pay more after having it set in my mind that this is the deal I was going to get. I still have not decided if I want to keep Comcast but I am very appalled and unimpressed by the service."
"helen of Vancouver, WA","Sept. 2, 2016",1,"This is only a tip of the iceberg on this legal cartel, thieves they are. As soon as I get the bill to 0 it comes back at 325.00 for basic TV and internet only!! This is like the 15th time for this, always some reason why. Plus you have to pay them to be able to pay a month ahead, did you know that? Which is bull too. Also of course I got lots of added on goodies I never asked for nor gave my permission for to be added to my bill. Must have ** them off when I switched my phone to CenturyLink. It supposedly broke up the bundle, but they had other bundles, so 320 dollars a month for 2 things?? C'mon. How can a company get away with all of this crap. 8+ years worth of nothing but crap. Every month I have to call about something for years and years straight. Never-ending lies and scams and thievery. In my area they were the only ones available for quite some time without going to sat. So I've had to deal with them. I'm up for a lawsuit. If anyone's with me on this I have so much on these people. Now they need to just admit their sins and pay us all back and for all this stress and time wasted ++. I could really write a book on this company. If you're a lawyer get ahold of me, these people need to be sued!!!"
"Ashishkumar of Princeton, NJ","Sept. 1, 2016",1,Comcast services suck as their Technical support. I had a very low internet speeds from the start and been advised by the Comcast support team to upgrade my speed. I paid more money and took the service but still with same result. I escalated the issue in this February and they provided me 150 Mbps blast which is so bad sometimes my youtube stops steaming and recently it was so bad they could do nothing and internet wont work. The technical support guys gave up and the technician who came to my house gave up and found no fault. I asked the guys to compensate me with higher services for fault for all these days as I never got higher internet speeds which they promised. The answer I get it is they cannot compensate me or get it resolved. This heights of unprofessionalism and business ethics. Stupid guys always cheating the customers with ** stories. I am planning to move to Verizon FiOS.
"tiffany of Philadelphia, PA","Sept. 1, 2016",1,"I literally had the service for three days yes THREE days and ever since then I've been unable to watch cable. Called customer service they sent a signal to the box and the problem to exist. Called back another signal was sent and still NOTHING. They claim they credited my account. A technician was scheduled to come out Tuesday between 3-5 no one ever showed up, but got a call from a tech saying I wasn't home. Mind you I never left home Sat on my couch in front of my wind NO ONE stepped foot on my pavement let alone my porch.Called customer service once again re-scheduled the appointment for the same day between 4-7. Received a call at about 6:00 from a nasty ignorant chick saying my appointment was cancelled and I need to call them back to re-schedule no explanation as to why it was cancelled. Mind you my service is still not working... I'll be cancelling the service and returning their equipment and going with FIOS... Comcast SUCKS big time. Only had the service for THREE days and already had to go through the bull crap..."
"Jody of Austin, TX","Sept. 1, 2016",1,"We were moving to another state and cancelled our service with Comcast. When I returned all of my equipment to the UPS store, I asked the clerk if I had handed in all equipment that they was registered to me. She stated that I had but to ""keep your receipt because they will come back several months from now when you have lost or misplaced the receipt, and say that you had not returned everything, therefore you are not entitled to any refund you might have coming."" She said it had happened many times. Therefore, I made sure and hold on the receipt. My husband called to be sure they had everything accounted for and that were we getting a receipt for services we did not receive since we had cancelled service. The lady at Comcast said, ""Yes, all equipment had been returned and we were entitled to a $117 refund,"" which we would receive in 4-6 weeks.Long story short, it is now 16 weeks later and many many phone calls to see why we have not gotten our refund. There have been all kinds of excuses from, delay in processing the ticket, to just saying we don't know why... I spoke with a supervisor, Dave who assured us the check would be sent out in 5 business days. It has been 3 weeks since that conversation so tonight I called to see what was going on and was told, we did not return all of the equipment!This is a fabrication cut and dry, we have a receipt, which he says was for video equipment only (4 cable boxes). The most TVs we ever had in that house was 3. So the 4 pieces of equipment are actually 3 boxes and the modem. They are saying we did not return the modem so they are going to keep our $117. Exactly what the lady at UPS warned me about is what happened! This is a sorry company, dishonest and ruthless. I would rather not have tv than EVER use this company again. I am contacting a class action lawsuit lawyer tomorrow."
"Diane of Columbia, SC","Aug. 31, 2016",1,"My elderly parents (in their 90's) wanted to switch to Comcast because of service issues with their current provider. When Comcast was scheduled to come out, they had their existing provider service cancelled. Comcast was unable to complete the install. They set up 3 more appointments, each time stating they could not complete the install because there were no lines (I would think they would catch on and have the lines installed by the third time).Due to the severe nature of my parents being without a land line, I called the corporate office. Extremely tough to talk with a live person. Even though the corporate office then scheduled a service call for the install, they arrived at the wrong house, telling me my parents were not home (they described the house and I had to tell them they were at the wrong house), they went back to the correct house and again stated that there were no phone lines!!! In summary my parents who desperately need a land line have been without one for over 3 weeks!!! Nor have they sent anyone else out or called back. They are hopefully and finally getting another provider to come out and install phone lines, but Comcast is a terrible, non-professional and disrespectful service."
"Patrick of Huntley, IL","Aug. 30, 2016",4,"We were having so many dropouts, daily, on our phone and Internet connections over the past 2 months that I made many calls for tech support. We grew tired of constantly unplugging and re-plugging in our modem. It would improve the situation for about 1/2 day, or less. Finally, after calling the Comcast lady (Catherine) at the Abt store, she sent out some repair guys. Three of them showed up (on time) swapped out our modem, and ran a new, orange wire out to the big green box in our backyard. The men, Justin, Eric and Nicholas (a trainee) were all extremely courteous, knowledgeable, friendly and jovial. A great experience, since all is now apparently going fine. Bravo to Comcast for hiring the men and women that they do."
"Neel of Canton, MS","Aug. 30, 2016",1,"Comcast has worst service. We have hotels and every month our property has issue with cable, they could not find issue, and top management is worst. I had an appointment with supervisor. He did not show up. Technician show up, when I asked ""why supervisor is not with you"" he said, ""supervisor is on vacation."" We lost one corporate business account because of cable issue. COMCAST charge our invoice to someone else account and payment was refused so COMCAST call us and said they will suspend our services when. We check our bank side. They never charge to our account. We are going to change our cable company. COMCAST NEEDS TO IMPROVE THEIR SERVICE."
"World of Chicago, IL","Aug. 30, 2016",1,"I've had RCN cable TV, phone, and internet for many years in the past without any kind of problems. After moving out less than one block away from my previous apartment, I HAD TO switch to Comcast since there's no other choice in my current building. It's been little over a year and I'm still struggling with decent internet and bazillion interruptions to TV and phone service. I pay an average of $185/month for TV, internet, and phone service, and I had over 10 technician visits in the last one year, and yet as I write this email, I'm still suffering with the worst internet and TV connection issues.All my electronics were brand new. I bought them last year when I moved into my new place. My Sony 65"" smart TV, Sony sound bar, and Sony DVD player were all the latest ones in the market last year. All those technicians who visited have given me different reasons each time why I've poor connectivity issues. One says the wiring out of my building is bad, while another says my modem/HD box aren't good, TV remote isn't paired well, I need a new router, etc. I even rent my modem and router from Xfinity each month and only use what was set up by them initially. Yet they agree my connections are bad. They could never figure out what's the reason TILL DATE for OVER A YEAR now.They can't fix or troubleshoot over the phone or in person but religiously charge me each month despite knowing the fact that my connections are poor witnessed by their own technicians. One of those technicians ripped apart all my concealed wiring and never placed them back, and another one literally dropped my new sound bar few months ago and broke the panel, and didn't bother to apologize nor give me a credit for it.I pay for the fastest speed 125 mpbs internet Xfinity can offer but their connection is still the WORST... not even 25 mpbs. And not to mention phone tech support is even more ridiculous. I hate how Xfinity functions on monopoly and that's the only way they survive. I don't understand why government doesn't put regulations on these guys and end their monopoly. All I can do right now is wait for my building to have RCN wiring which I believe is finally going to happen soon and I can't wait to switch back to them..."
"Brenda of Jacksonville, AR","Aug. 30, 2016",1,This is one company you do not want to deal with. We got Comcast the middle of July and the first bill came in around the first of August for 200$.That's with no extra charges. There is not one person that I talked to that has not lied to me. Since July I've had my cable shut off twice after agreeing to pay them 103$ on August 31. They were the one that told me to pay that amount not me. Every time I talk to someone they tell me something different. I've asked them to listen to our conversations but they won't. This company has put me through so much crap. It's unbelievable. Like I said there has not been one person that works for Comcast that has not lied to me. If you're looking for a honest and reputable company then Comcast is not the one. Comcast is the most crooked company I have ever met.
"Beth of Pittsburgh, PA","Aug. 29, 2016",1,"I spoke with 6 different agents over many hours across 3 days, all of which were extremely incompetent or flat out liars. They wasted my time and money. If you can avoid Comcast by all means do yourself a favor!"
"bob of Washougal, WA","Aug. 29, 2016",1,"When signing up for Comcast I was told I would receive a 250 visa card, after a couple months called to find out when I would get it. I was told after 90 days if would be sent. I forgot about it and then over 6 months later I called again, was told they had no record, called back and went round and round finally was transferred to and was told I never completed the paperwork. I explained I was told it would just be mailed and they gave me the link. The visa card showed up and I noticed it was not long until it expired so bought a Costco gift card to make sure it was used in full. Recently I got a Enjoy a summer movie on us, tried to use last week to find out it expired on August 22nd. What a dummy I am thinking summer ended in September. Comcast is so over priced but was the only option when I moved to the area, now DirecTV is in the area, think it's time to shop around."
"Simona of Ashburn, VA","Aug. 27, 2016",1,First and last time with Comcast!!! Worse customer service and they load you with hidden fees of all kinds!!! Go with Fios. Trust me!!!
"Khalid of Snellville, GA","Aug. 27, 2016",1,"I have been a Comcast customer for about two years. My service is still the same as it was when I signed up for it. However, my bill never says the same and has been creeping up month after month. Comcast is an unethical company and I wonder there is no goddamn institution that can audit and regulate them. It seems to me our corrupt politicians are part of this on going corruption who gets paid by Comcast to pass law that protect its unethical practices. Comcast literary robs customers and no one can convict this institution. I have files complaint with FCC who simply forward the complaint to Comcast and at the end no resolution. They are all part of a bigger mafia that works against the public interest. We are all sick of it."
"Jennifer of Auburn, GA","Aug. 26, 2016",1,"I have never written a bad review for a company before. However I feel I must share my frustration with Comcast. I have had Comcast service and every house that I have lived in since they started. You have to have cable to watch TV. However since I moved to my new home I have requested my bill to be sent to my personal email on several occasions. However they decided to set up an email for me and create a password for me. The man wrote it on a piece of paper when he came. Not even a whole piece of paper just a scrap piece of paper that you would throw away and left it on the kitchen counter. That was in May. I still have not received the bill and this is August. My services were shut off because I didn't pay the bill that I did not receive. I called customer service starting at 9 a.m. Still have not gotten anyone on the phone by 11:26 a.m.Finally since I was at work I stopped trying and called again when I got home. It took me another hour and 20 minutes to get someone on the phone who could not help me so I called back to ask for a supervisor. When I was told my package deal was for 149 a month but my bill is 297 a month because of service fees, taxes, and Equipment fees. So please tell me how is it that I pay more for renting equipment than I do for the actual service. Why should I have to pay for equipment rental when I'm already paying you monthly for services. Their math makes no sense too. Customer service is non-existent. Worst cable company ever. I have decided to go with another provider since Comcast has no idea what good customer service is."
"Sonya of Ellenwood, GA","Aug. 24, 2016",1,"We have had this service with Comcast after experience bad service and over pricing with ATT, and no matter the company, its payment, pay me, and the service is bad. Service never works as it should, and we have had this issue since day one. Quoted a price, and was bill additional to have better internet service that has never worked, let me say again never worked as it should have. The cable has never been buried, that's going the full length of my yard, and have call every month to have this buried, giving a date and nothing as of this date has be done. Contact Customer service with the issues, and once on hold too long, or after speaking with one person, disconnected and never receive a callback, even when they ask for contact information in the event of disconnection.I only know payment is due once the service is disconnected after I have told the company that the mailing address is not the same as the service address, and still till this day, bills are not coming. I was told that last call in reference to the matter that the statements are online. Okay, online with a service that doesn't work, how does this work? But they have no problem, with turning off service and charging you fees after fee. I deserve all I have paid for this service for the last 5 months and suggest that no one become a customer of this business. I will be filing with everyone that I need to, to have this issue resolve. It's unfair to me and all others that want what they pay for and give what was offered when we call these companies."
"Harinder of Tyrone, GA","Aug. 24, 2016",1,"10 days ago, I called Comcast for a new account at the house I was closing on in a week. Since then I have called them 4 times, but they are unable to create an account for me. This was a model home and the builder had a business account there. In 10 days they haven't been able to figure it out how to convert it to a residence. Twice they have started a ticket and communicated to me that the ticket has been completed and I can go ahead and set up an account. Both times, the sales reps communicated that the ticket was closed out without any action. I had enough of them. Will never deal with them again."
"Charlene of Stuarts Draft, VA","Aug. 23, 2016",1,"I have had COMCAST/XFINITY for just twelve months. The entire time has been a nightmare to say the least. Today, I am out of service completely - TV, Internet, Phone. I have been since Sunday. No one can come until Thursday which means 5 days with NO service. I have called repeatedly. Gone through all the self-help steps. I got a call yesterday that they would expedite my service call. Lady who didn't speak English called me back and said oops we can't come any sooner. I can't see how ALL the technicians in my area of Virginia are busy for 5 days. Unless the service is crap, true. I have had 15 services outages and service calls in 12 months. I have never been given a consideration for days I was out. Instead one time I was charged $70 for the service. Took two days and 6 hours on phone for credit. I have been disconnected without notice. I made a payment arrangement, paid what rep told me too and got turned off.I called back and did chat at same time. It took three hours + to talk to someone. I was told NO ONE there or in the company could change the due date or extend it two days. It was not possible in system. No supervisor or anyone to talk to there. I was turned off for $43.00. Once I paid the $43.00 it came on instantly. I have had service in past with DirecTV, Dish and Shentel. I HAVE NEVER had such poor service. Customer Service or Reception service. I had DISH when the dishes were 8 feet in diameter and you had a little box that prompted it to turn on axis. NEVER any issues. Customer service to this day is excellent. I have the service still in my second home. I had SHELTEL for 4 years and they are small entity. No lack of service.So what the heck is wrong with COMCAST? They have no reps on phone that can help. No technicians that can come repair you and if they do they don't get it right the first time. You hold on phone for hours to be disconnected. You wait for days and service is still poor. I am not sure where these complaints go but I am continuing on to the FCC and BBB. From there maybe the top guys can be alerted to the poor service their company gives. Believe me I would send their stuff back if not for the complex I am in does not allow other services. Good luck people."
"INGRID of Wellington, FL","Aug. 23, 2016",1,"Horrible Services - Over Charge. They also have poor customer service, they just told they go by the notes another agent input in our record.

"!@#$ of Arlington, VA","Aug. 23, 2016",1,"Unbelievably terrible experience for the 10th time. Was on the phone for ** 90 MINUTES trying to transfer my cable from my old apartment to my new apartment in the SAME zipcode. Imbecile on the phone said my apartment was ""unserviceable"" but couldn't explain why. He instructed me to drive during business hours to one of the two ** locations in the entire metropolitan area of Washington DC. When I explained to the guy that ""um no, I have a job and I am moving so I don't have time to go wait in line, especially after I spent 90 minutes on the phone."" He said ""well I don't know what you want me to tell you - it's likely that this is because the previous tenant in your building may not have paid their bill""... like why the ** is that my problem? I don't even live there yet!! THE WORST."
"Demeterius of Jacksonville, FL","Aug. 23, 2016",1,"I'm writing this letter in disappointment and disbelief as to how my issues were not resolved as of being on the phone for exactly an hour forty two mins and thirty five seconds trying to get this matter addressed. The issue began 8-19-2016 when there was an outage in my area causing both of my boxes to go out in my home. I contacted an agent and the boxes were not able to be restored so I was instructed to go into the store to have them replaced on Saturday morning. Fine, I did just that. Saturday, I came home and connected the boxes and they were working fine until all of a sudden the main box begin to reboot on its own and it continued this through out the night, but I decided to wait and see if it stop and it didn't.Therefore, Sunday morning 8-21-16 I contacted Comcast and spoke with Daniel around 10:00 am to troubleshoot and it still did not fix the problem. Next, I called again and spoke with Raphael then he transferred me to Fabion who then transferred me to Amber who did the same thing and we thought it was fixed and then I asked to be transferred to billing to see if there would be any compensation for the frustration and inconvenience that has been cause within the last three days. To no avail the problem has still not been resolved.At this time, I was connected with Eve in the billing department who, was taking her time at first, but for some strange reason continued to put me on hold and when I requested a Supervisor she stated no one was available. By this time, I'm furious and I need you all to feel my frustration. I had been on call for my job (8-20-21) from 5 pm-8 am and having to come home to my daughter upset because the television continue to go in and out by rebooting is just ridiculous. I have lost total trust and patience in this company as a whole. I am not looking for a discount even though when I asked for an adjustment in my billing Eva stated she could only do $8.04. At this time my problem had not been resolved and she continued to giggle as if something was funny. Now, since the billing request was not respected I asked to be transferred back to someone who could help see why the box is continuously rebooting and I was connected with Marisa who was patient and saw how rude Eva was because she did not transfer the call correctly by even telling her my name. (Please review all recordings). Needless to say, the problem has yet to be resolved. The box is still rebooting and no one seems to care. Signed a very frustrated customer."
"Cynthia of Everett, WA","Aug. 22, 2016",1,"I am in my third year of dealing with Comcast's deceit and barely legal business practices. In 2014 I wanted to leave Comcast for its poor performance both technically and customer support. I called them and asked if there would be any contract charges to cancel my account at which time they answered no. I asked them to confirm their answer and once again was told there would be no contract charges to cancel my account. I asked for the customer service rep's name and was told Kit and only Kit although I asked for further identification.When I actually cancelled my account they informed me that there was a $90 contract charge to cancel and thus began the three year headache. I attempted to resolve this via email with no response. I attempted to resolve this via customer service only to be told my option was to resume as a Comcast customer. I asked to speak to a supervisor only to be dumped into a voice mailbox with no return call. I asked for assistance by a Comcast salesperson with the company I work for with no follow thru.I paid all charges but the $90 and let that go to collections. I wrote letters to the collection company disputing the charge only to have it keep turning up like a bad penny. I finally settled today for less than the full $90 but have little hope that they will not turn up again seeking to collect the remainder. I was informed by this collection agency that Comcast is attempting to refresh its customer service image due to all the negative press. Personally I think they have failed miserably as a company with abysmal customer service. I would go completely off grid if my only choice for service was Comcast. If you have an option choose anything other than Comcast. They are crooks, then and now."
"Age of Aurora, CO","Aug. 21, 2016",1,"I cannot wait until my contract is over. I will not go back to this company again. Very rude customer service, the charge outrageous, and they would not help me or explain why my bill is so high. I am so disgusted with this company."
"Tammy of Washington, NJ","Aug. 21, 2016",1,"I have only been with Comcast for 17 months. I started with a promotional rate and then all at once my rate doubled and my service dropped. Today I had the rep count all the times in my account that I have had to call in to troubleshoot issues and/or have service techs come out and in the last year I have had 7 (and that does not include the 2 times I drove out to the service center to exchange equipment). In 17 months I have had 3 modem/router boxes and now I am told that I will need a new converter box. Some reps have been good and helpful. Other reps...not so much! The service itself and the equipment have been terrible! I have had more issues in one year with Comcast than I have had with every other company I have ever done business with added together! And the worst part is that a few different reps have told me that I need to pay more to get my equipment to work or to have techs come out. WHAT?!? So, let me get this straight... I pay for a service and I pay extra for equipment, but that service and equipment breaks so I have to pay even more to get it fixed!!! I already paid for it and it didn't work, so why the hell would you think I will want to pay even more to get it to work. I am a loyal person and I do not like changing companies or doing paperwork, but the next issue I have with Comcast I am leaving. I do not care if I have to pay a little more for service with another company as long as I know that what I am paying for will actually work when I want it to. My advice to you is find another company... unless you have time to sit around on the phone with customer service and wait for service techs to come, and if you don't mind missing the big game or Olympic gold medal events or whatever else you are hoping to watch. P.S. The only reason I gave this a one star review was because it wouldn't let me give it a zero."
"Ron of Deer Park, TX","Aug. 21, 2016",1,"I have had Comcast for years and paid them for internet, phone, and premium, cable for 5 rooms. Therefore, I have been paying thousands a year. They always had poor service. But I think the last straw was when I had an internet problem involving security. They allowed a bug through that crashed my computer and tried to charge me close to 200 dollars a year for a contract for 3 years. I hung up, reloaded Windows 10 and then worked for several hours to get all my non-Windows programs up and running. In the past when such an event happened, Norton worked with you to fix it free of charge.They are now using some foreign subcontractor to handle security issues and they logged me into a logmein package that killed my PC {what was left of it} and I could not do anything. Then they tried to sell me their package and I did not find out my PC was completely out until I pulled the rip cord and exited their security. Now I am rethinking how bad I need cable and their phone service as well as internet. I am checking out the cost of my different options and will be making a definite choice this week. I just remembered after the hurricane hit seven years ago, the last thing I got back was cable and phone and internet. Another good reason to quit."
"Kyle of Colorado Springs, CO","Aug. 20, 2016",1,"Comcast is a SELLOUT! Half the time you're speaking with some hee-bob across the seas. After being a customer for over 3 years, I had some things go not my way and had to cancel. They REFUSED to work with me on my final balance, charged me $20/month for 12 months & $30+ in taxes from who knows what that all added to over $280. I agreed to the balance & I asked if I could break the payment up into 2 payments because I did not have all the funds. They responded with, ""You have 20 days to pay the balance or we automatically charge you"". I then asked to speak with a supervisor that told me, since I was cancelling their service, they could not help me. They advised me to pay for a $19.99/month plan + $12 for receiver rental to avoid paying the 275$ lol. What the **? I cancelled my card solely for the point of the matter. They won't get a dime. These people are piss poor in customer service & could care less about anything you have to say unless you have $$ for them. There is NO way to get in contact to someone in the upper echelon, there are no places to submit a complaint of that sort, except on a couple online reviews, nobody directly with Comcast. Only kept referring me to the ''legal department'', such **. When you tell a customer who has paid you EVERY month for 3 years that nobody can help you, this is the final judgement, who the hell are you? What happened to America? What happened to customer service? Where have people moral compass gone? So farewell and ** you to Comcast, every single person I run into with Comcast I will convince them to switch & go somewhere else, nobody wants to be a part of your middle east shenanigans anyways. Their slogan should be BAIT & SWITCH. Can't keep ** people over, eventually it'll be the wrong person & it will be YOUR bad."
"Rebecca of Rincon, GA","Aug. 20, 2016",1,"I tried to sign up for Comcast service when I moved into my new apartment. Really, I tried three times. I signed up online for a package and was told that the equipment would be shipped to me. It never arrived, so I called a week later to be told that it had now been shipped and would arrive in days. I called again a week later to be told that NOW it would be shipped. I finally called a fourth time, still after receiving no equipment but after receiving a bill for $72, and was told it had never shipped. I asked them to cancel my account.I then received a bill for over $312 and numerous phone calls demanding I return the equipment, which of course I did not have. I finally wrote an email to the collection agency (yes, they turned in over in less than 30 days) demanding that they cease and desist--I never heard from them again. I also notified Comcast by phone and was assured once again that the bill was zeroed and that I would be receiving a zero bill soon. In the meantime, my husband went on the Comcast forum and discussed the situation with a rep there, who also assured us that he had personally seen to it that the bill was zeroed.This morning, I went to the local Comcast office because I have not received a zero bill in the mail so I have nothing in writing. I was told that the person or people who handle billing were not available today. I asked for a balance on my bill and was told it was $41. I then tried to call the 800 number for a record-breaking 7th time. I received a young woman who barely spoke English. I asked to be transferred to the United States. She transferred me to the Philippines. I asked again to be transferred to the United States and was told no. I asked if she was refusing to transfer me to the US and she said, ""Yes."" I terminated the call. At this point, I am not sure what to do. The only reason I am giving a one-star review is because you cannot give no-star reviews."
"Stefanie of Madison Heights, MI","Aug. 19, 2016",1,"First, a door to door representative from their company told me he could get me a lower rate without a contract, last summer. The next time I viewed my bill it was more expensive than my current plan and I was now locked into a two year contract. I was never able to get the low rate I had back. Then, they just upped my bill without notice by over $60 and are saying my promotion ended. I'm not sure how that is possible because the door to door guy was at my house less than a year ago and my costs went up then. I would not even rate them 1 star."
"keli of Washington, DC","Aug. 17, 2016",1,"Yet again I've experienced horrible Comcast customer service. (again and again and again) I was online with a very helpful tech for 2 hours trying to resolve an issue (got bounced to several people and finally ended up with the helpful tech) and the chat got disconnected. I told him/her that my computer gave me a signal that the chat would disconnect if I did what they wanted me to do. They said no they would not be disconnected, but yes they were. They were given a phone number when the chat started but no call and I have no way to contact the tech which means I have to start the discussion all over with a new person. You would think given the fact that I said i think I might lose you they would have called me on the number they were given. I'm trying to connect online to watch the Olympics. Guess that's not going to happen. Because I don't have 2 hours to start over. I was trying to watch people I actually know compete. As usual you can't count on Comcast. I have no choice but to use them in DC, so they don't have to provide any service."
"Deborah of Chicago, IL","Aug. 16, 2016",1,"Has anyone else had this experience? I took off work early to wait for Comcast after three days with no Internet or Cable. Two of us were in the house with phones all around. Comcast was supposed to arrive between 5 and 7. I called Mom on home phone at 4:57 to say I was three minutes away. The phone worked fine. The Comcast repairman did not arrive at all. When we called, they claimed the dispatch center called at 5:20 p.m. There is no record of that call on our phone but very oddly, when we checked, we found that the phone line that worked fine at 4:57 was down. We called AT&T and they reset it.Is it possible the repair man deactivated the phone line (which is easily accessible) to avoid making a service call? We have a hard time grasping the coincidence that the line was temporarily off at the very time he was scheduled to arrive and very easily was reactivated after he left. Not accusing. Just asking if anyone else had this experience."
"Andrew of Lockport, IL","Aug. 16, 2016",1,Where do I start. Well I recently canceled my service about a month ago and was told I owed a bill of 515 so I made a payment of 250 brought my bill down to 265 so then I canceled so I told the rep being that I canceled am I getting my credit for the month in advance that I pay. He said yes. Well to my disbelief I received a new bill for 367. Even after I canceled. Ladies and gentlemen be aware comcast are rip off artist. If you cancel they will charge you for canceling. Get another provider if you can. It took me about 3 years of service before I realized how much rip offs they were. CANCEL YOUR SERVICE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE...

"k. of Petaluma, CA","Aug. 15, 2016",1,"I had originally contacted Comcast to downgrade my internet because it shot up from $50 a month to $93! I had just lost my job and was explaining how I either need to downgrade or get a better deal or just find another provider that offered a better deal. Which is when the agent offered me a great deal for $114 a month plus taxes and fees, which he assured me numerous times would be less than 125 a month, plus several other extras included in the deal. Because of this I had paid the $250 cancelation fee to DirecTV to move my cable services over. When I received my cable boxes, unbeknownst to me, a tech should have come out to switch the outside cables to Comcast, however, even after asking if that is what needed to happen I was assured it would not! So after setting up my cable boxes they obviously didn't work. After calling customer service, the incompetent rep decided to just send me two new boxes, instead of running trouble shooting on mine, and also told me nothing needed to be done even though I just disconnected DirecTV. These other two boxes arrived, although I told her I was only having issues with the one because I couldn't set up the other box until the first was set up. Of course all of these boxes still did not work. So I decided to go online and chat with a rep, where I discovered my $114 bill I had agreed upon was now $279!! This woman charged me for $50 shipment fee and added these other boxes onto my account as if I had ordered more boxes when she told me she was sending one replacement box free of charge! So within a matter of less than a week I had spent over 20 hours on the phone and on chat with Comcast to get this billing issue resolved! Instead, I was passed around from one department to the next, all of whom ""didn't have the authority to honor my contract I have in writing"" which mind you is a legally binding contract, and on top of that received nothing but disrespect telling me I was wrong and I had signed up for this huge bill and fees and was responsible for paying it! And when I argued and asked them to look up the chat when I had signed up and my agreement should be honored, again I was either sent to another department or flat-out hung up on! So I decided to do a chat again because I can save these chats and have the information in writing should a dispute come up again. I had asked if I could email my chat with the offer I had signed up for and they told me no! Again, I was disrespected and sent to several different departments, who again told me they do not have the authority to honor the contract I signed up for. Mind you, I am single mother, which had let them know, I have just lost my job, do not have (as I'm sure NO ONE does) 4 plus hours a day to clean up these messes and issues and wrongful billing issues that Comcast employees have created!!! I have been up nearly every night till over 2 am trying to get this figured out... and that not including the calls I have made during business hours. To make matters worse, I had to go through the same song and dance and bs same script they all gave me from every single department where no one apparently has any type of authority to do anything! Total bs! When I requested to cancel because it is still within my 30 day right of rescission... My internet was conveniently disconnected... Coincidental... Definitely NOT! Especially since it happened every single time they didn't want to discuss cancellation or let me speak to someone in charge! Such a complete waste of time that I don't even have, that I need to be looking for a job to support my child, to even pay for this damn service that they keep screwing up and not ""authorized"" to fix. I feel like they are trained to just pass you around until your 30 days to cancel is up... Seems pretty illegal to me, and changing someone's contract and adding extra costs to it... Pretty sure is also illegal! The fact that I have spent hours upon hours trying to just have my contract honored, or even speak to someone that can cancel this plan for me just to be disrespected, hung up on, passed around and then to disconnect my internet because you don't want to deal with me? Sounds pretty shady and again seems like it's more than likely to offer a cancellation period and prevent a customer from canceling! Pretty sure I am just one of thousands Comcast has done this to and if there is a lawyer out there looking to start a class action suit and other victims of Comcast's shady business practices then I say we fight back for our rights and our money they are basically stealing from our pockets! I would also like a real internet expert to come check the speed of my ""Blast"" package I pay extra for because I'm pretty sure the Comcast speed test is just some sort of scam, there is no way when I run their test and it says I have 250 Mbps that a browser would take as long as dial up to load! And in fact I only got Comcast because you needed faster speeds to make DirecTV OnDemand work since it is streamed through the internet and yet my 250 Mbps that would run on the Comcast speed test worked just as horribly, if not worse than the 25 Mbps I had with AT&T!!!Someone other than a Comcast employee needs to check the real speeds offered! All of this seems like one huge scam! And if this going to be disputed I have records, which clearly Comcast does not keep these records of calls or chats as I was told I had only one chat on record, yet somehow I have several I have saved! Extremely shady and I wouldn't be surprised if someone were to dig further there would be more illegal practices found! I will be making this complaint with the BBB as well! And I suggest others do too!"
"David of Homer City, PA","Aug. 14, 2016",1,"I have been a Comcast customer since 1975 (formerly Highland Video before acquisition). My monthly pricing seemed to steadily increase until I finally called to ask for an explanation. After getting nowhere with their customer service, and continually trying to stop them from trying to upgrade me, I finally told them to simply give me the same basic deal that they advertise on TV. Basic cable, internet and phone (Triple Play). The ""Basic packageŠ—. I was told that my internet would slow down, I could no longer make long distance phone calls and I would receive a lot less channels for which I replied ""FINE"". I was then told that I would have to turn in my HD equipment, then the representative hesitated and said ""oh never mind, you don't have HD equipment"". It didn't register at the time, until I printed out all of my past statements and noticed an alarming trend. Somewhere along the line, someone from Comcast entered data that placed me into the HD category. I do not own HD TV's. I started looking at my bills and noticed that for years I was bring charged $170.49 per month for HD Preferred Service. Once I called to seek an explanation for the constant increases, I was placed in the ""basic"" package for $92.95 per month for which I have been paying since. The overcharges were in my mind intentional. Being a Senior Citizen, I am very angry and wonder just how many other people are overcharged for services not rendered. I feel that several thousand dollars in Š—“overchargesŠ— have been sent to Comcast in a timely fashion, never late, always on time. For being a loyal customer, I get the short end of the stick. I am contacting the BBB and also the FCC."
"dolores of Hollywood, FL","Aug. 14, 2016",1,"On 6/3/16 I spoke to Rosemarie. She gave me a promotional rate of $29.99 that would be good until 3/2017. My June bill reflected that price. My July bill was $41.28. I called to check the bill and spoke to a very nice rep. Havran but he was unable to correct the bill. He got his manager Frank extremely rude and told me the reason the bill was higher was because I needed to have Eco billing which is paperless and auto pay. I told him I was never told this by Rosemarie and my neighbor has the same plan and he doesn't have direct auto pay. He said he would give me $10.00 toward my TV account and I said I don't want anything towards that as I get free cable from my maintenance payments through my condo.Is it standard procedure that you must have direct payments in order to get a promo? Then if so why didn't my two last bills say ""you are being charged $10.00 more because you don't have direct payments."" When I asked Frank this question he said that they don't have to give a reason. He gave me 30 days to decide whether I want them to automatically charge my account each month. I told him I am okay with not getting paper bills but not with allowing them to automatically charge me as their bills are always unclear. I would appreciate your input. I noticed many complaints about Comcast billing and I am concerned that they are getting away with it. Thank You."

I had to make yet another call today because they screwed up the bill. This is the 11th call I've had to make because of problems with billing, equipment, service etc. and I waited on hold for a supervisor today for 1 1/2 hours. Typical, and aggravating. I calculate I've spent over 14 hours on the phone with them in 30 days.Between the 7 HOUR INSTALL (not exaggerating!) because the tech was incompetent, to the promised call backs I never got, to the cable not being buried for 3 weeks (c'mon it's mowing season!), then the company no-showed, to the numerous phone reps (including managers) who promised credits and to clean up the billing issue but never did, and a special thanks to the rep who doubled charged my bill instead of crediting it.

A few months back, I called to see what it would cost to add STARS onto my account. The representative on the phone told me that it would only increase my TOTAL bill another $3 a month. I thought this was a great deal, and asked SEVERAL times, ""How much my total cost would be?"" Each time I was told it would only increase my total bill $3. When I finally look at the bill two months later, it's gone up over $25. So I called customer service and spent an hour on the phone. After getting nowhere, except a non-working phone number to a supervisor, I called back for a 4th time. This time I spoke with the first level customer service agent, who told me she could adjust my bill to the amount I was quoted. Now when I am getting ready to go to bed, I go upstairs and my cable box says ""not authorized for use"" so I had to call again and spend more time on the phone. I was given a reference number in case I had any problems. I have them the reference number and they told me that they had taken the $9.95 charge for the extra box off my account. And I had to pay for it to be turned back in. Another 20 minutes on the phone I spoke with someone whom I gave the reference number to and they kept telling be about my plan. Nothing about the price adjustment I was promised and supposed to clear up with my reference number. So they turned my box back on and gave me a credit of $10 for 12 months. Now, if I have the service longer than 12 months, I'm screwed. And as I type this, my box isn't even working. This is the worst service I've experienced. Ever. As soon as I can I will be trying to look for another option. All I've been given is lies and the runaround. Your company told me one thing, and did another, THREE TIMES. How can you stay in business when your employees are committing fraud by putting me into packages that I never agreed to, then telling me my bill would only go up $3 when it was close to ten times that amount?My reference number is **. Spent over two hours on the phone to get what I was quoted by your company, and even after they tried to fix it, they still screwed me. And I had to spend more time to fix your problems. I was recruited by a headhunter to work for your company because I specialize in customer service. In many industries. And I can tell you that if you were a retail store, and people had the choice to drive further to reach another store, you would be out of business. But since your the only option for some people, you seem to think that treating them fair and honest doesn't matter. If I was managing a small part of your customer service, I could turn it around in a week. Easy, be honest. Don't argue with customers who have a legitimate complaint and tell them about the plan they have. Listen to them, and fix their problems. Now, I'm guessing I'll be forced to call every month to get my bill fixed because no one there seems to know how to do anything or explain what they did. I was told that $20 was taken off my bill, but they didn't tell me that they took off the charge for my extra box and that it wouldn't be working. Or that if need to spend a half hour to get less than what they told me just so my box could be turned on. I will be posting this on every website I can to warn potential customers about how your company works and treats its customers. Something needs to be fixed. Fast."
"Ashley of Mobile, AL","Aug. 11, 2016",1,"I called Comcast to set up a payment to be withdrawn out of my account on 8/5/2016 and they did not take the money out my payment was for 462. On 08/11/2016 my service was cut off. I then called to speak to a manager. They told me they would have to call me back with it. Have yet to get a callback. It is now 6pm. I did call Comcast back at 4pm and ask them why the money was not take out that I had set up for 3 weeks. The guy proceeds to tell me due to the fact that it was NSF which that was incorrect because I have the money sitting in my account from the 25th waiting on them to take it out and like I informed him this is happened on three different occasions and it makes no sense that I have to keep going through this so I need to know how to return the equipment. And he said to me ""I don't understand why you want to return the equipment. Is there something that we can do? And I said ""No this has happened to many times."" And he said ""Well I don't know what happened."" Like I explained to him ""Hey"" I told him ""There was probably a glitch in your system cause I know it's not a problem on my end. The money is there. I'm looking at it and you'll have a very poor customer service. I've still been waiting on a manager to call me back and they have failed to do so."" So with that being said I have cancel their service and I am moving to another service provider because I can no longer deal with Comcast. Every time I turn around they are overcharging for different things and I think they do it on purpose just so they can get that reconnection fee."
"Rob of Littlestown, PA","Aug. 11, 2016",1,"This company is appalling. The representatives lie to customers everyday about billing and services they will receive then charge them something completely different on their next billing cycle (evidence below). If that isn't bad enough, they go a step further and berate their OWN customers. My experience: my fiance and myself sign up for double play, two-year contract, and terminate early. We were moving out of our apartment and in with my family, who already has Xfinity, in order to prepare for some future purchases. Upon talking to a representative I am quoted $84.19 for terminating. No problem, except my bill comes in shortly after at 129.01. We call the billing department to see what the issue is and we are met with hostility and resistance. We are then put on hold and shortly later another rep from billing answers and I have to explain what is going on again with the bill. They are generally rude and when I ask for their name, they REFUSE to give it to me. The conversation ends with her saying quote, ""the bill is the bill and [she] was tired of people trying to to cancel service and not pay their bills."" I was HUNG UP ON. I can state right now, I have paid and would be happy to post every paid statement for their lackluster trash called ""service"". This is how Xfinity handles themselves and it pains me to think I went with them just because most of my family and fiance's family has them. After this experience I will never have anything positive to say and will encourage both families to switch to another service, along with anyone that will listen. I can tolerate the lies, and the shoddy equipment, but I will not be disrespected for asking a question. Do yourself a favor and go with any other service or beat your head with a brick when you get bored. Both are better options than Xfinity."
"Donald of Franklin, NC","Aug. 11, 2016",1,"After living in Western North Carolina for 3 years having moved from Stuart, FL I bought a condo in Jensen Beach and was forced into Comcast due to the association's contract with them. NIGHTMARE! The worst customer service and product imaginable. They lost my account somehow, billed me twice for the same time frame, billed me when I was on vacation hold, made harassing phone calls to me for payment. All this in spite of me taking 2 hours 20 minutes in line with documents proving my case they Comcast still sent my account to collection. Thankfully I sent the collection agency my documentation and they dropped it. Case over? Not with frigging Comcast. They sent it to a second collection agency with the same results in my favor. Could I or can I file a suit against them? And their services SUCK. Their DVR has enough recording space for maybe 10 hours. If I recall with DISH I have hundreds of hours. Stay away from Comcast if at all possible. I sold the condo just so I wouldn't to deal with them any longer."
"Tom of Rochester Hills, MI","Aug. 11, 2016",1,"Comcast has the worst customer service that I have ever had to deal with. Four years ago I had Comcast installed at my home, I immediately started having issues. After calling service and having several different technicians attempt to repair the problems I finally had it disconnected. I thought that after they installed new cable in my neighborhood that I would try Xfinity again and set up an installation appointment. To my surprise (sarcasm) nobody showed up or called. I called to be told that I still had a balance from the last time, but nobody ever notified me of this. I will never give Comcast the opportunity to be my provider again."
"Andy of Peachtree City, GA","Aug. 10, 2016",1,"I've just moved here from NYC where for 18 years I had the distinct pleasure of having Verizon provide me with internet service. I would say that in those 18 years I might have been down maybe 24 hours in total. With good old Comcast, I have had outages lasting up to 6 hours and there have been at least 3 of them. At other times, service has dropped out for anywhere between a minute and 2 hours. In other words, Comcast has beat Verizon - in the space of 35 days no less - in unreliable internet connectivity. I hope that they get a big old plaque or something for this. Because I really know where I'd like it to be 'hung' as it were. Oh, and just one final cherry on this crappy little Sunday. Whenever I call to complain, the agents always manage to make it my fault somehow."
"raymond of Philadelphia, PA","Aug. 10, 2016",1,I close my services - no good. Ask for my balance. Wait 2 or 3 weeks for my balance. I make the payment. Check my credit report and they have me in collection for not making my payment. Balance unpaid. So who get my money. They make you feel bad on your credit report. I will report this.
"Judith of Aurora, CO","Aug. 10, 2016",1,"I have had Comcast Triple Play for many years and have enjoyed it tremendously. I love the cable package I have and my Internet speed is very good. I recommended Comcast to friends and family over the years. Until now. On Friday my phone went dead and my modem lights continuously flashed. Cable and Internet were fine. But no dial tone. I called Comcast and spoke to India. The agent recognized that my modem was broken and put in a request to have a new modem sent to me. He said the phone showed ""active"" on his end so he deduced it was a modem issue. He did not say anything about dispatching a tech. He restarted my old modem 3 times in an effort to give me dial tone, but to no avail.I called the next day to request a tech be dispatched with a new modem. I was speaking to India again. This agent restarted my modem at least 4 times (I think they must get a bonus for every time they do a restart!!). He had the ticket in front of him and I stress that while the phone looked ""active"" to him, it was not. There was no dial tone. However, you could leave voicemails since that system resided elsewhere. He would not dispatch a tech. On Sunday I called the ""repair team"" whose number had been provided by the Saturday agent. They (in India or Philippines) read the ticket and insisted on restarting my modem. This time 3 times. They said the new modem was arriving on Monday and asked me to call them when it arrived.Sunday evening I received a voicemail from the repair team. My phone service was fixed! Of course, it was not. On Monday I set up a chat to say the modem had not arrived and I needed a tech. I was told a tech could be scheduled 1.5 weeks away. The ""chat"" tech said my ticket had been closed because the phone was fixed. And there was no record of a modem being mailed. I was almost to the point of tears. EVERY number I called led to an overseas call center who was TONE DEAF.On Tuesday I planned on going to my local Xfinity store and raising hell... when a new modem arrived. I called the repair team and got the Philippines. I could barely understand her. The accent was very thick. She insisted on restarting my modem before she scheduled a tech. And, of course, to no avail. But she opened a NEW ticket for me. Then fortunately we got cut off. I called back and made an error in my selection and miraculously got a US call center. This agent, Keisha, was fabulous and took action immediately and escalated the dispatching of a tech. I'm now waiting for dispatch to call me with the schedule.However... about 2 hours after setting things up with Keisha, I received a voicemail from the repair team that my phone was fixed. Of course it was not. I called and touch-toned the same way as before and got a US call center again! And the agent flagged the ticket ""DO NOT CLOSE THIS TICKET."" for fear the repair team would, again, close my ticket. What can I say. USA, USA, USA!! I am a former call center manager and director and I'm appalled at the total lack of training and lack of authority given to these outsourced agents. They are nothing short of robots. Comcast does not deserve to expand. It was right they were denied Time Warner."
"Weslianne of South Salt Lake, UT","Aug. 9, 2016",1,"I would only recommend Xfinity to my worst enemy. My bill started at about $100.00 a month, jumped to $120.00 and is now $150.00 after being a customer for two years. They add things on and change things ALL THE TIME without notification. So, I am paying $150.00 a month for BASIC channels, Wi-Fi and a home phone line that I do not use. One time, I had scheduled an automatic payment and totally forgot about it (my mistake). I called that day to make the payment. No one bothered to make sure I wanted to make a double payment because I had already had one pending. I requested one of the payments be refunded because only one was due. I was told three times that I would be seeing it 5-7 business days. (After being hung up on twice while requesting a supervisor) I finally called and reached a supervisor by the time my next bill was already due and she had advised me that it can not be refunded and she has no idea why I was told it could be. Not to mention no one ever knows what they are talking about when it comes to inquiries on my account! Worst company to go through."
"Lisa of Edgewater, MD","Aug. 9, 2016",1,"My horrific experience started this past January, when I signed up for Comcast. I scheduled an installment, but when the gentleman arrived, He said that he would have to have a line dropped to the house in order to give me the whole package that I was paying for. He did set me up for basic cable, but I was paying for On Demand, and all of the movie channels, the internet and a phone, all of which were not working. He said that they would have to have a surveyor come out and mark, and then someone would have to drop the wire, and THEN, I would have to call them to set up ANOTHER appointment for them to come out and finish the install. It sounded like a lot of inconvenience on my part and taking off another half vacation day at work, but I really didn't see a choice.Three weeks later nothing had been done!! In the meantime, I had to have Verizon come and install temporary internet. They also had to drop a wire, which was completed that day! After more calls than I can count with people who didn't have any correct information, and 5 weeks total, I finally got them to finish the job. In the meantime I had already received two bills for the full contract. I tried to explain to the billing department, but the whole thing was either too complicated for them, or they simply didn't care.About a month later, my cable went out, for no reason. I spent over an hour on the phone with some tech guy, who couldn't accomplish anything, and had to make an appointment for someone to come out. They couldn't accommodate my work schedule, so I had to make arrangements to take another half day off. When the guy showed up, he told me that the equipment that had been installed was old equipment, and could not accommodate the up-to-date system. HUH??? A vacation day wasted, two months, and I actually had what I had ordered. That was April.In July, I returned home from a trip to find the cable, internet, and phone all out. I called customer service, and was on for another hour while he tried to send signals. He finally said that they would have to come out. I explained that I didn't have any more time off of work and I would need an evening appointment. He told me that they don't provide that. Three days later, I finally, got a friend to wait for them. When they showed up, they determined the problem was in a box underground, and that they would have to send a field tech. Surprisingly, they were able to solve the issue and found that a connector had blown in the underground box. Great!Two days later everything went out again. I called, yet again, and spent half an hour trying to explain to the tech guy, that there wasn't a problem in the box. He also said that he couldn't get me an evening appointment, but did tell me that they do provide evening appointments. I scheduled an appointment a week out, in order to get an evening appointment. Yesterday was that appointment. I got a call from the tech asking me if he could show up at 2:30 instead because I was his last call. I explained that I was at work.When he did show up at 5pm, I was unfortunately caught in traffic and arrived at 5:04 for a 5-7 appointment. Triwire Engineering Solutions truck was parked on the street in front of my house. The first thing I saw when I walked around the back of my house looking for the tech, was one of them urinating on my tree! The appointment went down from there. They didn't know what they were doing, and after restarting my box, and nothing happening, they told me that they really couldn't help me, and that I should call Comcast! What??? I told them that was who I called, and they said that they were just contractors. I told them that they could not leave until they had, at least set up a plan to get me back up and running.During the next two and a half hours, the lead guy told me that I was the problem, and the trainee with him told me that Comcast has the worst customer service, and that the plan being put in place by their supervisor was ""ridiculous and stupid."" When I went inside the house for a second, they jumped in their truck, and took off. I had to call Comcast again, and set up an appointment for a field tech, one more time. This time I, apparently, don't have to be home, and he is supposedly there right now fixing the problem.Where are the people running this company? Are they too busy to provide a product and service that they are charging ridiculous prices for? How do they stay in business? As soon as I can, I will be switching companies, but I need more vacation time first, and enough time to talk to their billing department about the contract they hooked me into!"
"Kerry of Los Angeles, CA","Aug. 8, 2016",1,"I had an appointment for 8/6/2017. On the night of 8/4/2016 I was online making sure my bill was auto paid and noticed that the web site said that I did not have any appointments. I called customer service and was told that I would need to wait until Wednesday 8/10/2016 for the soonest appointment. I made it pretty clear that I really needed the internet service turned on since it is my job to make sure that Opticsplanet.com and several other high voulume retail sites stay on line and that it is imperative that I have the ability to VPN into our offices. I also made it clear that I would rather not take time off from work since I had just done so to complete my move. After a couple more calls I finally was moved to an appointment between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm on Tuesday 8/9/2016 which is a 12 hour window that would cause me to be out of work for an entire day not to mention that the communities office is closed until 9:00 am making it impossible for a technician to turn on the cable since they would have no access to the communications room if they arrive at 8:00 am. I finally got an escalation ticket and was contacted by a gentleman who told me that he would have someone here on Saturday or today yet nobody ever called or showed up after that. I was also told that I could perform a self move and that the equipment would work which was an outright lie. Additionally the first rep I spoke to said that they would touch base with me on Saturday to make sure the equipment move went well and that too was a lie. On top of it all a couple representatives on the facebook page were just short of rude and basically just kept repeating my appointment date to me instead of trying to solve the problem. The sad part is that a technician merely needed to plug in one single coaxial cable in the communications room to activate my cable, I know this because I watched the technician perform this task already for unit 224 in the same building where I was living last week until an unfortunate set of circumstances forced us to move to another unit. I have been a Comcast customer on and off based on location for about 25 years but at this point I am completely overwhelmed by the lack of courtesy and honesty that the service team has provided.I called again on 8/8/2016 and asked that my services be disconnected on 8/18/2016 and was told that I would need to have the service installed in order to do that. I can't get the service installed that's why I am calling to cancel. I was also contacted by an executive team member who pretty much blew me off after asking for my account information. I will avoid Comcast at all costs, AT&T u-verse is less expensive, no fees for 2 HD DVR(s), No Fees for modem, comes with premium channels where a comparable package Comcast package does not, and they seem to have great customer service so far."
"Patricia of Skokie, IL","Aug. 7, 2016",1,"Internet and phone service has been sketchy forever. Called Comcast, went to Comcast's stores to get self install equipment and guess what, you need Comcast's help. Phones have not rang in my house for three weeks and Comcast wants me to pay $50.00 to fix what they ** up even though I have the service plan. Run from this company!"
"Laurie of Hamilton, VA","Aug. 6, 2016",1,The service that we receive in our area is awful. We have complained on numerous occasions and have the technicians out a number times with no improvement. I will never recommend Comcast to anyone!
"Shelby of Atlanta, GA","Aug. 5, 2016",1,"My husband and I have had both Dish and DirecTV for many years and have never had a problem with either service. Your contract ends and then your rate increases. That's it. No big deal. What a HUGE mistake in trying out Comcast. The representative gave us this so called awesome special. Several months later we noticed one of our premium channels weren't working. We called in. They said that channel is no longer on the package as they changed the package however we can pay an additional $15 we could get it back? We were like what??? We purchased the package with it? Long story short, we're getting bills higher than what was agreed on. One agent will tell you one thing and promise that the bill is fixed and then you get your bill and it's jacked up higher like $100. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!! DON'T DO IT. Go to Dish Network or DirecTV. Ugh I can't wait until my contract is up."
"HAYWOOD of Clearwater, FL","Aug. 5, 2016",1,"Only been customer for couple months but all started with install. Asked if box could be placed in a hidden area. Installer said YES but it was placed on back corner of home. Cable was never buried in ground cable. Was placed over black skirt of cable box in backyard. They jacked price after 1ST month. Returned cable equipment to Xfinity at 8 am. There were 6 people waiting to return their stuff as well. Asked if they could send e-mail of final bill to my regular email account. They said it would take 24 hrs so I waited and still got nothing. Also like how everyone at call center has accent but tell you they are in America. Very fishy. Call center is no help so just DO NOT CALL Comcast. I know I live in Florida but Mickey Mouse does not work for Comcast, or does he have a new job."
"jim of New Hope, MN","Aug. 4, 2016",1,"You sign up for something that they say will cost 99 a month with 0 initial costs (for 2 years). You get a emailed receipt for such as soon as you buy (I signed up for a $99 a month service) and a $99 charge to my credit card. You think... ""This is good. They didn't scam me."" Then 2 weeks later you start getting the shaft! They charge my credit card some type of setup fee for $15 + $10 more a month (""Oh you wanted High def.. that's an extra 10 a month"" (fine print I guess)). ""Then in June we are charging some extra fees (dude on the phone said it was a new tax out of their control. BS)."" My monthly bill is now $120 a month. By the way does not include taxes. The cable/TV and Internet that I actually get are great, but I wish I were not scammed on the $ part. I should of known, you can't trust anyone."
"Arthur of Seattle, WA","Aug. 4, 2016",1,My cable and Internet went out at the same time. At first I thought it was an outage but found out later that they said it was a bad connection at my end. Mind you I've had cable and TV here for a good while now and the service was ok at best I was able to play my games and watch television with no problems till tonight when everything just shut off and I am still waiting for it to come back on. I was told that I have to wait 3 days for someone to come out and fix their **. Yes I'm pissed.
"DJJ of Houston, TX","Aug. 3, 2016",1,"This is the worst internet service. It has broken down 25 times+ in 2.5 years. I live in the big city, not the country either. I work out of the house some with sales and this thing breaks down weekly and is down from 2 hours to 1 day or more. It is not professional enough for a business. They used to be the only provider around here now AT&T and others are starting to slide in and Comcast will lose 75% of customers. Nobody likes them. Their Mickey Mouse equipment is a joke. The modem rental is $10 monthly and the Cable/TV breaks too and has to be reset all the time as well. It's $187 monthly. Time Warner in other cities charges $99 for triple play-3 services phone internet cable. Comcast being sued now for millions. I am getting rid of them and will never use them again. A lot of people use Dish in these Townhomes when I moved in. Now I know why, the cable company Comcast is awful."
"Chris of Woodstock, GA","Aug. 2, 2016",1,"I operate a retail establishment heavily dependent on phone service. Our phone service went out Monday because of an equipment malfunction of their equipment. By phone they promised to have someone out by 5:45 the same day to replace the equipment. Ok, no problem. Things happen. At 6:30 they still no show and by then they said it would be the next day. This morning (Tuesday), today they say Wednesday maybe. Can I take them to small claims court?"
"Penny of Saratoga Springs, UT","Aug. 2, 2016",1,"Moved to Utah. Got this great deal with Comcast. Signed up and boom we have cable. Ok. So the year goes by and now my bill is nearly DOUBLE. So I call. ""Well your special PROMOTION has expired"". Me... ""So you raised your rate on your customer???"" ""Yes. This is how it works. Either you upgrade your package or sign up for another promotion. You don't get to pick your promo either. You are stuck with phone cable and internet. No way around it."" I tried to switch to another cable company but there are none in our area. We live in a new town. So I am stuck paying over 200.00 for service that shuts off every single night. I hate Comcast with a passion."
"Patricia of Culpeper, VA","Aug. 2, 2016",1,My cable has literally been freezing up for the last couple of days. As soon as every 10 minutes or so when I get home from work I like to enjoy watching it. That is why I pay good money every month as well as on time every month but cannot enjoy it. It gets so frustrating when I know the problem is not in my home it is with the service of Comcast itself. You try to get someone online to help you but of course after their office hours there is a fee for that too. I feel that with the money they charge for their services they need to have a emergency contact to actually be able to talk to a live person. This service seems to get worse and more random problems then I have ever had with any other cable network.I think they need to update their personnel to be able to take care of these problems after their office hours instead of trying to update everything else on the system which usually doesn't work half the time as they claim it does or as it should. Somebody really needs to start prorating the monthly package fees for the times that they actually work. What it all boils down to is they charge an outrageous price for their services that are not worth half of what they charge you because they are not working correctly and the customer service reps seem to have a different answer every time you speak to them. It is like no one at Comcast knows the real answer because every different one you speak with has a different answer and it is just frustrating to have to deal with that company. Period.
"David of Champlin, MN",42582,1,"Bad, bad, bad. I don't know what else to say. It's bad enough we (Comcast customers) have to fight every year to make sure our provider is offering us a fair deal but to deal with bait and switch every time you renew is not only dishonest, it should be illegal. I'll make a long story (we all know how long it takes to get a Comcast CS rep to respond to a customer) as short as possible. This is now the 2nd year in a row where a Comcast CS rep took the time to quote me a package that fit my budget. They spent at least 5 min (I know this from the chat window time stamp) to quote me a package. When I said yes, they came back and told me it wasn't available and quoted me a higher price. They refused to honor their quote, very frustrating. In most cases, I would have let this go, but they took the time to quote me, answer questions specific to the package and confirmed the package before they went to activate. So they knew what they had available. And we all know, they are sitting in front of a terminal that tells them what to offer. That said, they (rep and supervisor) refused to honor their quote. The difference was only $10/month over 24 mths. You might ask, why fight it then? It was the principle of it. They should honor what the quote, especially for loyal, long-term customers. Instead, they simple said there was nothing they could do. I ended up signing up for the deal. I am stuck in a 24-month contract with a $230 penalty if I end it early (read the fine print everyone) and I am very disappointed. This is a classic bait and switch. I plan to report them to BBB and the FCC. Good luck to all, as consumers, our choices are becoming very limited and Comcast knows it."
"Tom of Detroit, MI",42582,1,"Then put up or shut up if you are fed up with being obscenely overcharged for Comcast's internet connection!! And don't get mad, get raving angry and even! 6 frigging months into this year and my cable bill with Comcast is already in excess of $1200 and I have only had TV for 2 months with them in that entire time and have NEVER had phone service with them. (I have had 2 COMPLETELY free landline connections for over 10 years by purchasing a little known piece of hardware called an ""obihai obi200"". Google that for all the particulars beginning with how it works and cost which is now less than my initial $50 investment that has saved me $1000's in phone bill charges!!)As of this coming Monday August 1st, I am going to be looking into what we need to do to initiate a class action lawsuit or a few class action lawsuits against Comcast. And we all know including any of the sophist law ** who will be hopelessly attempting to defend Comcast's Board of Directors and wealthy stockholders with all sorts of ""technicalities"" that the following minor and major crimes against humanity are NOT allegations. They are irrefutable FACTS!False advertising, breach of contract, theft, failure to fairly compensate for abhorrent and aggravating lack of services, letting customers wait in a queue for long periods of invaluable time that by now must collectively amount to years of aborted man hours only to then be told by an automated voice for the customer to wait for a return call from a Comcast agent that NEVER is actually made by Comcast.Monopolistic practices, failure to provide hours of operation to the billing department such as AFTER 5pm and on the weekends when it would be convenient for hundreds of thousands to contact Comcast regarding Comcast's business S.N.A.F.U.s, deliberately stopping services before billing questions have been adequately resolved in order to gouge the customer with turning off then service back on fees and fleecing each of us out of still more of our hard earned money so they can maximize their profits and etc, and last and by no means least lots more etc's.Email me with how they have used you and so I can begin filing the lawsuit as soon as I have 100 costumes who are more than justifiably angry ""...as hell and not going to take it anymore!"" Total revenue at Philadelphia-based Comcast (The largest U.S. cable operator and the No. 1 U.S. high-speed Internet provider), whose holdings include CNBC, rose 8.5 percent to $19.25 billion in the fourth quarter, surpassing analysts' expectations of $18.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. CNBC Wednesday, 3 Feb 2016. RCN in Philadelphia charges $50 a month for 155 mbs Internet speed. No contract required.

"David of Chambersburg, PA",42580,1,"My complaint is so sad, it's funny. I found some equipment I think belongs to Comcast. It was in the middle of the street as if it had fallen off of a truck. Trying to be nice, I called the number for the local office to see if they would claim it. The recorded message gave me three specific choices, none of which applied to this situation, so I picked ""start a new account."" I was routed to a call center six states away. When I explained the problem they hung up on me. I tried again, and this time, they routed me to customer service (still not in state). I asked them for the phone number of the local Comcast office, and they said they couldn't find it and they couldn't call them. In other words, A COMPANY THAT SPECIALIZES IN COMMUNICATIONS IS UNABLE TO CALL ONE OF THEIR OWN OFFICES. So yeah, the equipment is now in the dumpster."
"Don of Lake Worth/Palm Springs, Fl, FL",42580,1,"Recently I had an appointment with CC to install new equipment with a 2 hour window, 8 - 10. Due to limited time, at 8:08, I put a TIME DATED note on the door saying I was taking a quick shower, and to please give me a minute. After showering, I noticed I had a message from CC time dated 8:15, saying they were there and couldn't get anyone to the door. They give me a 2 hour window, and I can't get 7 minutes??? I called their number and got a smart** on the phone who basically said I had to reschedule and ""here's the times, pick one, take it or leave it!"" Having no choice I rescheduled to the following morning. The guy who came the next day, told me that installers were to give the customer 15 minutes, which I clearly did not get.Yes, I called and complained and I'm sure it got no further that the poor girl who spoke broken English. Pathetic, poor service. I didn't stop there: For the past two years, I've had two accounts with CC, one in GA, and one in FL. Due to poor service, I cancelled service in GA, about 3 weeks ago are returned the equipment. This week when I contacted CC, the only account they could find was the GA account which has been cancelled. Contacting someone online in customer service, and especially online, is near impossible. You have to give tons of information to log in, and when you finally get a ""robot"" to answer, they ask redundant questions that you've already spent several minutes supplying to get them in the first place. Yesterday when I went thru this process, they could not find my FL account, the only one they could find was the GA account which has been cancelled.I'm amazed at the costs of cable in the first place and they just keep going up, and up, and up, adding crap charges that you have no idea what they are. God forbid calling for an explanation if you have high blood pressure!! I'm in a condo who contracts to CC and I have no other choice other than putting a dish in my living room, which sometimes I seriously consider. Wouldn't it be great to have a big company such as CC, to actually listen to you and sincerely tried to solve your problems, instead of treating you like a prisoner, which basically I am? Instead you are ultimately told the KMA, and ""live with it"". If you have a choice, I strongly urge you to do your homework before signing on to CC."
"Kelly of Pittston, PA",42579,1,"I knew going in that this company is the WORST! The local office is up the st. and has bulletproof glass protecting reps!! This company said they changed their billing from EAST to WEST. What do I care!! 0 and it cancelled my promotional package... I have had only ONE correct bill since LAST NOV! I was being charged for something that should have been included... 10 phone calls and A CHAT later... they terminated my service over $24 in overdue charges that were late fees FOR SERVICES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE!!! There was ZERO option for me but to pay it, even after 10 different people and a recorded chat said they were removing the charges!! HATE THIS JOKE OF A COMPANY! Doesn't even matter if you have their lies in PRINT!!"
"mark of Ashburnham, MA",42577,1,"We had a very nice installer put Xfinity DVR service for 3 rooms into our house yesterday. It worked great for that afternoon. Last night a recording showed oddness (stalling and hard to restart), then this afternoon the DVR box went into a reboot loop. It shuts off, goes through its boot process, gets a bit into that, then does it again and again. That is not the reason for this review - that is a piece of new computer hardware and they break usually very soon after turning them on if they are going to break. BUT we called customer service and told them we have been a customer for about 24 hours and the box broke. They said, ""No repair person will be available for 5 days"". 5 days?? This is the cheapest crap box company I have ever known. They do not hire sufficient techs, they don't offer refunds etc. If you have a choice, DONT use them!"
"savanpatelsp18@gmail.com of Lithia Springs, GA",42577,5,Comcast got good service as well as helpful people working with them. Mr. Travis ** Comcast agent helped me out to get back old plan service I would like to put forward that if any of you need help try contacting. He will surely help you out and provide beneficial package for you. 100% satisfied with his work.
"V. of Um No, CA",42576,1,"I would give them ZERO STARS! I left California, and my then address in 2011, after roommates essentially stole my lease. (I had work abroad. They would only guarantee thirty days rent making me liable for the whole lease -- then they went to the landlord and requested the lease -- CRRREEEPY). The last internet bill includes their debt and I will not pay it. In addition, Comcast charged me for a crappy modem I had returned!! Five years later a zombie debt collector (""Stellar Recovery"") has filed credit agency claims against me. Do not under any circumstances get internet from Comcast. They bill erroneously and you would join hundreds of former customers getting years of harassment from zombie debt collectors."
"John of Brunswick, MD",42576,1,"Comcast... service ordered on July 6th... promised install on the 14th - ""that's the soonest we can do it"". Tech shows up on the 14th and says the cable under the alley is broke. Utilities have to come and replace it. Was promised the work to be done on the 25th (today). Came home from the hospital to find no work being done. Called Comcast. ""No, we aren't scheduled to do that work until August 4th"". Complained to Comcast. ""No, no one here ever told you that it would be done on the 25th"". But they wanted to reschedule the interior install that they have scheduled for tomorrow... which means they did promise to do the work on the 25th. And no, they will not escalate or expedite the work."
"Kiu of Rohnert Park, CA",42576,1,"DO NOT go with Comcast. MUST read other reviews. I had to wait 10 days for an installer to come in. When he did he had no idea what he was doing. Left after 4.5 hours saying he talked to his supervisor and they be back the next day to finish the job. He cut my old wires and just left everything unfinished. He gave me his supervisor's number. Next day came and no one showed up. I called the number, got a voicemail and left messages. Finally I called Comcast/XFINITY to find out I have a new insulation schedule between 4-6 pm six days later. To make the story shorts, after being online for over two hours the customer service ""supervisor"" promised they will call me back within an hour with a ""Urgent"" installation request! Of course that never happened so I called back, same song and dance with another agent!! Basically I have no other options but to wait another two days to see if anyone shows up! No internet or TV for 6 days because of these idiots!!!"
"Jennifer of Margate, FL",42576,1,Why the hell would this company hire people from another country when so many people in America need jobs! It is so damn aggravating... And they all change the policies by the minute. If Uverse would come in to my area I would def change in a heart beat! Comcast/Xfinity please get your ish together!
"Cheryl of Hingham, MA",42575,1,"I wrote a few days ago about the unbelievably poor customer service I have been receiving regarding unwarranted charges to my account. I still have a $496 charge when my costs should have been $109. Everyone admits the problem is on their end, but in over 10 days, no refund. I will continue writing all over the internet until something changes. NO COMPANY should be in business with a 0% customer service satisfaction. BTW, the better customer service number is 800 266 2278. If you call 800XFINITY you get the Philippines. At least I get to speak with someone here in this country and someone who will offer a direct line# when you have problems that have been as outrageously unresolved as I have.Now I have no service and called CS again yesterday. First I was told ""there is NO SUCH THING as SAME DAY SERVICE...."" then I was given a choice of between 8A to 10A or 10A to 12N for today. I chose the latter. I called at 11:40A because we hadn't even received the advance phone call. I was told he updated and said he would be there between 11:30A and 12N. At 12:39, I called again and was told I was RESCHEDULED now between 1P and 3P with expected arrival between 2P and 2:30P....no phone call....RESCHEDULED arrival??? They said they had me down for 8A to 10A, which makes this new time even MORE EGREGIOUS. What's wrong with this company? How do you ever stay in business? I now had to reschedule to TUESDAY because of appointments on Monday. My tenant has been without TV and internet since FRIDAY. Does anyone at this company even care? I have at least 4 ticket numbers that I have taken the time to save. With the other calls I just asked them ""What difference would it make?"" I was told ""none."" If you have a choice, go with Verizon Fios or any other company. "
"Pamela of Callahan, FL",42575,1,"Initially I was having an issue with one of my boxes. So I called CS and got someone outside of the U.S. After discussing the issue, I asked about bundling my service. I had at that time had another provider for phone and internet. The CSR told me my price, and the phone services I would receive. That was on 6/27. Today is 7/24. My phone is still not activated. Initially I hooked up my modem and phone probably about a week later as all the equipment came in the mail. However, I could not get the modem to work properly so I had to call and schedule a technician.First of all let me say, no one said there would be a $50 charge for that person to come out. I have later learned that any technician coming to your home for any reason will be a $50 service charge. To continue with my story, that appointment got cancelled by the technician on 7/3 as he was running late. It wasn't him that called but a CSR. That was fine. The next appointment I had to cancel and I rescheduled online. However the tech showed up anyway and I wasn't home. All this I could deal with. However, each time I have had an appointment made, I go check online in my account that I set up and my appointment is never there and whoever I get out of the U.S. can never confirm it even though I have talked to someone via phone and they set up my appointment.OK so the tech finally makes it out, mind you he is supposed to bring a DVR box that I didn't receive on my initial delivery and when he arrives the first thing he says is ""I'm here to take care of (not those exact words but similar) a low hanging wire."" I said, ""no my phone and internet needs to be hooked up to work properly."" Later he told me that was an ""install fail"" and that is the language I should use when I call them back because they were confused. The technician determined I needed a new cable so I had to confirm on the phone that he could come back and install it for $30. I said ""fine"". While the CSR was on the phone with him and me, I asked him to get her to confirm that he was going to get my phone working. She had no record of a phone being bundled with my package. Mind you on 6/27 the deal I made with the rep was going to be $159 with phone, internet, and TV.So on 7/3 I talked to another rep at length about my bundled package and we now included the DVR again for $7. OK, fine. However, in between all of this the tech comes back on a different day, adds the cable, but does not activate my phone. He says I need to call in the next day so that I can keep my same number I have had for 30 years. This was an issue I had with changing phone services initially back on 6/27. I would not have accepted this package. I would have kept it the way it was. But the CSR on 6/27 assured me he changed everything in the system for me to keep my phone.I have talked to I'm guessing 8 different people and each time I confirm what I need to do to keep my phone number. They say as soon as my phone is working with them to call my current provider and tell them to cancel my service and I already have Comcast keeping my phone number. OK, I'm still nervous about everything and wondering daily if I have made a mistake in changing my service. The guy initially on 6/27 assured me ""don't worry you can change this in 30 days if you don't like it."" I felt like I may as well take a chance. I can change my service back. However, It has been almost a month and the Customer Service is so horrendous that I'm really worried about keeping my phone. The Internet is working, and the TV channels are great (I got more with the new package), but now the ""Solutions Department"" called on 7/19 and spoke to me at great length on my dissatisfaction.Finally I thought someone in the U.S. that is making me feel comfortable. I can't tell you how many hours I have spent on the phone with different people. The number one problem is that one hand does not know what the other hand is doing. If you speak to someone on Chat, or on the Phone, it is the biggest circus I have ever encountered. It seems that no one keeps account of what a customer has already called about and you have to explain yourself over and over each time you call. It gets better!After I initially talked with the Solutions Department, the lady gave me her name ""Gwen"" and her personal extension number to call if I had any questions at all. She assured me I could deal with her from this point on. She also had taken care of the $50 charge that I was unaware of, as I told her my problems are not resolved. She also made an appointment for someone to come out ""8/13"" on a Saturday because that is the only time I could be here and that was the earliest appointment someone could come out and get my phone working. She also promised my service would be back dated. That was 7/19.On 7/20 I noticed something about my new changes that I had a question about and tried to call Gwen on her extension number. She had told me numerous times that she was in a different time zone, and I would have to call the 1800 that she gave me and ask them to transfer me to Mississippi. Well they said due to privacy issues they could not transfer me to anyone. They did not have that capability. Needless to say I was very upset. Finally after speaking with this person who was not in the U.S., they transferred me to the Solutions department and I got a sarcastic person who could not locate Gwen even with the extension number she gave me and I had to explain all the problems I have had over the past several weeks with appointments, service connection, price.Oh by the way, one reason I called was when I looked online at my account, my bill was $489. I was horrified and that is what I wanted to call and ask Gwen about. I couldn't believe that this person gave me a phone number and an extension and a name and no one could find her. How stupid and unprofessional is that. The girl that I spoke to on 7/20 made it sound like I made it up and that she could not explain why ""someone would do that."" Another words - why a CSR Solutions person would give me an extension and her name because they just don't do that. I told her several times she was talking condescending to me, and she said she wasn't. She was talking to me like I was an ignorant customer.So here we on on 7/24, I don't call because its a nightmare. I will have to hope and pray that on 8/13 someone shows up with my DVR box, and the readiness to fix my phone. I also hope that I get to keep my number of 30 years. Oh yes, I forgot, when I talked to Gwen, I had to agree to a two year contract. I thought, well she sounds like she knows what is best for me, and she said ""don't worry. I will take care of you."" So I had to confirm on the phone while she listened to a two year contract. You can understand my concerns now when I try to reach her the next day, and the people I get hold of act like she doesn't exist.I really wish I had kept my service for phone and Internet the way it was, and just got my new box to replace the one that wasn't working. All this grief could have been avoided but this company is in the business of selling things and once they get you to sign that contract, it's money in the bag. It's so funny too, everytime you call they want you to do the Customer Survey. Why? It doesn't help you improve your customer service. My advice would be to get all of your CSR's in the origin of the country that you do business in. As I see it, again, one hand doesn't have a clue as to what the other hand is doing from the CSR's outside the U.S. from the CSR's and techs inside the U.S.Oh yeah, when you call be prepared to spend 5 minutes trying to get to the right department. And be prepared to be rerouted several times when you call because that is not the right department. Be prepared to spend much of your time explaining and reexplaining and feeling like the person on the other end does not have a clue as to what is going on. Except in my case I thought I found that person ""Gwen"" however I could not contact her after that initial first time. She assured me and made me feel at ease.There is much more to this story that happened in phone conversations each time I called or Chatted online, but I can't go into it all, with the many hours I have spent with this company. I'm hoping that all this will be resolved and in the end my bill will only be a little over $200. That I will get to keep my phone number is so important to me, but I'm very worried that that won't happen. Bottom line, after all of this heartache, I don't recommend Comcast or Infinity or whatever they call themselves at all."
"michelle of Hermitage, TN",42574,1,"My father is elderly and on a fixed income. We had Comcast service for years, with our bill always being wrong, over-charging, and confusing explanations as to why or what. So I called to cancel my dad's service. At that time they said because I was a VALUED customer, they would offer me basic cable and internet for 89.99 a month. That the promo was not in my area, to disregard my bill and pay the amount agreed. We verbally entered a two year rate contract via telephone in which I had to agree to the terms and conditions. They had me pay the past due amount so we could start fresh and told me how much to pay until they ""manually"" corrected the bill. I was asked to pay another 59.00 via phone which I did, and pay the rate of 120.00 as agreed with taxes included. I did all of those things. The bill was never corrected. They cut my service off twice for non-payment and I waited for hours to connect to someone to get it back on. They told me they would not charge the disconnect since it wasn't my error, I paid what I was asked to. The second time they disconnected me, once they turned it on, my upstairs TV would no longer work. Another two hours of them sending signals that didn't work. I had to wait a week for a tech to come out and was told I would be credited for the week with no service. Not only did that NOT happen, they charged me for tech coming out!! So I called again to wait for a couple hours to get to the right place. To be told the help ticket they put in for my account was denied. ""What do you mean? I didn't ask you to do me any favors, you were trying to correct the fees for what YOU offered me!"" They told me I should of never been offered that rate, and that I would not get that rate, and I owed over 600.00 for a triple bundle pack I did not even have! They said they could offer me a different more expensive promo but that was it. OK, so If I just quit paying you, you would go back to the recorded call and make me pay a whole two year contract but YOU don't have to honor it??? That's highly illegal! I called back fuming, and ask for the supervisor of the legal department. I informed them that what was going on was very illegal, and my elderly father was stuck with no way to the outside world if they cut us off. Obviously I can't afford a lawyer, but thankfully I got through to someone who either knows the laws, or has some freaking common sense and said they would get my account credit applied and fixed, backdated and all. I am not holding my breath. I know the girl was sincere, she seemed appalled by my situation, but until I see it I will not believe it.As of today, I have spent a combined total of over 15 hours on the phone trying to get what this company OFFERED ME!! Don't buy into the commercials about improving customer services, or you being number one, because my dad is too sick to fight this company, and if it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have any tv or outside world entertainment. Worst company EVER, hands down. Once Google starts offering options, I believe Comcast will be out of business. If you have any other choice in your area, TAKE it. Do NOT struggle with what I have been through."
"Tammy of Hephziba, GA",42573,1,"I am writing this letter with a heavy heart. I have had disappointments in my life, but none as I have had in the last 4 days with Comcast. You may say I am being over dramatic, maybe, but I do know this, I have never been so disgusted with a company, while trying to get closure on a (consumer) problem. Let me explain: On Sunday, July 17, 2016, our Comcast cable was struck by lightning. It fried the Comcast cable lines (from the street on through), our TV's, our surround sound, the modem and receivers. Everything that was cabled to the modem. Our computers, appliances, iPads, cell phones, etc., were fine as they were not connected to the cable. I called Comcast, put in a ticket for damage, set up an appointment to have new Comcast cables run. I received an appointment for Tuesday July 19, 2016, 8-10 am. Not a problem, no TV's, no cable, no internet, nothing... I'll deal. I took off work, waited, waited, no show. I called Comcast, another 45-60 min hold time. It is now 12:30pm. I was informed that the person who scheduled my appt. put in the time window from 3-5pm. Since I have an hour drive to work, it was senseless to go in because of the corrected appt. of 3-5pm. Btw, he was late, although very nice, he was still late, he did not get to my home until 5:30pm. He ran all new cable, picture attached of the new cable lying on my lawn, connected the new modem, receiver and receiver relay. Checked the Internet, golden, cannot verify tv, because like I stated above, they were fried due to being connected to the modem.I called Comcast today to see where my damage ticket stood and was told it was declined due to an act of nature. So I put a call into the corporate office, opened a corporate ticket. This very nice person called me back, and again, it was declined. I asked her to submit another ticket, as she was doing so, she said that it will probably be declined since the previous ticket had been declined. I told her, I do not care, submit the ticket. I then asked her a very simple question, ""how can Comcast deny my claim if it was ""their"" cables that got hit by lightning, traveled through my home and fried everything, including the Comcast cables?"" She could not answer this. This ticket # **, is for Comcast to cover the items, TV's (2) and my surround sound, that was fried, yes due to lightning, the lightning that struck and fried the Comcast cable lines.I have suffered much loss between equipment, phone calls and time from work, not to mention that I am paying for a service that I have not had for the last 4 days, that this is very much unacceptable behavior from your corporation. As a single mother who has worked very hard for what I have and providing for my family, I do not have much and now I have even less. With that being said, I am reaching out to you in all fairness for compassion and doing what is the right thing to do! I thank you for your time!"
"Charles of Millersville, MD",42573,1,"I've just been trying to change service over from my mother (who is 80 something and is losing it as well as being in the hospital) to my name so I can pay the bills. So far, it's taken over 6 months and we're nowhere closer to finding a solution. Everyone tells you a different story and no one knows what they are doing. Do yourself a favor and get whatever other carrier you can."
"Torie of Ladson, SC",42573,1,"If you have the choice to choose someone else besides Xfinity or Comcast, please do so! Take this review and learn from my mistake of choosing them! Their customer service is the worst I have ever dealt with in a company. And this is on multiple accounts! The employees do not care about whether you are satisfied or happy with your service. And the employees have no idea what they are talking about! I have been hung up on many times through transfers with departments with no call back, and I have been given the wrong equipment 3 times. By far the worst company I have ever dealt with. I would never recommended them!"
"Deneen of Bolton, MA",42573,1,"I recently called Comcast just to activate internet only because I was going to go with DirecTV. The rep told me that I would pay less if I bundled internet and cable. I asked him to explain the packages to me which he did. He told me that I could get 75 Mbps plus 2 DVR's and one cable box all for $126.90 TOTAL including ALL fees. Guess what? Boxes came yesterday and internet is only 25 Mbps and my bill is $154. When I called CS, they told me that they are not responsible for what their rep discusses over the phone??? How is that possible? I was told that if I wanted 75 Mbps, there would be an extra fee of $10. I asked if they record the conversations and they said they did not know who I spoke with. This just doesn't seem right. If we aren't satisfied for any reason within 30 days, we can cancel."
"Sharon of Houston, TX",42570,1,"This is absolutely the worst company for customer service. Do Not use them. They don't care about YOU!! I ask for a call before they come to my house to install the internet, as I work. I did not get a call, I got a call when they were at my house, I said I will be there in 15-20 minutes they said no. We can't wait. We must reschedule for the end of the week. No matter how much I pleaded with the technician that I needed this for work. I was in my car racing while I was speaking to him. I said I am almost there 5 minutes, he left. When I called to get a supervisor NO ONE would help.Finally I reached someone who said they would get with a supervisor to try and get me set up the next day. He said, ""I promise I will check on the first thing when I come in and call you"". HE DIDN'T CALL ME BACK. When I called them it was, ""Sorry, he was not around for the call,"" and it was ""I guess he couldn't help you"". Really this is how you treat your paying customers. If I did this in my business I would be unemployed. If I had a choice I would NOT use them but the area I am in has some contract with them, unfortunately. If you have a choice do not use Comcast. They only care about signing you up. There is no customer service, they could care less."
"Jan of Beverly, MA",42570,1,"My mother's phone was out and I called for service, saying she is 97 years old and needs a phone at all times. The service people checked the connection and said that indeed, she DID need a technician and that on an emergency basis, they would get one out the next day. I went to her home which is in a retirement community to wait. After a couple of hours, I decided to call them to make sure they knew where it was, and get an update from them.I got on the automated service, gave my phone number, and they told me they would be there within the next half hour. ""Great,"" I thought. Then the automated service said, ""Do you want to cancel this appointment?"" I said, ""NO!"" The automated voice came back and said, ""Your appointment is canceled."" Needless to say, I was very upset. It took me eight minutes to get to a real person after that, and they said that there was NOTHING they could do about this. They would send another technician out tomorrow. This was totally unacceptable and unbelievable to me. SO close and yet SO far away. When I called customer service again this morning, it was more of the same. No recompense except for the two days that her service was out. Her service had been out for a few days previous to this, but they did not count this because no one had called to complain. I still feel violated for hours of my time."
"Karey of Peachtree City, GA",42570,1,"We switched to Comcast over a month ago and it has been one of the... if not THE WORST experiences I've had with ANY company in my life. An installer and/or technician has been to our house a total of six (6) different times to fix our cable/internet and we are still having problems. Installer will come to check the connections and say, ""we are not getting a good signal from the street."" They will pass the buck to the ""Guys is the Big Truck"" as they call them. These technicians will come out check the connection from the street and say the signal is good (or that they fix something) and arrange for the installer to come back out. This has happened 3 times we still don't have a solid connection! Unbelievable... need more internet options other than AT&T and Comcast."
"Smok of Bellevue, WA",42569,1,"Comcast is a terrible company. I wish there was no star rating because they don't deserve even one star. Have been with Comcast for over 5 years because my area has no other internet provider. And because the package, I also kept them for the TV services. Every year, I negotiate new 12 month TV/internet package with a certain price and more less it has been Ok. Now, being 3 month into new 12 month contract I got a higher bill than usual. So I called them and was told that my bill went up because they just got increase in some Sports Franchise fees. What a hell? If we have a contract for a fixed price, then stick with it. I wish I could jack up prices in a middle of a contract with my customers. When I called them, Comcast customer service informed that I can either pay the higher bills or cancel the service."
"Ned of Skokie, IL",42569,1,"Comcast had a cheap offer for home internet/phone service years ago & wanting to save money I regrettably signed w/ them. Almost on every single billing statement was an unknown charge which I had to call customer service about which Comcast could not understand what the charge was for exactly. After calling & supposedly resolving the erroneous charges, they would do the exact same thing again the following month. I had to cancel w/ them before the year contract. After much complaining they let me out. Then on top of that they would send special offer junk mail almost every other week which I called about & they said they would stop but of course I still get them. Comcast is garbage, an absolutely horrible company."
"sj of Locust Grove, VA",42567,1,"STOP allowing this company to infect our community and take over overcharging our neighborhoods. Comcast infects all of us with bait and switch. VOTE NO to allowing them to continue moving into our community with screwing everyone they can. Well, NO one can find THEIR Comcast contract I signed, so MY copy is worthless with all their supposed additional increases EVERY year. OVER 100% increase with ADDED fees, in ADDITION to the overcharges for NON working WEEKS of NO service. Couldn't call 911 for emergency! NO internet for 2 weeks. NO TV for 2 weeks, and now only at intervals at random times daily! I have logged (in THEIR system) over 150 calls of NO service in a year, yet, their ""right to increase from $89/mo (really ends up being $134/mo) will NOW go up to at LEAST $200/mo.Terms of contract keeps changing with each person I talk to. Then I'm told by administration that COMCAST is NOT responsible for what the call takers say or promise. They can say anything, promise anything and the customer can do NOTHING about it. Forget credit, or contract rate agreements. They don't exist!!! Rude people that continue sending your call to other departments, that can't help you because ""that is not my area"". To make a nightmare longer, you end up paying for their great bait and switch while they keep repeating the ADs of TV lingo of cheap prices, no service, equipment that does not work, and the ""bundle"" fails at least 3 hrs EVERY day. I seriously think everyone needs to call their area gov rep to complain and vote to DENY any future applications to ""moving into or trying to increase service areas"". THEIR public voters are being screwed by their being sold non services providers."
"Sylvain of San Francisco, BC",42565,1,"If you sign with Comcast, it is very likely you'll have to deal with their customer service - and probably on a regular basis. Fees, already high compared with other companies, go up very, very frequently, with no warning. The surly customer service person I spoke to today when said that ""Comcast does let you know, it sends you a bill with a higher price on and you can call them and try to negotiate it down"" - it's as if I were forced to buy a car every few months. They offered to discount the price rise - of around $50! - but only if I sign a contract for 2 more years. I have only stuck with them for convenience, but I am going to find an alternative provider."
"Shalitha of Fair Oaks, CA",42565,1,"If you have ANY other option (even cellular based internet) DO NOT, I mean DO NOT go with Comcast. Read other reviews. Constant Speed drops. Advertised at 150 Mbps, but get around 30 Mbps. Some days it's down to 0.9 Mbps. No change in network devices or cabling in the house. But they claim something is wrong. Oh! I forgot, my pet squirrel loves to unplug wires. So that must be it. Seriously people? Get some proper English speaking customer support specialists!!!"
"Emily of Miw, MN",42565,1,"I spoke with a young girl name Marry for a package deal. She was very pushy and she was annoying. I could barely understand her. She sounded like a 3-year old child. When I tell her I will have to call her back and hang up she has her boss call me!!! Her boss by the name Nick is even more pushy than her. He refused. I ""had to speak with his employer again."" I then told him ""I am not getting the package at this time. I will have to call you back."" These people are demanding. They are rude and they have no respect! I been a loyal customer to Comcast for years! But they keep getting worse and worse as time goes on. The guy who hooks up the cable broke my TV and were they loyal to their customer after that? No, absolutely not. If I continue to get treated the way I have by Comcast! They can thank Dish Network for stealing another customer!!! What a joke."
"Anthony of Shorewood, IL",42564,1,"I lost my job so I called to reduce my monthly payments. The customer rep quoted me at 39.99 for the 75 mbps blast internet. I said ""that's fine."" He then transferred me to someone else and then she claimed they cannot give me the internet for that price (she quoted me at 69.99), but it is cheaper to bundle the blast internet with a basic cable package (49.99). She must have said blast internet on the phone at least 10 times. I purchased that bundle since it fit my needs for the time being. Two days later I realize my internet is only 25 mbps. I called back and told them my problem and they simply told me even though they misquoted me and gave me the wrong information, they cannot do anything about it and I'd have to pay more. I was misquoted 3 times!!! I've worked as a sales manager and if I misquote a price or product, you better believe I gave them the product for the price I quoted them on. Terrible customer service and I will be cancelling."
"Curtis of Stuart, FL",42564,1,"I am new to Comcast, and I wish I never knew of them. It took them over a week to get my internet working, time they billed me for anyway -- this is not counting the hours and hours I spent on the phone and with their technician. Then they, all on their own, upgraded my service, and my bill. They said that I asked for it. I did NOT! They did refund me my money."
"Ellen of Fresno, CA",42563,1,"In a nutshell, In 2012-2014 I signed up for cable from a rep that came to my door. After having the service increase in price I cancelled it. They sent an agent to my home to collect a payment. The agent said he needed to apply a payment today or he won't get more service calls assigned to him. I said, ""No, I don't pay people who come to my door"". He said he would report to Comcast I paid in cash and come back to get the cash later so he did not lose his accounts. I said, ""no"". He did it anyway. A few days later he came back for payment. I felt sorry for him so I paid him (he had called and applied a payment to my acct when he said he did). A few weeks later he was back! I said, ""no"" and asked him not to return. He came again and I asked him again not to return. He was making me nervous. I am a single mother and he had been in my house once. I called Comcast and told them and asked them to not allow him back. First they denied they send people out then said, ""ok"".I then get a TV box sent to me. I did not want TV. I called Comcast and they said it was a special. It was $19 a month so I said, ""ok"". A week later it was turned off. I called them and asked them what was going on. They said they just discovered a past due balance (from the above creepy guy issue) and would not turn back on the TV service I did not order until it was paid in full! So, I said, ""You sent me a TV box, turned it on for a full week and then discovered this balance? Or did you send me the box to get me hooked on the TV so I felt compelled to pay the creepy guy balance?""I returned the equipment. I sent a letter requesting they cancel the balance from the strange encounter with their agent. I cancelled all services. 3 years later I discover that my son is not being allowed to order service due to the balance on my old account. I was told it was because of the household debt rule. I also looked up my old account and it still shows that my TV service is connected! I called and they told me it was not showing connected on their screen and to ""trust"" them it is not active! Trust them?!? I told them I expected a huge bill at some time when they decide to update that 3 year old account and have to go through this all over again!I looked up the account that they are charging my son for and it has my address and phone number associated with it. Comcast said that can't be because they are not allowed to associate the same phone and address with a separate account. The account of course has gone to collections. We just found this out because as soon as my son tried to get service the collection agency called! How convenient! Hours and hours later I am still trying to get someone to help me and stop telling me this could not have happened. I have documentation from the original time I reported it. Comcast does not seem to care about that. I cannot believe that it is legal to begin unsolicited service to an account just to get payment. It should never take a week to ""discover"" an issue.I cannot believe that a company would hire agents and knowingly send them to a person's home after I reported that he had done something illegal (posted a payment I never made) and that he made me uncomfortable since I was a single mother with a young daughter. This issue alone is frightening, but the worst thing is when I reported again the Comcast rep wanted to know why I was complaining he gave me an extra week to pay!!! All in all, three years later this ugly problem is back after I thought it was resolved and now my son is involved and could in theory hurt his credit and they will not work with me! This is one of the many reasons I no longer have anything but digital bunny ear tv and AT&T internet."
"Patricia of Arnold, PA",42563,1,"I work in New Kensington/Arnold, PA and continue to be held hostage by Comcast. Pretty much for the past 2 months, we have lost internet service intermittently. They are seldom able to help and whenever contacted, it's always something else -- never Comcast. Now today, we have NO PHONE service. Trying to contact Comcast, is like trying to contact an alien. NO ONE responds. Their customer service is anything BUT customer service. They know there's a problem, but do not have CLUE what it is or how to help businesses.For a business that is 24x7 and relies on phone service, this is unacceptable. I've been on hold most of today. Phones still not working (nor is COMCAST). Our office phones in Fox Chapel have also been out of service causing us to lose client calls as well as calls from our caregivers. We constantly have issues -- no one can ever help. Today was a perfect example. Called their so called CUSTOMER SERVICE number -- also didn't work. Called all afternoon and kept getting disconnected. When I did get someone to answer, they transferred and disconnected me again. Called back, waited on hold again, got someone else to tell me they had no idea how to help. That in a nutshell is the problem --- NO ONE WORKS THERE.... Can anyone help customers -- why is comcast able to continue without major fines??? At the very least, customers should be reimbursed for lost revenue and productivity."
"robin of Jacksonville, FL",42563,1,"For approximately 3 weeks now have had very poor reception on TVs and internet and phone service that comes and goes whenever it wants to. Now today at my small business difference location I have NO phone service as this has been an ongoing issue. Comcast has the ability to automatically forward phones to cell, but that has not happened this time and now I have been on hold for 25 minutes, I repeat 25 minutes all while trying to run a business with no phone. I must be an idiot if I stay with them. Do yourself a favor and call AT&T for phones and DirecTV for entertainment."
"Mary of Princeton, IL",42563,1,"I have spoken with five different representatives regarding my address book. My group email is no longer working. I can't send a group email. I use my email for business. I have also sent emails and have been told that this would be fixed in 24 to 48 hours. The problem surfaced FIVE days ago. At this point I am unable to get even a live voice. This is very upsetting. Sending emails is even difficult. I PAY for Comcast internet, phone and TV and expect better service. HELP."
"J of Fort Lauderdale, FL",42562,1,Service has been extremely unreliable. We are a internet based company and we need internet that is more reliable. I have been nothing but very unimpressed with your service. 19 Phone calls and counting to your Customer Service Line. On top of that it took almost 2 1/2 weeks for you to get a technician out here to literally plug in a modem as we were already hardwired hence the damn Comcast sticker on the door that says this office is equipped and ready for Comcast. If I had the time I would leave Comcast a bad review on every website I could think of. Heck I would like to spend money on a website and that URL would be Comcastsucks.com/reallybad. I hope whoever reads this does something about the service in this area as it is not just my office here that is having problems!!
"leonard of Lawrenceville, GA",42562,1,"Their customer service is terrible. You can talk to 5 different people and get 5 different answers. I signed up for a package that I was told it would be a set amount for 2 years. I have now had it for 1 year and my price went up by 80.00. At first I gave them the benefit of the doubt that it was just a training issue but after speaking to numerous people I have come to the conclusion that I was intentionally misled. I was also told there was a 200 dollar gift card with free installation, but it turns out it was only a 50 dollar gift card and I had to pay for installation. I am getting ready to cancel my service and pay the early termination fee.Updated 8/3/2016 - I gave up trying to deal with Comcast customer service. They are not helpful at all. After misleading me on several different things I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. I received a call from their corporate office and they are just as useless and care nothing about their customers. So I decided to pay the early termination fees and go with AT&T. I refuse to do business with a company that will mislead you and then not stand behind what you were told."
"archie of Johns Creek, GA",42562,1,"I was a Comcast customer for over 30 years, the last 15 or so I paid $150 a month, never missed... When I recently moved, they didn't service the area I moved to, so I had to switch... Now they have me in collections for the equipment they say I didn't return (I have the UPS receipt) and the monthly fees for the balance of the 24 months they say I owe. I ain't going to pay them."
"Janet of Vinton, VA",42561,1,"Comcast cable is the most horrible cable company I have ever dealt with. My cable boxes went out July 8 in the evening and Tech Support sent signals to the boxes (2 of them) and this did not resolve the issue. I was told to take the boxes in to switch them out on Saturday. I get there and the office was closed. 25 miles and wasted gas because I was given inaccurate information. Called Comcast while at the office and they said they would set up an appt but that didn't happen. I called back Saturday evening, an agent said the appt was set for today Sunday July 10 for between 1 and 4 and was given a ticket number. 4 pm came and went without a technician showing up. I called AGAIN and was told that appointment was not set up. The last person I spoke with said the appointment would be July 14. This is completely unacceptable. I told them to disconnect my service! This is horrible customer service. I will go without TV and cable before I go back to Comcast. NBC, you should look at how this company is NOT taking care of its customers and equipment because I has the same issue less than 2 months ago. Sincerely, an angry Comcast former customer. One more thing... when inconvenienced, they will not even talk about crediting your account!!!"
"Marie of Rochester, MI",42560,1,"When it came time to transfer our Comcast service to a new address, due to an upcoming move, we were sure to notify Comcast a week in advance. The representative assured us that all we needed to do was to notify Comcast and move our equipment to the new residence, where we would set it up. Following our move, we found that the services was not working, and contacted Comcast customer service. After speaking with 5 different representatives, we came to little resolution. Often we were transferred from representative to representative, without any explanation given. Each time, we had to re-explain our situation. Once, a representative agreed to look into the issue and call us back in 20 minutes. He never called back. Eventually we spoke to a supervisor, who was extremely rude and actually hung up on us! When calling back, I spoke to a ""Taylor,"" who provided no resolution for the poor treatment we received by the previous supervisor.After over an hour on the phone with Taylor, it was finally discovered that our service was never transferred - even after Comcast had confirmed that it was - and a service tech needed to be sent to our home. Mind you, it took 3 hours to come to this conclusion. They were unable to send a technician until days later, regardless of the fact that we had given a week notice in our move, and both work from home. The technician stated that our equipment that worked at our previous residence was not compatible with service on this side of the state of Michigan, and stated that it would have to be replaced. The technician then replaced it with IDENTICAL equipment. When the technician provided sign documentation and asked that I sign, indicating that I agreed to pay all charges, I declined. Yet - we were still charged a $50 installation fee.When calling Comcast back, the representative, ""Shane"" (ID: **) indicated in poor English that the service charge was valid and refused to compensate us for the issue. When asked to clarify, Shane used several incomprehensible phrases and again concluded that the service charge was valid. We are extremely dissatisfied with our customer service experience, and would gladly switch providers if Comcast had not monopolized the market."
"D of Huntsville, AL",42560,1,"I have had cable & internet service with Comcast/Xfinity for several months now. My internet service is constantly dropping. For about the past 1 1/2 to 2 months, I have been constantly resetting my modem or calling for them to send a signal. I have been on the phone with agents for nearly an hour at a time doing what they call a series of troubleshooting techniques. They finally scheduled a tech, which I'm told I may have to pay for. I just got off the phone with them again and they said no tech is coming... He was not scheduled. I have been waiting a week and now they want me to wait another 9 days to get a tech to my house. In the meantime, I am left paying $150 a month for service that I can not even use... But they want their payment on time or they'll shut me off. Oh but they did give me a 2 day credit like I was suppose to shout with joy over a probably $3 credit. Save yourself time and stress by getting service elsewhere."
"Gautam of Harrison, NJ",42559,2,"On 07/05/2016 night I saw smoke coming out of the coaxial cable outlet on the wall. That too when the cable box is NOT powered on and it's not connected to electrical outlet for more than 2 weeks. Coaxial cable outlet at Wall was hot and white cover plate turned yellow. I called 1800-Comcast for Customer Service Support. They DO NOT KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO AN EMERGENCY. Ms. NICKI told that ""Someone will call you back by 11:30 PM"" but no one called. Comcast did not send any emergency help. Rather than they suggested me to call PSEG whereas its coaxial cable which is burning. PSEG would do nothing since it's a cable issue. Using plier, I pulled cable out of the wall and metal piece is still fixed to wall outlet. The wall near outlet that was hot, started cooling down. Luckily nothing happened after that.During installation, a hole was punctured in the wall to bring the cable from alley to inside the bedroom. Not sure if that is the cause. If cable company is not taking ownership on the coaxial cable issue then who will? There is no electrical outlet close to that coaxial cable point at wall. On 07/06 morning, Ms Nicki called to see if someone called me. But nothing happened after that. I called back but could not get connected with supervisor for escalations. Had fire been caught up Comcast won't have any accountability since there is no proof after fire. All I wanted was a technician expert to come and open the Outlet and see what's going on. Someone has to see within the outlet if there was anything wrong. Then we can decide whose issue it is. When we open the cable outlet and if there is any damage done during the puncturing hole in wall Comcast should take ownership and fix it. But nothing happened next day except me calling and follow up out of my fear/panic mode. It happened second time in past 3 months. Since this cable box is powered off mostly, the issue goes unnoticed. First time the technician to fix the low signal strength issues and cable channel issues. He fixed the cable initially 2-3 months before. On 07/06 one technician comes and he says, ""I cannot fix this but my supervisor will call you."" Still no one called back. Rather than that I am calling and escalating again.On 07/07 during my call to 1800-Comcast, I asked for customer grievance cell or senior management for reporting my issue, but they have nothing to offer. After too much wait and insisting continuously, I was able to speak with Ms. EDONIE **, supervisor. She mentioned that someone will come on Saturday but I was not aware of that even. Then I insisted to get help today. She said she will try to send someone today. No one came. I call every day multiple times, spend easy 30 minutes to 1 hour in calls waiting/talking/escalating. There is no proper protocol that someone can come to house and fix the issue. I spoke with Mr. Bert or Mr. Kevin, I was told someone will come between 7-9 am but no one shows and I keep waiting on 07/08.On 07/08 Mr. Luis calls back in response to my survey after call to find out why I gave low rating on the call response or if services are restored. (No one cares about real issue but survey rating I guess that I got this call back from Comcast). Do you expect that there should be some definition of word EMERGENCY? It makes me terribly frustrated while talking to COMCAST CUSTOMER SERVICE, every time repeat the same story. Very unhappy experience with service since they did not understand the word ""Emergency"" and field/duty Supervisors are really careless as they don't care about this issue going so long."
"Kimberly of Lone Tree, CO",42558,1,"Got a letter in the mail claiming they had not been charging me for a box that I've had for over 5 years, so my monthly bill was going up $20, which would make my monthly service over $200/month, and this is for basic, nothing fancy! And this is after they took channels away from my package. Called to find out why they were going to start charging for something they've had record on for over 5 years. Turns out it's all just a ploy to make you switch over to the new system. Customer service rep was very rude! Told me my old system would not be supported any longer and that I would be getting a better service.I don't need anything better. I'm not that much of a TV watcher. I was very happy with what I have, and did not want to change, so she became upset with me because I told her that doesn't make sense, and I told her that was crap to charge me more for the same equipment I've had, and if it's old then why should I pay more? So she basically hung up on me and transferred me over to repair without telling me, and then the repair rep had no idea why I was transferred. She was super nice, and after a long conversation convinced me it would be better to switch to X1. But then, because I don't have internet with them, but I do have Wifi, I couldn't upgrade, but she also didn't know why I couldn't change. So today, I called another provider and will change service and get more channels and pay less."
"sagar of Maple Shade, NJ",42558,1,"I am really not satisfied with the Comcast customer care, and the store persons they are giving wrong offers while buying, and finally bill ends up high than what we expect."
"T. J. of Erie, CO",42557,1,"Was a Comcast customer for nine years. They would keep raising the price of the basic internet cost to the point that it was twice what a new customer paid for the same service. Comcast refused to give the same (or even close) price to a customer with nine-years of loyalty. ""Oh, you have paid your bills every month for nine-years? Great, you can pay us MORE than a brand new customer with no loyalty history with us!""Once I found I could tether off my phone and get the same data rates, but only have to pay $10 more per month for unlimited internet, I called Comcast again and again they refused to offer any deals on their lowest, basic service (always wanted me to ""bundle,"" but I don't own a TV and don't watch TV so have no use for anything other than basic internet), so I terminated their service immediately and haven't looked back. Every chance I get, I tell as many as I can about my experiences and have successfully steered a number of them to other services and away from Comcast, which I will continue to do. This company has no morals, no loyalty and treats customers like pond-scum. Good riddance to a bad company!"
"Danielle of Port St Lucie, FL",42557,1,"I have had the absolute worst customer service experience with Comcast! I was having problems with my On Demand for months, they could not fix it over the phone. Honestly they said they would send someone out. After the technician never showed the first time I rescheduled the appointment and then was charged $50 without my consent for a service fee! I am outraged by this fee especially since I was never told this would be charged to my account. They refuse to remove the charge."
"Tom of Stafford, VA",42557,1,"COMCAST is refusing to reissue a refund check in my mother's name, basing their decision on ""Corporate Policy"". I have come to the conclusion that COMCAST is seeking to KEEP the refund in order to maximize their profits. In short, my father passed away in AUG 2015 from the effects of Agent Orange during his time in Vietnam. Although he knew his time was short, he made sure all of his properties and accounts were ""shared"" with my mother. He did so to preclude my mom having to go through a Probate Court and/or establishing an Estate Account. The only item he did not foresee in his efforts was having all the bills in both their names. One of the bills which was solely in his name was his COMCAST account. Even though my mother cancelled service with this company, COMCAST refuses to issue refund checks in the name of the surviving spouses of former COMCAST customers. Instead of issuing refunds in the surviving spouses' name, they issue checks made out to ""The Estate of **"", knowing that the costs of establishing an estate account will far exceed the value of the refund. This allows COMCAST to enrich themselves from other people's misfortune. They did it to my mother, so we have first-hand experience in how they operate. Despite complaints to the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and FCC, COMCAST continues to hide behind ""Corporate Policy"" in order to keep the refund amount. After 30 years in the military and government service, I know that there's NO policy that can't be amended or overruled. We sent COMCAST a copy of my father's death certificate, showing my mother as the surviving spouse. We even offered to send COMCAST a copy of my father's will, showing that my mother is entitled to all property and monetary accounts. Even though my mother's refund is only $80.25, it's money COMCAST knows they'll likely never have to pay back; the cost of establishing an Estate Account exceeds the value of her refund. If it happened to my mother, I know it's happened to a few hundred other people throughout the United States over the years. COMCAST's attitude toward my mother's request for a refund in her name is reprehensible!! I will NEVER again be a COMCAST customer. I urge anyone with a COMCAST account to help --- please call them and ask them to change this stupid policy. I would anyone who's currently a COMCAST customer to cancel service with this inept and highly corrupt company."
"Frank of Houston, TX",42557,1,"I have been a customer for 20 years and have hated every day of it. The last straw was when I called to complain about outage. 2 service men came out and could not find problem. Then problem was found and a service man came out and fixed problem but left cable on top of ground and left without telling me. A neighbor came over to complain that a cable coming from my home was in their yard! I called Comcast and they said they would send someone out. Two days later I was leaving my home and noticed a big red new pick-up truck in my front yard. After all the rain we got weeks ago my yard was still soaked. The truck left a huge rut in middle of yard and broke my French drain that is buried 2 feet underground. The truck tire was buried half way or more to axle and I had no idea who this was. About that time a young man comes from the backyard and I asked why he tore up my yard and parked in it. He said he was from Comcast.I said ""Well that's good but why did you park your truck in my front yard? You could have parked on the street like everyone else up and down the 3 block."" He apologized and admitted fault and said he wasn't paying attention and let me take pictures of his truck in yard and said: ""Comcast would fix the damages. I am just a subcontractor for them."" I immediately called Comcast and they sent a claims adjustor out a few days later. I showed him the broken French drain, the rut in the yard. He took photos and I gave him photos of the sub-contractor, license plate and all and he said there would be no problem and it would be fixed because the contractor clearly was at fault. He even apologized for the carelessness of the sub-contractor.Next I got a letter from PremierCC of 6631 Cherry St., Houston, Texas 77092 saying ""there was no negligence on our part!"" There was no phone number. I tried to look up reviews and there was only 1 and it said it was no longer a BBB rated business and was likely closed. The letter was signed by ** but the envelope was hand written, sloppily I might add, with something that looked like a bugger on the face of the page-disgusting. Comcast is terrible. Deplorable. Every month it is something. I have complained to them numerous times. Neighbors tell me Dish is even worse so I have been tolerating. Last time I complained to the FCC and Comcast called me and begged me to accept free channels so I did reluctantly. They also promised to take care of me in the future. I guess this is their payback. I will not let this go. Worst company ever. Everyone who has a bad experience please call consumer affairs and the FCC.This company is a syndicate-a corrupt organization and needs to be shut down. They are squeezing the consumers. Strong arming us. They know we are over a barrel because they bought off the television stations who used to provide strong antenna service. Their movies are all re-re-runs and the ones worth watching we have to pay for. It is a racket! They have to be stopped!"
"Tyler of Nope Ln, PA",42557,1,"This company is a hard - 5/20 if it's even possible to be worse than the worst. Seriously, I hope someone reads these comments. If you know what's good for you, go with any other company other than them. They lie about your bill when you sign up, and it ends up being twice the original talked about price. God forbid the internet or cable ever works. It's like throwing $200 a month away. They don't care about their customers, everything from troubleshooting or a simple question is all done by an automated phone. They throw extra unknown charges on your bill, and charge you for things you never rented. God forbid THEY screw up your cable boxes. You get charged an extra arm and leg, even though it's their fault, then if you're like my family, you go weeks without cable because not a single person can help you with any of your problems. As soon as this contract is up I'm switching. Please go with ANY other company. Seriously save yourself the money and the headache."
"Joseph of Loveland, CO",42557,1,"A Comcast contractor with a trencher arrived at my neighbor's house this morning as my wife and I were leaving for an appointment. When we returned, we had no internet, phone or cable. I checked out back and the trencher went right up to the pedestal in my backyard cutting my cable. There is a state call before you law dig in Colorado and there was no locate before he dug. Upon calling Comcast customer service I think I got someone in India as I could only understand one word in five. She then informed me that I will have to wait until tomorrow to get it repaired. This is horrible customer service since they are the ones who killed my service. When my contract is up, I will definitely change providers, probably CenturyLink for internet and Sling TV for cable. This is about the fourth time I have contacted Comcast's customer service and all they ever do is tell me to reset the modem and it never fixes anything. We have had phone problems since we got Comcast."
"Sherri of Lawrenceville, GA",42556,1,"June 22, 2016 I talked with Jewelian **, a Comcast Sales Representative, a conversation that was over an hour. I decided to install internet, TV, and security, install scheduled for 7/2/2016. After several emails to Jewelian **, an attempt to nail down the Saturday install time, I continued to be told the details are being worked on. Friday, July 1, 2016 at 2:50 PM I received an email from Jewelian, informing me that there was no installer available and my appointments had been cancelled. Unfortunately, security is a priority and my 4th of July plans had been canceled so I could take care of this priority. Today, I talked with Ozar to determine what was happening to my install. I was informed that the dates I had were wrong, never was I promised an install of July 2, 2016. Maybe Comcast should return to the recording/emails and really find out what was promised. Believe I will take my service elsewhere!"
"Ray of Smyrna, TN",42553,1,"I have been a Comcast customer for 13 years (internet services) and recently add TV bundle. When I added the service I was very specific about asking billing information and what my first bill would look like as that was part of my decision as to making the switch from Dish Network to Comcast. When I opened my first bill from Comcast it is double what I was told it would be, so I called the 800 number and was advised there is nothing they can do. As a consumer I was not advised of all items listed on the bill and about certain portions of the bill that I was charged for. Comcast says they have a satisfaction guarantee but when you call them out on it they do not honor it. I have sent Neil Smit (Comcast President) an email and I doubt I will get a response, but we will see. I will also be call corporate on 7-5 as well to let them have it. I have never dealt with such an incompetent company as Comcast. All I am asking for is for them to honor what I was told or to cancel my service and owe them nothing. Either way I will not pay the double amount they are trying to charge me vs. what I was told. Neil Smith email came back as undeliverable. Not shocked though."
"M of Stuart, FL",42553,1,"Poor customer service, intermittent internet service, pixelation on TV, loss of sound."
"robert of Big Pine Key, FL",42552,1,"We have had Xfinity Comcast ""service"" for 3 years. Initially it took three visits for correct install, which should have warned us as to what was ahead for us. The recurring problem was suspending the service for the summer. You can't do it online. You must do it in person or by phone, so you have no written proof so naturally they keep charging you. Since I have direct pay I can only check to see if they are still billing you or you check your credit card bill and every year they still bill you until you find out, since after we stop service until two months have gone by. Which in our case is $300 plus they won't issue credit because they say we have no proof we called! They have admitted that we haven't used the internet from the time we ""allegedly"" called but still will not issue credit! They are totally crooked and supply lousy service too, slow internet and very expensive. We cancelled service. I will do without the TV and go to ATT who also suck."
"Kay of Conyers, GA",42552,1,"This week (6/27/16 to 7/1/16) has been a week from Hell for me in dealing with COMCAST. I'm going to try and shorten LONG story for you. On 6/24 (Friday) after many many sales call from COMCAST to my cell phone #. I agreed to their bundle offer - we have had COMCAST cable for years, landline and internet was with AT&T, so I knew bundle package would save us money. COMCAST tech was scheduled to come out to our house on Monday (6/27) from 3 to 5pm. I explained to COMCAST that I work and would not be home until around 4:30 or 5:00 pm - sales rep said NO problem tech could be scheduled to come around 4:30 or after 5pm with that time frame. Got home Friday and had a voice message from COMCAST on landline phone that Monday would not work so they rescheduled for Wed (6/29) from 3 to 5 pm.I called COMCAST customer service agent Friday (6/24) evening to confirm that I would not be home until 4:30 pm was told would not be a problem. Tech would be scheduled to come between 4:30 & 5:00 pm with that time. Just for my info I called COMCAST cust serv agent twice on Saturday to confirm this time frame and was told NO problem... received call on cell Monday (6/27) to confirm tech appt. I confirm with COMCAST cust serv agent about time frame was told NO problem.I called twice on Tuesday (6/28) to confirm tech appt for after 4:30 pm with time frame of 3 to 5 pm was told NO problem. On Wed (6/29) COMCAST tech shows up at house at 2:30pm with NO call to cell from COMCAST about arrival time, of course no one was available to let TECH in house. TECH sit in our yard for one hour and then left with no contact to my cell phone #... upon arrival home Wednesday (6/29) night found that landline and internet had been ported from AT&T to COMCAST without my knowledge so we had NO working landline or internet service because COMCAST had not left any of their equipment and/or info about internet service... found this out from calling AT&T about no internet service.Call BACK to COMCAST cust serv agent and demanded that my service be ported back to AT&T was placed on hold several times transferred to tech support on phone for 1 and a half hours with NO solution to problem. Finally on the evening of Thursday 6/30 (after COMCAST cust serv agent named William used the F word about me) was on HOLD with a supervisor for over two hours, was cut off and as of today (7/1) I still have NO internet service or landline working."
"Michael of Slc, UT",42552,1,We have a temporary internet cable that needs to be buried. My wife has scheduled to have them come three times and they have not come and not called to explain why. I called last night to talk to them and finally after being on the call 20 minutes the lady said someone would call me for what I thought was to set up a time for them to come. The guy called today and said someone would be calling in 24-48 hours to set up a time. I told him that's what the lady said. I would be receiving a call for within 24 hours and he said she meant that would just be when someone else would call to set up a time to bury the cable. Pathetic.
"April of Strasburg, CO",42551,1,"We recently moved to area that does not have Comcast. I was disappointed to have to disconnect because I've been a loyal cable client for 15 yrs. Today, I called to get my last two months of bills. They would not provide them to me online or via email since I've disconnected. They are suppose to be a top of the line internet and cable provider but cannot send an email with a customer's bill. All I want to do is pay my bill. Instead, I have to drive 35 to 40 min each direction to a service center to get my bill. What if I didn't live in a state that had a service center... crap out of luck. This experience has confirmed that I will NEVER use Comcast again."
"Issam of Modesto, CA",42551,1,As an online business we need non stop internet services and we do not get this at all. Almost daily it will show no service. I have been taking screenshots when this happens to maybe take them to small claims court as proof of lousy service. When you call them they want to send out a tech at your expense. I do not at all recommend Comcast Business Internet to any business.
"g of Cville, VA",42550,1,Comcast is the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with. They charge for service they do not provide or give. Randomly charged me for rented modem that was mine. The customer service people are absolutely the dumbest people on the face of the earth. The actual service is horrible. Cable constantly cuts out and internet is so slow I use my phone as a hotspot for my Apple TV. Please never use Comcast. 
"Teresa of Mableton, GA",42549,1,"Xfinity/Comcast should be ashamed at the poor level of customer service they provide to their customers. None of the reps you speak with have a clue about how to do their jobs. Although I know that it is a low paying position, Xfinity should invest in better training and development. There should be no reason a customer should be on hold for 45 min and transferred 4 to 5 times to only get NO help. I am Happily disconnecting my service and taking my business where it is appreciated. If you have other choices in providers please save yourself the headache to go elsewhere! You will be so happy you did! Xfinity is the WORST when it comes to customer service!!"
"Omar of Southfield, MI",42548,1,"Never ever get their service, randomly disconnecting service. I have their router so no problem would happen. I had an online exam and they just disconnected me for 3 minutes. I couldn't access the exam again. I called them to complain and the guy hang up on me. Never never have their service. #comcast"
"shiva of Marietta, GA",42548,1,I have been having issues with Comcast home security since the first day I got it. It's been two months and every day there is an issue with the home security not working somehow. Another night of not getting sleep because of Comcast. Their sensors are made so inadequate and cheap that they keep falling off and if they are not put back on the door the entire system would shut down and not working because it's showing one door is open. The other issue I have been having with this company is they overcharge me extra $10 every month and the customer services is very poor that no one would resolve the issue and they keep transferring you to another representative. For the past two months I have spend more that 5 hours dealing with them and getting nowhere and the worse part that I have a two years contract and they know I can't do nothing about it so no one in Comcast really cares.
"Vivian of Avoca, IN",42545,1,"I just sat on the phone for 36 mins. waiting to speak to customer service about my bill. In the last two days I've called them probably six times only to be told their servers are down, call back tomorrow. Every time I call, it's another 36 min. call. My bill is never what they quoted me, it's always around $200 range. Now they are unwilling to make payment arrangements with the less fortunate trying to get by. My husband has been out of work for 18 months with a bad back surgery and we are barely making ends meet. You would think a company this huge and greedy would work with us to make more money. I make a payment one week, and the next week they turn off the service! Not even a courtesy call to give us a heads up or give us a chance to scrape the money together to pay it. More than 50% of the time our cable doesn't even work on one of the TV's. NEVER would I recommend this company to anyone. If I had a choice, I would be on U-verse! But Comcast has the monopoly in my area. But I am definitely researching other options. Then Comcast can kiss me goodbye!!!"
"Emilien of Fort Pierce, FL",42545,1,Over charge every month. Crooks. Thiefs. $50 to $80. I have to call them every month.
"Megan of Miami, FL",42545,1,The departments are not aligned. One representative tells you one thing and the other tells you something completely different. I was being billed for equipment and service I didn't receive yet. I had to call 3 times within the first week and everyone seemed to just want to transfer me to a different department. The overall customer service is terrible. The expectations they set are not correct and the people working are incompetent.
"Tamyra of Issaquah, WA",42545,1,"I am writing to describe a terrible experience I had with Comcast today. I moved into this apartment about six months ago and have been trying to get working cable ever since. I reached out to Comcast, who, for at least the first 2 months was not able to locate the address (apartment UPPER was in their system, not Apartment B). Despite the people downstairs and the apartment to my right having Comcast cable, I was told that there was no address in the system. Turns out, several calls and multiple customer service reps later, there was an address for my unit, but it said apartment upper, not apartment B. Comcast was unable to fix this in the system but agreed to set up service. I had service connected, paid a deposit, and went to pick up my own boxes and router for install. I had trouble with install from day 1.Finally got the internet set up (after having to have a tech come out to install after all), then when I bought a tv and connected the cable box (about 60 days later), turns out the cable didn't work. I couldn't get my tv/cable box past the Welcome... connecting... screen. I scheduled one appointment. The window of time was between 2-6. I missed the guy though no fault of his own, so rescheduled. Rescheduled and was told the tech didn't need access to my unit, only to come home to a door tag that says, ""Sorry we missed you."" Scheduled service again with a tech between 4-6 pm, left work early, only to get home at 4:03 pm to find a door tag time stamped at 4:00 pm that said, ""Sorry we missed you!?!""I called Comcast to tell them I'd just walked through the door... it took THIRTY-FIVE minutes on hold, a hang up, call back, and two transfers for someone to come to the phone and tell me that the tech was no longer available and that I'd need to reschedule for a Saturday appointment. Of course the tech isn't available any longer... or even in the area probably! I've been trying to get through this - ""please press 1, please say your address, please let us know if you'll take a brief survey after your call"" automated system for almost an hour! At 10 til 5 pm I don't expect him to still be down the street. I did, however, expect a phone call when he arrived EARLY, and by 4 pm (the very start of the window) had already written and left a door tag.I tried expressing my frustrations to the person on the phone and he just sat in silence. I rambled on about how I felt giving someone a WINDOW of time, only to show up early, then leave before the window STARTED was poor customer service, but he sat silent. I asked if he was even listening to me and his response was, ""I am."" Monotone, zero concern for what I was going through... just more silence. I told him to please pass on my frustration, but I have no doubt that the guy really didn't care, hung up the phone with me, and moved on to the next caller. That's what prompted me to look online for a place to provide feedback.I wish I could make this review public and that there was an alternative to Comcast because service has been HORRIBLE since day 1, but this is the first site that showed when I did a Google search for Comcast Reviews, so here I am. I hope that someday this company can take all of these lengthy ONE STAR reviews and bad experiences and turn them around. I can't believe an organization this big doesn't care enough about it's paying customers to invest a LITTLE extra time and effort to make them happy. Geez."
"Robert of Stephens City, VA",42545,1,"I have been with Comcast for five years and want to get out due to poor to no service but they have an internet monopoly in the neighborhood. Their internet services and customer services can only be described as dysfunctional. The internet connection is very slow and often disconnects, so I spend more time turning the computer on and off than I am on it. I have tried to contact customer service and there is none to speak of. You cannot talk to a person. They do not get back with you on emails and will disconnect you from internet ""chatting"". Am looking into going off the net rather than renewing and having the poor service they provide at a current asking price of over $2,500 a year for internet, phone and TV."
"CJ of Fulshear, TX",42544,1,"This is the single worst customer experience I have ever had. My mother is 95 years old and has been a Comcast customer for many years. She had to relocate to an assisted living facility this month and therefore wanted to get new service including a telephone line with Comcast. She called Comcast to set up new service (which appeared to be very easy). She was told the account was all set for new service and an installation tech would be at the new address on June 11 between 1-3 PM. She was told to call an automated number to port her existing AT&T telephone number to Comcast, which she did. She was told that the port would take 3-5 days and don't disconnect AT&T 'til next week.On Friday, I phoned Comcast to confirm installation for Saturday and was told ""everything is set."" No one showed on Saturday. When we called on Saturday, we were told that installation was cancelled because they phoned my mom's old number and no one answered. She was already in the assisted living facility and not at home...I had given Comcast my telephone contact, but no one called me. By the way, this took about two hours of my time.I called back on Saturday to reset installation and was told that Comcast would be able to come back out on Tuesday, June 21. In the meantime, the AT&T account was disconnected as was the old Comcast account. DISASTER...Comcast cannot handle multiple accounts. They called back late in the week to say they could not come on Tuesday, but could be there on Monday. GREAT!! Then, they called back and said they cannot come on Monday after all, but need to come back on Tuesday. I have spoken with 10-12 different customer service people who have given me account numbers, different phone numbers, misleading information, incorrect information and generally the worst service I have ever experienced.Finally Comcast came on Tuesday and said they could not install the service as the line in the wall is dead in the apartment. I was told by the complex manager that Comcast actually did the installation, but the installer told me he could not do anything. Gosh, imagine my surprise...Comcast cannot help!! Somehow, the manager of the complex got in touch with Comcast and they came back today (Wednesday) and installed the cable, but not the phone as the technician said the line was not good enough to drive both the cable and phone and someone needed to fix it. When he left the TV was working ok.Now it is six hours later and there is a message on the screen to call to activate service. So, I called...spoke with six different agents, none of whom can figure this out. I had to get the serial number on the box and call back again...two more agents...another four hours on the phone. I am on hold as I write this and still no television service. The account number I was given is not valid. The address listed with Comcast shows internet service and not TV or phone...my mom does not even have a computer. If I were Comcast I would just close my doors.Comcast agent just came back on and said the box that was left by the installer is not a valid box, so someone will have to come back to reinstall another box. What in the heck is Comcast doing or thinking? This is not rocket science...they are the absolute worst at this business I have ever seen. I was concerned when my mom was starting new service as I had terrible experiences myself with Comcast. I had Comcast four years ago and had billing problems every month for almost 15 months...so when I moved, I made sure that Comcast was not my only option. IF you have any other option, do NOT use Comcast."
"Elizabeth of Melrose Park, IL",42542,1,"My cable TV is now off. Comcast took 321$ out of my account and sent me a bill for 745$ when it was only 460$ to begin with. Came, got the boxes, it's still off. I called about four time being hung up on. What can I do about this. They just take people money and they equipment."
"Victor of Coconut Creek, FL",42542,1,"When I moved to my new home five years ago, I dropped Comcast due to their horrible customer service. After a five year hiatus, I decided to give Comcast another chance, so I placed an order for their triple play service. I was told that the equipment would arrive at my house in five to ten business day. After the equipment failed to arrive I called to check on the status of my order. I was told that my order was canceled because I never completed the E-911 portioned of the transfer process. Comcast failed me for several reasons. They should have completed the process the same day that I call (I later found out that is not a very long process). It was never explained to me that I needed to complete this portioned part of the process for the order to be completed.The frustrating part was that I asked ""Is there anything else I need to do today?"" The rep told me no. Also they should have called my cell phone not my home number as I told them to use my cell number as my primary means of contact. I also think that they should have sent an e-mail message about me needing to call them and finishing the process. I also asked if I could pick up the equipment, I was told no. I came to find out that I could have pick up the equipment whenever I wanted. At this point we are not to a good start because they are not providing me with the right answers to my questions. Despite my frustrations I decided to give them another chance. I placed my order again (it took a whole 90 seconds to complete the E-911) and went to the store to pick up the equipment.As I pick up the modem and the cable boxes I asked the rep, ""Does anyone has to come to my house to connect the wires to your system?"" The replied was, ""No sir, all you have to do is connect the boxes and call this number."" I went home and took my AT&T system out and plug the Comcast system up. I call their number and they tell me that I have to wait until Wednesday to connect my internet because they have to send someone to my house to connect the cable located on the outside of my house. Look I tried to be reasonable here. The problem is that I asked very specific questions in order to asses my responsibilities and to better plan and prepare. If they would have told me that they can connect my internet until two days from now I would have waited as to not interrupt my TV and internet services. I just think that the information should be provided by them and If I asked the questions the right answers should be given.I contacted their costumer service and complaint. The only thing I wanted to hear was that they would send someone to connect my cable. They said that they could not do it. I later received an email with the offer for them to send a technician and connect their services. By the time I received the email (which was fairly fast) I had already drove back to the store and returned their equipment. Comcast your customer service should not be measured by how nice people are. It should be measured by how competent they are at their job. I feel like I a dodged a bullet. I would not recommend anyone to get their services. They are just very incompetent."
"Timothy of Jonesboro, GA",42542,1,"We recently moved and requested a transfer of service with Comcast/Xfinity. They sent someone out the next day to connect our service, but things suddenly grew complicated. We were told that the ""job could not be completed"" due to the fact that ""a bucket truck was needed to get up the pole."" Customer service was called by the technician and they stated that within the hour a bucket truck would come to go up the pole. Needless to say, the bucket truck never came. Customer service was called again by me to inform Xfinity that our services were never connected. Customer service set up another appointment for five days later, for a bucket truck to come out. They also ""notated on the account that it was necessary for a bucket truck to come out"" in order for services to be completed. Day five finally came around and another regular technician showed up. He stated that he was ""debating on doing the job"" because he was not equipped to climb the pole, then he just left. Customer service was then called a third time for someone to connect our services. Another appointment was set for five more days later. Needless to say that at this point I'm frustrated and ready to switch to DirecTV! Once again Xfinity sends a regular technician out who is unequipped to connect my services! Now I just spoke to customer service one day prior to my appointment to confirm that they would first send a bucket truck, in order for the regular technician to complete the job in-house. Why is this so complex for Xfinity/Comcast to get right? My neighbor's service was transferred two days after they moved in with no problems, and did I mention that they have DirecTV. So maybe it's time for a change. Very dissatisfied with Xfinity/ Comcast."
"Shelley of Pompano Beach, FL",42542,1,"We had a bad storm when cable stopped working. For over a week they sent refresh signals then had us go exchange boxes. To no surprise, none of it worked. Cable worked intermittently. Made appt for tech to come check our terrace lines. Took off work losing money for tech appt. Tech came, said we weren't paying for our dvd. Said he had to call office before he continued. Cable started to work on 1 tv so my husband went out to tell him as he was driving away. He told my husband he was driving out back to check signal online. When he never came back we call Comcast and to our surprise the automotive service said we had appt for this Wednesday between 8 and 10. I got a tech on phone and she gave me a supervisor who argued with me saying he set a new appt unknown by us. She sent us to a complaint dept where she also stood up for the tech who obvious didn't want to work and said he was only a inside tech not a line tech. We set the appt knowing it was in the line duh? Then she offered to keep appt and give me $25 off service fees. Hello!! I lost a day of work about $150 and she wants me to lose another day and then say we have to pay to have it fixed!!! I looked it up and they are responsible for their lines. BS!!In the meantime we have to pay for cable we haven't had. So I can't afford another day off for at least a week and they aren't even offering to credit our bill. This isn't the first, 10th time we have been through this with them and if I have to take off work again it won't be for them. We are done!! I'm getting a different time service! We pay 180 per month for just cable and as many problems in the past year they should be paying me when I have only had service half the time. Something needs to be done with this company and it pretty much sucks that they are the only company beside satellite TV! Which is awful in Florida with the storms!!!"
"C. W. of Pembroke Pines, FL",42541,1,"I am a subscriber of the Comcast Internet, Cable and TV services. I consistently experience dropped service and have spoken to Comcast representatives on numerous occasion. I have in the past year have two of their best technicians come to examine my home since the problem apparently cannot be resolved. The most recent was here in March and changed some wires that are feeding the service. Latter part of 2015 a different tech came out and changed some wires on the outside box; yet the problem continues where I have number of down time. Today while speaking to a rep, she said it is giving her a message that I should contact the modem/router manufacturer, yet when the previous reps were here that suggestion was never made. I was told something seem to be blocking the signal strength. Not sure who to complain to about this horrible service and high price I am paying monthly to be frustrated. Sucks!!! One tech suggested I purchase a wifi extender but if there is no signal what's the use of the wifi extender. I was told I am being charged for the visit because it is not a Comcast modem."
"Kori of Naples, FL",42541,1,"Where to even begin! On June 7th, I received a ""courtesy call"" from Comcast stating that someone had called to begin service in my apartment and they wanted to know when I was moving out. I told them I'd be moving out on June 21st and would like my services turned off on June 20th. This seemed all well and good at the time. My bill was paid for that billing cycle up to June 17th so I figured I would just pay for the 17th-20th. My monthly bill is $54. On June 10th, my services were disconnected. I called to inquire as to the problem and was told that they had disconnected my account because that is the day I'd asked for it to be turned off. When I told her that was incorrect, she stated that she needed to create an entirely new account for me but this would not cause any issues with service or billing. It is now June 20th, the day before I'm moving out, and I just noticed that there are 2 accounts in my name and both have been charged for cable and internet since the new account was open! I was being told that I owed $28 on my old account which had been previously disconnected by Comcast (and was already paid for) and $63 for the new account! The representative did not credit me for the week that I had left on my previous account's billing cycle that had already been paid for. They did credit the $28 on the account as it was their error and canceled the account completely. However, I'm now paying almost $10/month more on this new account without receiving credit for what had already been paid for on the previous account. I have HAD IT with this company!!! What a bunch of scam artists! And they have a monopoly on the service in my area so I was stuck with them if I had any hope of communicating with the outside world via my TV or computer. If you are able to find another ISP, DO IT! Stay as far away as possible from these crooks!"
"Maria of Pembroke Pines, FL",42541,5,"I was in shock when I was greeted as soon as I entered.

This never happened before in the years I have been coming to Comcast. And for me to write a review means it was worth it. Thank you (Comcast employees) for making my day beautifully."

"Grant of Marietta, GA",42539,1,"I have two complaints: 1. My channels keep switching to Spanish, or the ads go silent, or they suddenly think I am blind and a voice provides commentary on what the actors are doing. My latest ""On Demand"" movie arrived in Spanish, and I am unable to find any way to get it fixed or get a credit. I have contacted them before to get these constant ""pop up"" issues fixed, but they keep reoccurring! 2. TRY TO MOVE! I have tried using the online site and calling COMCAST. There is no option for ""just moving"". The only option is to provide a new address to transfer the account. I tried their ""chat with an expert"" option. 20 minutes later, still no one answering my questions. They are the worst."
"F. C. of Sarasota, FL",42539,1,"Intermittent to no internet service at all for over a week. 1 technician came. He did NOT do a proper root cause analysis. Change a small portion of cable. Force me to change modem (which was less than a month old) and the problem re-occurred less than a week later. One Comcast online tech admitted that Comcast cannot handle the internet traffic. Avoid Comcast as cable service provider, not worth $66.95 a month. Mr Roberts, CEO of Comcast has no understanding of customer service and he should start reading ""Like A Virgin, Secrets They Won't Teach You at Business School"" by Richard Branson if he wants to retain business/retain his job."
"Kevin of Savannah, GA",42538,1,"I had a cut cable wire outside next to the cable box, I spent over a week everyday on the phone with Comcast reps, supervisors, and managers trying to get repair service. I was continuously made broken promises by all reps. Two appointments that I had to wait all day (8 am-8pm) were no shows, and I once again had to call, be put on hold, transferred to other agents who just said sorry, and agreed with me of the poor service people were receiving. Finally after over a week of time consuming phone calls and promises from Comcast someone came by to fix it. Well that was sad also. The girl knew nothing about the problem of the outside cable being sliced, and told me all she knew was the cable wasn't working. She didn't even fix the entire cable, all she did was put out a new line of cable and duct tape it to the old one, and then started to just leave.I stopped her and asked why the new cable was just laying on the ground all over my yard and gardens. Her response was, ""I don't bury cables, you have to get another appointment for someone to do that"". She said, ""I set you up one, don't know when they will be out. should be within a week or so. But I don't have a confirmation number or anything to give you. Just call the company."" So I did, and they had no record of her making an appointment to have all the orange cable wire buried, and they were shocked that she left the site as she did not completed. SO... I made another appointment to have someone come out to finish the job. We'll see how that goes. I'm sure I'll get the run around again. I have no faith in Comcast, and do not suggest anyone using them if at all possible. They are very unprofessional, and do not keep their appointments most of the time. And yes they will lie to you every chance they get."
"carol of Rolling Meadows, IL",42537,1,"FED UP with this company - have paid between $150 & 325 EVERY month since last June for min. service/no extras - & somehow, I have bal. of 336? HOW? Phone crackles - can't use; internet split between too many users (hospital, schools, developments, etc.) -almost useless; & TV suddenly goes dead in the middle of the night & has to reboot. When I call for service, it's always ""YOUR equipment, home, location"" blah, blah, blah - whatever excuse they can come up with. Moving to AT&T - can't be any worse, and at least I'll know what to expect when the bill comes. RIDICULOUS - the only thing they're good at is billing!"
"Jamie of Winchester, TN",42536,1,"My experience with their customer service was horrible as I had spoken with 6 different reps about my internet and needing help getting the Gateway Installed. Keep in mind, my internet was working prior. They said the Gateway was not working and they needed to send a technician to my house. I told them since I had to do that, I would like to turn my old modem back on so I could get connection back. They said it did not work... It worked 30 minutes prior!! I said this is bull crap and I need someone asap. The 2nd tech said wait by the phone and she would call back in 10 minutes. She NEVER called back. I called again, got 3 rep and she said someone would be at my house on Sunday between 2 & 4. No one ever called so I called a 4th time. They said they would check and call me back. They never called back.I called a 5th time and they said someone was coming Tuesday between 2&4. I told them from the beginning I had to work and no one would be there!! They seemed to let that fly over their head. I finally said ok. Sat early! The techs came and did get my internet going but they left with my router, WHICH WAS MINE!! Now I have called them again, and am getting nowhere! Also, they are charging $10 modem plus the Gateway charges and I don't even have the modem either!!! My experience was so horrible, I felt as though I was about to have a nervous breakdown!! My heart was racing and I began having a panic attack! When you call Comcast, it requires you to speak to the automated system out loud. When I am at work I cannot speak out loud, especially when the automated operator does not understand what you are saying. That really makes my blood boil. You can't call anyone local, their numbers are all linked to one number.Even the technicians said they get complaints all the time. Plus they said they do not work on Sundays which confirmed that the Cust Serv. Replied. ""I am begging someone to do something to regulate this company."" The number of complaints should tell the story. They are pointed at the Customer Service. I have thought about suing for mental distress because, when you pay for a service and you do not get it through no fault of your own, someone needs to be held accountable. I feel for everyone who has experienced the same problems as I have. I am NOT the only one!!!"
"Dani of Perkasie, PA",42532,1,"Brief summary: I live with my brother. Comcast account in his name, I am authorized, I pay the bill. Sometimes he does not give me the bill so have been late here and there. Recently called and paid. They took my money then turned off service the next day. I call, they apologize and turn it back on. I argue there better not be a reconnect fee. They said of course not. Well next few month there was an odd charge of $3 which I asked and they gave me some BS. When I added it up it totaled a reconnect fee... go figure.Fast forward and missed payment. Called, set up arrangement, shut service off. Called, turned it on. Next day, shut service off. Called and told them the arrangement. Had the rudest female ever who said rep should not have done that, turned service on and argued would not be paying 2 reconnect fees. She said, ""Not my problem. Speak to another department"" and ended call. Bogus charges showing on bills. Worst customer service EVER."
"mrs. antonio of Anywhere, IL",42530,1,"For the past two weeks, we have been getting texts saying there is an outage for internet in our area and horrible internet service because of it. When we try to call about it, the ""customer relations morons"" refuse to do anything more than simply record our complaint. When you ask for a supervisor, you get a corporate parrot that only knows how to recite policy and can't do anything more than squawk. At least a dozen phone calls over the past 24 hours and still no answers. Asked if they could at least send someone out to check on our lines and they said they can't send anyone because there's an outage. No kidding??? Even tried to contact the corporate office and they were worse. When you get upset, they tell you they're recording you like I care. I'm not getting paid to do a job. They are and they suck at it. It's high time someone breaks up the cable company monopolies!!"
"clif of Denver, CO",42530,1,"Nothing special here folks. Just another complaint that Comcast sells services, then attempts to raise rates by sending a letter stating you were on a promotion but the promotion is up and prices too, then they won't honor the original prices or terms. The really horrible thing here is that Comcast admits this is a typical business practice (misrepresenting the contract) that they use for their sales. How do they live with themselves? This is just a ""bait and switch"" like you'd expect from some thief on the street with three shells and a folding table. Who in the heck is supposed to be regulating these creeps?"
"SANDRA of Plainfield, IL",42529,1,"Unfortunately I find myself having to share my very unfortunate experience with my cable and Internet provider ""Comcast"". I always viewed the people who took the time to complain as frustrated consumers and with too much time on their hands. Well... I must say that my frustration has brought me here today. I have been a loyal customer of Comcast for six years and have had nothing but one problem or another. From the Internet service, the cable service, along with the billing and no one at Comcast is able to get it right.I was recently was contacted by a Comcast/Xfinity rep and was advised that Comcast was upgrading the terminal boxes in my area. She explained that it would be a quick swap. She needed to know what day and time would work best for me. Due to my busy schedule I tried to accommodate the best as possible. We agreed on the following week. She explained that my technician would call me before he arrived to make sure I was home to complete the swap. After 3 long unexpected hours of installation (It was supposed to be a Š—“quickŠ— swap) the technician finally left. A week later, I then receive my bill reflecting a higher amount than my normal billing. Here is the run down...I called on a Saturday, spoke to billing and was told that the increased amount was due to a new box that was installed (I never contacted Comcast. I was contacted by them). A box I NEVER requested. The rep promised someone would call me back to resolve the issue. Being that no one contacted me on that next Monday I took upon myself to call them on Tuesday. After the long recorded menu I was able to get a rep in the billing department. He claimed he could not assist me with this issue and was transferred to someone in technical support. The gentleman in technical support explained it was a billing issue, he could not assist me with my issue. After going back and forth I requested to be transferred to a supervisor or a higher up. I was finally transferred to a young lady who had the courtesy to listen and help me out but not resolve my issue.In order to resolve the billing issue I was requested to swap boxes again so I would not continue to get charged. I was asked to return the box that was recently installed at a local Comcast location and swap it out with a box like I had before. I was told that I myself would have to install it... Really? I believe that I should have been advised initially of any extra charges for swapping boxes and clearly I was not. I was never made aware that it was an option to me. I wish the rep who called me to swap boxes had advised correctly. Instead I was told that this was normal procedure for all Comcast customers as Comcast was upgrading their equipment. Then they charge me for it. FRAUD!Last May I had planned a gathering at my home to watch a fight. I ordered the event and it never came through. I had to take my guest to a local bar and felt obligated to pay their cover charge since it was Š—“myŠ— provider that had failed. After speaking to Comcast rep about this issue they removed the charge for the fight and I was told that I would be compensated with HBO and Showtime for 2 years for only $1 each. I agreed. BIG NIGHTMARE with my billing!! As you can imagine I found myself calling 3 months in a row until they finally got my billing right. Unfortunately after I thought the issue was all cleared I then find out that Comcast didn't honor their promise of keeping both premium channels for $1. DISAPPOINTED AGAIN!Following that incident I'm having Internet issues. At this point I asked that my son be an authorized person to talk to as I no longer want to deal with Comcast reps. My son was told the problem would be resolved. Nope, not resolved! After more Internet issues I felt it was time to cancel and go with a different cable provider. I tried canceling 2 times and was suckered into better deals each time. Being such a creature of habit it sounded more convenient each time to stay with Comcast. BAD IDEA!A few years ago when I was having Internet issues Š—“againŠ— they had to send a technician out as they could not figure why I was having so many issues. After the technician was done fixing the issue at my home he explained that the modem Comcast had provided was not registering because it was never connected properly. He explained that the serial number on my modem did not match the one on my account. He basically told me I had no internet and I was using my neighbors internet the whole time. I then called Comcast to request a refund for the service they did not provided me and was declined a full refund. I was charged for over a year of internet service Comcast NEVER provided me. FRAUD!Unfortunately we rely on such a monopolized service provider and as consumers we suffer the consequences for their poor service as they continue to take our hardworking money. I have never been so disappointed and disgusted with any provider in the past. I feel cheated and abused by Comcast, a provider who unfortunately has the power to do so. I will continue to share my experience with Comcast with other sites and social media until Comcast takes control of their poor service."
"Yolanda of Little Rock, AR",42528,1,"Okay, I had this technician come out about 2 weeks ago to hook up my Xfinity voice and internet service. He goes out back and sees my small garden blocking the area he had to work. So instead of avoiding my plants, this fool pulls up my wooden border and tosses it in the yard. He also stomped on all my plants like they weren't there. The wooden border is heavy with about 3 or 4 large nails sticking out. The thing was in my yard with the nails up... Anyone could have come through and stepped on it or tripped on the log. My son is the one who found it and informed me after he had left.Also, before he finished work at my house and before my son discovered the mess made outside, he left and said he had to go elsewhere to finish another job then come back to my house. He left and came back 45 minutes later then had the nerve to sit on my couch for 10-15 minutes saying he had to wait until a certain time to ""clock in"". WTF? So, you're gonna sit in my house watching TV until it's time to work? Really? I called Comcast and filed a complaint. I was told I would hear something after Memorial Day. I still haven't and I don't think I will because they just don't give a damn. But they had my bill posted to the account 2 days later."
"D of Eustis, FL",42527,1,"If there was an option for less than one star - I would have selected that. I am now on my 4th call regarding my service. Today's customer service rep was very rude & condescending and appeared agitated at the onset. She hung up on me vs. saying ""one moment"", ""thank you"", etc. Last week I was on the line for more than 72 minutes - to subsequently learn (during call 3), that I did not receive the service discussed. My average monthly bill for fairly basic service is more than $200. The problem is that Comcast doesn't strive to be better or competitive - because of the very limited options to the consumer."
"Jorge of Portland, OR",42527,1,"I want to start with the fact that I only got Comcast because the building I moved into had a contract with Comcast so I did not have the option to get DirecTV who I used to have and loved! Once I got my equipment around the 17th of the month, I set it up and within one week I got a bill for $60 more than what they quoted me. When I talked to them they said that was for fees related to setting up my account even though I picked up the equipment and set it up myself. Since I didn't realize that they sent me a bill within one week because I discarded it as welcome mail became past due and by the time I got the next bill they already had shut off my service for being late on the first payment.When I called and made the payment they said that Comcast always bills ahead for the full month and they always charge for self installation, they said if I would have had someone come over it would have been $70 so it's considered a discount that I am paying to install it myself! I laughed it off and then they said that I still owed $12 as a late fee for the second month even though I had just paid the full balance it asked for online. When I asked why it didn't say I owed it online they said it will be on my next statement in two weeks but if I wanted my service back on I needed to pay the $12. I understand $12 is not a lot of money but the attitude the service rep had and the fact that it didn't state it online bothered me, so I asked if he really was going to not restore my service over $12 that has not been billed yet after I paid over $200 and he very matter of fact said yes.I and asked to speak to a manager, after being on hold for a few minutes he transferred me to the automated line and within a minute my service was back on. This is what Comcast customer service looks like. I say avoid them at all costs and if you are moving into an apartment complex that has a contract of exclusivity with Comcast I would say seriously reconsider. I am probably going to pay the early cancellation fee and not have cable. There are so many other sources these days for it that I don't need it!"
"Ariel of Dunwoody, GA",42524,1,"What they tell you your bill will be monthly IS A LIE! Before you know it, you will have a bill that exceeds $300 a month. DO NOT LET THIS FRAUDULENT CABLE COMPANY FOOL YOU. The bill is NEVER THE SAME. When you call and ask why the sudden change, the reps end up as clueless as you are. I can guarantee you that your monthly bill will increase every month."
"Carole of Milton, MA",42523,1,"Comcast for some reason credited our account for 1704.00 for 3 months in which time I was receiving bills saying No Payment Due but they then reversed the credit and billed me for all 3 months at once. Not sure if this is legal but contacted Customer Service and he just kept saying, ""I have no idea what happened but your bill is correct now,"" so I contacted Corporate Office. They stated that someone would call me by the end of the day in which they didn't, so I called again today got a woman who said, ""Well your issue was resolved. The credit was an error so we have fixed your account and you now owe the three months you weren't billed for."" I asked her how their mess up was fair to us. She said, ""Well it's your bill and you owe it! It was a mistake and it has been dealt with. It was done in error. I don't know who did it and why but it's over.""They are without a doubt the worst Company to have to deal with!!! They should be investigated because they do things that are so illegal... i.e. calling and leaving lengthy messages regarding overdue bills stating how much is owed and what will happen if you don't pay the overdue amount, yet when I called to complain about that I was told that ""FINE we will put you on the do not call list and if your phone gets shut off don't blame us"" and then dial tone!!! RUDE and illegal leaving personal information on an answering machine when again I called Corporate they stated they don't go by Mass Laws... Really I guess they are special..."
"M. H. of Zumbrota, MN",42523,1,"Fixing billing mistakes when I first signed up for Comcast required multiple 30+ minute phone calls with corrections that were confirmed on the phone not occurring thereafter. Billing cannot be redone in real-time in the sense that if you were overbilled, the customer is promised a refund next month but must pay the inaccurate and larger bill the month the mistake occurred. Finally, cancelling service required over 45 minutes, speaking to 3 customer representatives, and then was not done, leading to further charges on the account and a continued cycle of customer service calls."
"Tauika of Waterbury, CT",42522,1,"So I've been a DirecTV customer for many years and decided it was time for a change. I switched to Xfinity/Comcast under the assumption services would be better and more reasonable, boy was I wrong. I was asked for a $100 deposit that would be credited back to my account after the first year. Upon receiving my first bill, I was billed 2 months in advance and my deposit was gone. I called in to try to figure out what the problem was and also because I was within my 30 days to cancel and had been receiving promotional products in the mail that was at a cheaper price. Long story short, I was given the run around and offered premium channels free for 6 months I guess to shut me up and told that my deposit was used for installation fees. 3 months later one of my receivers stop working. After spending a large amount of time on the phone, the end result was return the receiver the next day and try again. I went and exchanged the receiver, still nothing. I think maybe it's the remote, I went and got a new one - still nothing. I get back on the phone with Comcast, I was told a tech would have to come out because that receiver apparently wasn't receiving a signal from the main one. So after another $37 and some change charge added, the only thing I had to do in the first place was exchange the main box. I could have done that myself for free. Why not just tell me instead of having me let strange folks walk through my house and fix a problem that I could have solved 24 hrs ago? Then when I asked for credit for my box not working, I was told $1.59 was credited to my account for the day and a half it was down. I understand everybody has to work but ripping people off to make money isn't right."
"Carmen of Vero Beach, FL",42522,1,Comcast is the worst cable company. They charge you all these extra fees and on top of that you have to pay an expensive bill. I have one box and my cable with from 50 dollars to 343.60. What kind of ** is that. They should be ashamed of themselves. Besides AT&T doesn't even charge that much.
"kenny of West Palm Beach, FL",42521,1,"After more than 10 in person contacts, chats, emails, phone calls... with COMcast (communistcast) about what I get vs what I pay for, I had to go the FCC complaint route to get the Ogre to look my way and address the still unresolved problems I have. I feel like a nat bug flying in the face of the beast and being swatted away as if I am just an annoyance to the ever money hungry service monopoly monster. Every time I make contact with it, it seems my bill goes up.A key problem with my service is, I pay for HD reception. One would expect that the cable box provided, as it is required to received service, will allow it. After 3 technician visits, I got the answer why I don't get full hd. I was told by the last tech visiting me that the box ""required"" to get it is the high end DVR one, only. No other cable box they provide will give full 1080p or better reception. This is an intentional corporate misrepresentation, no counter, phone or chat agents were aware of this fact in my conversations. The best I can get is 1080p, ok but nowhere near as good as it could be. If I had a newer 4k or better tv I would probably have complained to the tv maker thinking there is something wrong with it only to find out the signal I get doesn't provide. Remember when your dvd and blu-ray movies looked awesome on your low tech tv? Over the years, the tv and movie disk makers have compressed the signal/content which reduces quality, making you want the newer better picture quality models. Comcast seems to do the same thing with their video signal, forcing you to want their higher end service and pay through the nose for it.After posting my FCC complaint I got a call/voice mail from a Crystal ** of Florida Executive Customer Relations within 2 days. I also chatted with a supervisor online who promised to send me the dvr box that would allow 1080p, even an email to confirm its shipping, but even after 5 days the tracking # given doesn't say anything more than a label was created and no return call from Crystal. Since I already feel like I've been patronized so they can get to the next complaint, my assumption is more calls/chats will be needed and not have permanent resolution. If I want faster than a snail internet service, I am forced to use Comcast, as they have a monopoly over my area. I cannot use a dish, and that's another can of worm service fixings by providers. The infrastructure is there, why isn't it usable by any provider instead of just 1 predetermined company?"
"Ronald of Colorado Springs, CO",42520,1,"Salesman came to door, told him to let me call him next day after talking with wife about current company agreement. He agreed, gave me a business card with his cell # on it. I called him following day and said we have to wait 2 months but then I would try it. Salesman put the order in anyways and a box of equipment showed on my doorstep. I never opened anything, unwrapped, or untied any of the equipment. I check on my computer to see what it said, showed a new service bill of $122.00. I took off work early to take the equipment to the Xfinity store in colorado springs. The staff person said my account was cleared and Xfinity was about to do away with salespeople being paid regardless if the account was activated. 3 days later I checked online and this time it said I owed $23.00. So for a second time I had to go to the store, employee said he entered me a credit and quote ""You shouldn't order anything from our door salespeople"". Ok, so again for one, I never ordered it, and two, the staff comments and answers are plain ridiculous and insulting. Any plan or thoughts I might have had of signing up with this company in July are long gone. As far as I'm concerned they owe me money for wasted time talking to salesperson at my door and 2 trips to their store."
"ann of Fl, FL",42520,1,"Punch yourself in the face and it will be less painful than dealing with their foreigner customer service reps. I spent three weeks dealing with their scripted ** to get a refund on overcharges that were ""guaranteed"" seven times to happen within 48 hours. It took a complaint to the Better Business Bureau to get an INSTANT refund. I did get a call from an ""executive"" who basically gave the same type of lame excuses for poor customer service. I'm not complaining about the service of the cable/internet at all, but their customer service is the worst I've ever dealt with. Please don't hesitate to call the BBB...as that will be the only way you will get satisfaction."
"Brian of Mount Holly, NJ",42519,1,"Replaced box again with a DVR box because that's all he had. Again we didn't order or want DVR. Since this all began we have had 3 boxes in total. Bill has been wrong every month except the 1st month. We finally got the correct box however still this month's bill is over $100.00. I hate these people. The amount of time we've spent on the phone with them and service calls the past few months is insane. I do NOT recommend them in the least. If you have any other cable alternatives in your area, I highly suggest you use them. My only other option was Dish and I don't want Dish. I wish Verizon was an option for me."
"Renee of Nutting Lake, MA",42518,1,"I have been a customer for nearly 2 years. This companyŠ—Ès ONLY time of good prices is for the initial time period of a contract. After that the shake down begins, but also the service is HORRENDOUS!!! Very intermittent, never at the level that you are promised, but they charge you for it and brag about themselves as if their ads matter more than what they deliver. They beat you into submission because the only alternative is to block out five plus hours of your day for an incompetent technician to show up and basically change NOTHING... I know that most of the people using Comcast have no other choice or they wouldn't be here using it. This is the way it is. Like mafia the companies each mark out their territories and do their shakedowns... This is the one thing you can rely on with their services. You will be shaken down... period.Their service sucks. It is advisable to be very creative in your search for services before getting involved with them. It will become a headache you wish to avoid in no time at all. Wait lines for complaints are so long. This way the majority of us hang up before they have to be accountable... and like I say their technicians haven't got a clue what they are doing so a visit to your house is just a reminder of who is in charge so long as you are getting service from them.There are no basic services that are affordable. All there are is supposedly discounted services for the first year, which are high even to begin with, and then they trump up to ridiculous levels as the contract runs out. If only what they promised was what you got, but it isn't and trying to explain that, or get credits for it, well you have to put up with more home visits from their incompetent techs before they even talk to you about it. Their business relies on your not having a backup plan or ability to switch out. Don't go with this company. Try some creative start up. They just want your money through whatever creative means they can get it. Their services suck and are nothing to rely on, and nothing like as advertised!!!"
"Sj of Naples, FL",42518,1,"Spoke to a customer service rep 2 days ago and set up service for today 05/28/16 between 1pm and 5pm. Waited for service or at least a phone call till 4:20pm when I finally called into Comcast to ask about service man's whereabouts. Spoke with a young lady and she stated technician came to my home at 1:38pm. Huh? He knocked on door and then called me. Again huh? Roommate, dog and I never heard doorbell ring and I never got a call from technician. My dog was roaming free in yard and would have barked at anyone she didn't know on my property. Let alone a Comcast van pulling into my fenced driveway out in rural Golden Gate!!! It had just quit drizzling rain so maybe the tech didn't want to work?Lovely woman on phone then stated that unknown ghostly service man notated that I had to have a new cable line run because box was 250 feet away? Huh? I live in a rural area however I had service with Comcast in 2014. Lines were previously run and my home is 125 feet off the center crown of the asphalt road and MAIN telephone pole they run service off of is approximately 150 feet from cable box on west side of home. HOWEVER my neighbor currently has Comcast and there is a telephone pole between our 2 homes and Comcast previously ran cable and internet off THAT telephone pole which is approximately 35 to 40 feet away from my cable box.I get the impression the technician did not want to work late today and choose to falsify his paperwork on this potential installation. I asked when they would send someone else and of course since it is 5 pm on Saturday and Monday is Memorial Day it would be Tuesday between 8am and 8pm?? Wow! What horrendous customer service. I can honestly see now why I dumped their service 2 years ago. Technicians that don't show up then lie about it and then I'm going to potentially be charged for adding new lines when lines are already there or can be run off neighbors and my existing pole and box??? I'm very disappointed to have waited all afternoon for nothing. And it appears Comcast doesn't give a damn about my time waiting. And then to find out they are going to probably try and charge me for a quote ""250+"" foot line installation is bogus!!! WOW! How is Comcast still in business?"
"Geek of Kennesaw, GA",42517,1,"A year and a half ago, I moved to my new residence and after having Comcast for 7 years, I unfortunately had to do away with the service as Directv was already installed in the residence. Fast forward to two weeks ago. I had the opportunity to choose my provider and called Comcast. In order to save money, I put myself on a fixed monthly budget, so I explained to the CSR what how much I would allocate to a bundled service or just internet and cable. I also explained to him that I was willing to reduce channels just to get my monthly payment where it needs to be. As he tried to sell me more items and I continued to decline, he started getting frustrated. I thought I had made it clear right from the start what my budget was. In the midst of his frustration, he let out a LOUD YAWN. That did it for me!! I hang up and called Directv reconnect services."
"Juan of Hialeah, FL",42517,1,"I have problem with COMCAST, I am a old customer and COMCAST give me a higher bill every day. I think If we are a old customer and we always have paid good, comcast could give me the same bill for the same service because my salary is the same."
"Jenna of West Hartford, CT",42516,1,"I recently had to cancel my account with Comcast due to moving to a new location that does not offer the service. Since I still had time on my contract I was charged an early termination fee. I felt this was not fair to charge me $200 for something that I had no control over (their services not offered). I called to attempt to get this fee waived and was told that it was a legitimate charge and there was nothing I could do about it. At no point when I was signing this contract was this explained to me.In addition, I was told when I originally called to cancel that it would most likely be waived. ""They do it all the time"". When I turned in the equipment I was told the same thing. I was highly disappointing in this response considering I was a customer that ALWAYS paid on time and had their service for over 5 years. This was even through times where there was slow internet that would often disconnect. I will actively ensure that I do not utilize Comcast services in the future and will urge friends and family to do the same."
"Maggie of Coral Springs, FL",42516,1,"I requested my service to be transfer from my old address to the new one. I thought everything was fine until I called to confirm three days before my moving and found out that they do not service my new address. A week later, I received a $816.41 bill for early termination fees. What??? Yes, they basically cancelled my service, did not let me know and charged me for it. I called the 1800 number on the bill but the number apparently is private, then I email them but no one answer and during that process, I received a letter from a collection agency. I called them and they said that I have to disputed directly with them. So since I was not able to reach a human soul, I tried chatting in the site.I was helped by Emmanuel, which stated that I was right, however he said that I needed to call another number because they are the ones that handled that. I called and a service rep told me that he needed to escalate the matter to the escalation team (???) which said that they were not able to remove the early termination fees because somewhere in the contract states that I was responsible even If they do not service an area. (Whattt). What is more interesting is that I have a friend that just went through the same thing but in her case they were able to remove the fees. So bottom line, it seems that Comcast is choosing and picking who they would like to help!!! Do that sounds discriminatory to anyone???"
"Carl of Upper Marlboro, MD",42514,1,"I recently received my Comcast bill and my normal $150 bill (for past 4 years) was nearly $600. I figured must be a billing mistake and called Comcast to resolve. The customer service rep informed me that my phone bill had racked up international charges (to Africa) of nearly $400. I informed the rep I've never used the phone service, never activated the number, and don't even have a handset. Rep informed me they would open a dispute case, have a supervisor call me within 48 hrs, and remove the charges. Additionally, I cancelled that number and received a new phone number and figured, done deal. Ten days later, no call from supervisor, no info on case and charges not removed. The same thing happened 2 more times even though I was assured each time the matter would be resolved. On the fourth call I find out the original case had been closed (without my notification or concurrence) and my charges were now $1000+ because calls continued to Africa from that original number that although cancelled still linked to my account. Even after Comcast phone technicians/ department informed me I could not have made the calls because the number was never activated, nor did I receive a handset, Comcast still has not removed the charges or rectified the situation, not sure why they don't listen to their own people. It's been over a month now and the charges still continue to mount ($1000+ now). I've since cancelled both numbers associated with my account, but don't have any confidence or faith this will resolve the issue and feel the phone charges will continue to add up. Now I'm worried because the bill is overdue, Comcast might send out to collections and possibly ruin my credit score.How someone was able to hack my number/account and how Comcast was unable to stop them from continuing to rack up charges even after I notified them blows my mind. Completely unacceptable and once this is finally resolved, I will definitely discontinue my service with Comcast. Just don't feel safe. They can stop it from happening again or resolve in a timely manner if it were to happen again. Complete loss of confidence!"
"Francis of Decatur, GA",42513,1,"Comcast has repeatedly ""slammed"" me in the past 7 years. My monthly billing is spectacularly unpredictable despite maintaining the same products. I've been sporadically billed for equipment such as a modem which was returned to their technician. I've been billed for sports programming packages I've never ordered. After every such incident I've had to endure 40+ minutes of their 'customer service' banality, as they promise that the issue is resolved. Discounts are applied then disappear a month or two later. I WAS ASSURED MY MONTHLY BILL WOULD REMAIN STATIC FOR 12 MONTHS. Three months later my bill has increased 30%."
"Rachelle of Branford, CT",42513,1,"I called in to downgrade my service to Internet (from triple play) and was informed the monthly fee would still be $80. I ask why it would be so high when new customers could get Internet $45? The customer service rep on the other end of the phone told me that they couldn't get the level of Internet that I had for $45 yet there is a very clear ad for the very same Internet for $45 a month. They would not give me a cheaper rate so I canceled the service.Today I went to turn in the TV box and the modem. I was greeted at the door. I was given a ticket and asked to sit and wait. Five minutes later one of the representatives named Courtney called my name. He did not greet me when I got to the counter. He did not say anything. I handed him the ticket I had been given, which he took, processed, did whatever he had to do in the computer, handed me a receipt and I left. He did not say a word. Such good customer service, no wonder their reviews are so low!"
"Kay of Sa, MA",42511,1,After reading a few reviews I had to write my own because I have run into the same problem. I have had Comcast for 7 months now and all I wanted to do was a simple address change and before I began Comcast put a random number on my account without asking me for one and they said they tried to contact me multiple times. So after I put the request to change to address I received a call from a lady named Andrea from the activation team stating I have a past due account from 2012 where I had cable for barely 2 months and before I switch my account I have to pay for it. 2012 I have no recollection of this and let me remind you I had service for 7 months. Paid on time and everything and paid off a previously owed bill. Long story short this Andrea lady put a block on my apartment so my roommate cannot get cable either and Comcast is the only cable service that is available in my area. SMH. My thing is I didn't receive one letter nor is it on my credit report that I owe anything from 2012 to Comcast so I'll continue to use their internet and on demand service free of charge since they won't let me pay for service that I already had.
"Robert of Washington, DC",42510,1,"Just another way how companies here try to invade your privacy. I am sending payment from external sources now. And I am getting rid of Comcast, it is only getting worse."
"Kathleen of Arlington, VA",42509,1,"I previously had the very basic Comcast service with very few channels but faster internet. I moved and upgraded my service to a bundle including fast internet, more channel and phone. I did not need or want the home phone service but could not get the bundle without taking it. I told the Comcast rep that I did not intend to use the home phone (I do not even have a physical phone) as I only use my cell. I was told ""no problem"" that it will just be there when I want to use it. I have been trying to pay my bill for my new account online. Only my old account is showing up and I cannot open a new account or link to my new account from my old account. I have made 4 calls to Comcast, spent time with their rude online chat, talked to 2 supervisors to try to get this resolved - over 3 hours to try to pay them money!!! They will not change over or help me set up my new online account until after they call me at home on their Comcast number. I keep telling them that I am calling from work, and do not have a physical phone for them to call me on. Still not resolved. I was never told that I would have to have a phone to do any ""security verification"" and I feel like I was lied to by Comcast. Again, I am trying to pay my bill online - something that saves them money. Rude and unhelpful customer service. If I had another choice, I would switch but Comcast is the only service in my area. I can hardly wait until some real competition comes so I can leave Comcast."
"Kevin of Minneapolis, MN",42509,1,"I recently check my credit report and found that Comcast did a hard credit check back in Oct. 2015. So I called to get this resolved and they issued a ER1 Ticket to dispute this issue. At first I felt I was getting the runaround on why it happened. So for two weeks I called and I even went to a local office to get answers, but no one could provide me that information. So I took matters into my own hands and filed a complaint with the FCC and my Attorney General. Just days after my FCC complaint, I received a call from Comcast Public Relations that said they have issued a letter to Equifax and I will soon get an update from the FCC that this matter was resolved. Now I just have to wait out the 30+ for a credit score update to see on Credit Karma if they did the right thing this time. They mention that a billing error caused the hard credit check, because I had just returned the equipment and closed my acct. with them back in Oct. 2015."
"Bruce of Swissvale, PA",42508,1,"I had called Comcast to have my service moved from one address to another. Everything was set, at least I thought it was. On the next day, I received a call from a Comcast rep. stating that there was a past due account bill that needs to be settled before they can transfer my service. That's when everything started. Comes to find out that a fraud had happened sometime ago and that's what they were referring to. Keep in mind that I presently have service with them. As I write this, call after call after call, tried my best to get to the bottom of this long story. Person after person, promise after promise that this problem is solved. Finally got answer that payment must be made before they can transfer service. Bad, bad service from reps. One says one thing, someone else says another. I am sure that Comcast as big as they won't close over $653.00. If so, then everyone involved should look for a better company to work for."
"Dore of Broomfield, CO",42507,1,"Comcast blocked my business number by adding their own phone number to my account. I received new service today that did not include a phone number. They added one with no paperwork and no authorization. I have now been on the phone 5 hours and it is still not resolved. I have been hung up on, transferred, switched to departments, and had the line just go dead. No one has ever called me back. I still have no access to my business line and my clients cannot reach me. I also cannot access my voicemails. Comcast personnel have lied to me all day."
"Theresa of Portland, OR",42506,2,"In early April, we decided to try Xfinity to speed up our internet service and get cable for the first time. The company was timely with installation, and everything worked. However, we found ourselves uninterested in most of the cable channels. There was a good movie channel, but with commercials -- why have commercials when we are going to pay for the content? We decided we were fine without cable, just using Netflix.So we called them to cancel after 3 weeks, disconnected the box and returned it to a store. The next day we got a bill for $200 -- installation charges plus month one. We called about that, and the customer service rep said it was all good; we just needed to return the box. We said we already had, and he checked and saw that was the case. Now, three weeks later, we got another bill in which the original charges are there, as well as an early cancellation fee and a charge for not returning the box. In all, Comcast says we owe $500 for trying out their service for about three weeks, which was supposed to be free. Now we will have to hassle about straightening that out. It's too bad, because we liked the faster internet and were thinking about signing up just for that. But now I don't trust the company to be honest about their deals nor to bill accurately."
"Billy of Union, MI",42504,1,"We all know what the issue is. They are terrible with customer service. It is not the employees on the phone with you for hours. It is the overall business model. I spend several HOURS per year on the phone trying to keep my Phone, Internet and Cable TV functioning, and have for years. It's a joke and should be illegal. My bill is $250 - $300 per month and a bigger rip off than today's health care insurance. Comcast has no respect for my time. I hate to think of the hours of my life that I will never get back, I've spent frustrated and upset with Comcast. They are basically the only real choice I have in my area because of Internet needs. Comcast should not have the only control over the Coax cables. They need serious competition! I really dislike Comcast and its business model, however they are so huge, they know they can do what they want. Congratulations Comcast! I hate doing business with you and yet I still keep paying because I have no other logical choice! I can only hope that someday a competitor is able to snuff them out! I feel a little better, but not great. Lol."
"Avtar of Hayward, CA",42503,1,"Comcast screwed up my entire order. I asked for my service to be disconnected at my old address 05/04 and activated at my new address on 05/05. They disconnected the service on 05/03 and no connection was done at the new address even though they said it was already done. They stated that the transfer order was not put thru and did that on 05/06 and then they assigned me a new phone number giving my phone number of 19 years away.I have spent over 15 hours trying to get service restored and transferred with each agent giving me a new number to call with the same call prompts and reaching a new guy who couldn't help with a new 800 number to call (800-266-2278, 888 739 1379, 888 565 4329) and then disconnecting the call. I decided to transfer my old number to Vonage but Comcast decided not to release it due to them disconnecting it. Now I'm spending another 3 hours having them re-activate it so that it can be ported and my call has been disconnected twice now."
"Shawna of West Springfield, MA",42503,1,"It doesn't matter how much we, the customer/consumer (this is the Consumer Affairs website) complains about the extremely bad and very expensive service that Comcast does not provide because Comcast and the government are in bed together. Therefore, nothing will happen because Comcast does not have to answer to anyone. I have, as many others so many problems with Comcast only to have them unresolved. The new Xfinity 1 is probably the worst experience with TV watching I have ever had. When I switched, I was forced to have their modem and router together and the damn thing keeps disconnecting my wireless printer. I'm thinking it is when they do their updates in the wee hours in the morning. That is a treat to have to reset the printer & the tv after a reset.The phone service is one step below two soup cans and a string. Voice mail that dumps week old messages, even deleted messages into your mailbox 7 days later. Supervisors give you their phone numbers so you can call them directly, what a joke. They don't answer and they definitely don't return the phone call. DVR doesn't record scheduled recording, either series or just one show but it records other shows. It's selective recording or the NSA getting into our DVR boxes and deciding what we can record and watch."
"Kevin of Miami, FL",42502,1,"Had a $300 charge on my account from Comcast when my bill was $0. That bounced 11 little payments, now with charges it's $775.00 plus that money was for daughter's prom. What a problem. Been to BBB, FCC."
"Meshia of Atlanta, GA",42502,1,"I'm an ex Comcast customer in Georgia. I received a flyer in my mailbox that read 250 channels and 75mbps internet for 69.99. I jumped on the phone and spoke to a representative and order the service. I had one concern. I wasn't going to be in town so I wanted the box mailed to me on a later date, so I will not get charged for Comcast usage. She assured me that will not happen and she will note my account. A few days later my neighbor informed me I had a package at my door. I asked her to please put it in her home and I will achieve once I arrive back to Atlanta, GA.A week later I did retrieve the package from her and stored the Comcast box in my coat closet, due to not having the time to call Comcast to activate the service, and to call AT&T to terminate the service. Once again I rushed out of town for business. I came back to Atlanta, and called Comcast Customer Service. A male was my representative, and I provided him my address name and telephone number. I then said I was out of town and I want to make sure I will not be charge for services before I actually hook up the Comcast box. The male representative says ""sure ma'am I can help you"" and he then recite my services ""250+ Latino channels 75mbps internet"".I told him ""NO NO NO. I order that but English speaking"". He said ""no ma'am. What I have is 250+ Latino channels. 75mbps internet"". I told him ""I cannot do anything with that. I do not speak Spanish nor can I read it so what will be the purpose. I do not want that."" He apologized (I think), and we disconnected the call. I called back again to speak to a representative and I was very upset. I wanted that service for that price in English ONLY. I was told I could not. It's not offered. I then said ""well take me back to my internet 10, 14 or 15 mpbs."" I was told that that offer that I originally had is no longer offered.I was furious at this point because I did not get what I wanted, and I cannot even go back to what I had and what was offered was $5 more. I did not want to give Comcast a penny more, rather I had it or not. I assure the representative that my other home address is ** and I will cancel that service too. I informed him I cannot look at On Demand in my living room and I sick of COMCAST.I later spoke to my husband whose name is on the account I'm an authorize decision maker (myself) of what happened and he said ""give Comcast a chance to make it correct, if not then yes we can cancel here also."" Now, at this point I call and cancel my service with Comcast internet for $19.99 a month, (I do believe) a week later. I go to comcast.com to pay the remaining balance, and I see I owe $300+. I call to resolve the issue and I was told, I still had the boxes. I went to the store to return the boxes April 15, 2016 at 5:48 pm est. I ask the representative to note that the boxes were not open and all items were in the box. The gentleman at the door told the customer agent that the box was unopened, and smiled. I then asked her to ""add the notes in the system for me please.""I spoke to a lady customer service representative who assured me a manager will call me back. She promised and she will follow up with me. She promised me because I had already called 2xs and have yet to get a return call, nor was my account noted from the March call that I said I did not want the Latino Channels nor Comcast. I finally received a callback from the customer service representative, saying she has not forgot about me and she will have the manager call me back. He's on lunch currently. I told her I returned the boxes. She said okay. The manager called me back and I explained everything above to him. He said he will call me back. Give him a moment (I guess to look over my account).I received a call back from another male whom claimed he was a manager (very unprofessional). I asked him where is the other manager I spoke to. He said ""it doesn't matter who you talk to. Me or him. He's going to tell you the same thing!"" I said it does matter. Everyone is so unprofessional there. No callback, promises not kept, everyone is telling me something different. ""Listen I can't do nothing right now. We have a process we must go through."" (HE WAS OVERTALKING ME.) I stopped him RIGHT in tracks!I told him ""does Comcast not follow first call resolution? Who are you to act as if I'm bothering you at work? This is your job. You chose customer service and I will appreciate it you let me vent, and get whatever else I have off my shoulders."" ""WELL, to be honest this wouldn't be an issue if you would have returned the box!"" This is what your representative said to me. And as I told him ""yes it's my fault for the box. I should have returned it but your representative should have noted my account also."" There's so many other stories to tell, but at this point I'm done. What do I want? I want my balance to be zero out, train your people, pull those calls, listen to my calls, and train the customer services rep from those calls. FIRST CALL RESOLUTION."
"duane of Woodstock, GA",42501,1,"Do Not trust these people. Lie cheat and steal. Cannot be trusted and no customer service. Your bill will be a lot higher than what is negotiated.

"Aaron of Springfield, OR",42501,1,"The tech was friendly but that is where the fun stopped and you got on this rickety train of bs and poor policies that are designed to affect those with poor credit. They feel it is okay to ask someone struggling for $100 to put an existing service in their name. The way they go about it is funny to say the least, they shut off the ""existing"" service and put in the ""new"" service that is no different from the former. That is seriously the basis in which they justify this nonsense. Not to mention that large sum is ""refundable after one year."" Let me ask you this... if I move to another location or decide after 6 months I no longer want you guys, you have $100 that I bust my butt for when you are a telecommunications giant. Go rot down near the earth's core you scum! Almost everything dealing with Comcast is a waste of time itself."
"Thanh of Fremont, CA",42501,1,"I have an issue with my Comcast online account that no one at Comcast can help me get resolved. I have shown this problem to many different people in many different Comcast departments many different times over a period of many, many wasted hours. I even showed it to the Comcast reps, live at my local Comcast store. They said they couldn't help me. No one at Comcast knows who I need to talk to to get this problem resolved. The problem is that my online account doesn't show me any of my past bills. My company reimburses me for my internet usage, but they require that I show them the bill. Since I can't see or access **any** of my past bills, this is a problem for me when I forget to submit a bill before the billing cycle rolls over to the next period. Now on top of that, my online account is showing me a very wrong billing amount that's due. So, basically, my online account is utterly useless to me. If Comcast didn't have the monopoly on internet service in my area, I would've left them long, long ago."
"conda of Richmond, VA",42500,1,"I called Xfinity on 04/23/16 to transfer my service to my new home.

"nadine of Alexandria, VA",42500,1,"My rental apartment has a contract with Comcast therefore I have no option to select another company. I am contracted for 2 years; not optional. For the past 5 months I have had repairman after repairman come to my home. I don't know these men and have stated to Comcast enough is enough with the guys coming to my home; I'm a single female. These men get comfortable, text, tell you their divorce woes and so on. How long before I run into the one who's decided to check out and me with him (have you read the papers lately?). The odds keep growing. I have had 5 repairmen and 1 repeat to so call fix my service. My service is out yet again and they want me to take more work leave atop of my $208.00 bill every month. Leave is not an option. I must wait 7 complete days to have yet another repairman fix my problem. So this is what America has become; big business can screw up my credit if I don't pay yet the little guy must pay for that which she does not get. I work hard for my $ yet my sweat benefits corporate America. They get 100% of their $ and a % of mine for no service rendered."
"keith of Milwaukie, OR",42500,1,"Every service that I have with Comcast: tv, Internet etc. is borderline fraud. There is no customer service, Internet streaming is iffy at best. I could write a Dostoyevsky length novel of my complaints and utter disrespect that Comcast treats its customers. Why bother making a litany of numerical complaints that will be ignored. Comcast's business model is focused on shareholders and the quarterly report. This short term business model is ignorant, childish, and utterly incompetent. I will continue to use your ""services"" just to keep an eye on you. Malfeasance is a prosecutorial crime."
"Latasha of Hartford, CT",42500,1,My mom has Comcast Cable. I help my mother pay the bill. We never missed a monthly payment. Bill was paid on time every month but for some reason bill never got lower only high... I moved to a new location in February. I had to wait for them to get a date to transfer my services here where it get interesting. They wanted like 4 month to transfer a balance from my old address to my bill and because they wanted so long to do this my bill is skyŠ—Ès the limit. I feel it should be a law against company prorating people bill because they don't how much cable someone going to watch for the month. Something need to be done about how much they charge people to watch cable. Company need to realize not everyone work and some people are on a fix income so to charge all the money for cable make no sense. I feel like they should be put on some time of investigation because when you pay a bill it suppose to go down not get higher when you put money on it.
"Ivy of Murfresboro, TN",42499,1,"I called because my internet was running slow. They said I could take it to the store and swap it out. I don't really have time to do that but they insisted they would be charging me if they had to send one out. It got a little better for a while and started acting up again. When I called the first time they advised me there was a known issue in my neighborhood, but there was only two customers and that wasn't enough for them so send someone out. So I call back 6 months later. Same issue and my bill almost doubled after the first year - $55.00 to $95.00. I understand an annual increase but 5-10 dollars should be enough. They told me if I didn't agree to free phone or TV I would have to stay at $95.00 a month. I do not want the free services. I want what I have for a fair charge. That guy was terrible.I was then sent to a woman who said she was going to charge me to send out a box. I finally got her to agree to do it for no charge since there is a known issue. 2 weeks later all that has showed up is new cables. I called to ask when the box would show up and was advised the request was never put in. ""Ok, so put it in please."" ""Sure but that is going to cost you."" ""No, no it's not."" She sent me to someone else who was magical. She APOLOGIZED. She put in for someone to come out next day and put a small credit on the account for maybe $20.00. She even let me choose my service window for Saturday, 08:00-10:00. 10:01 rolls around and I am on the phone with Comcast. ""Is he still coming?"" ""Yeah he was running a little late and changed it to 10:00-12:00."" Thanks for the call and the heads up geez.He gets out there which wasn't too much later, I understand but you could call. He tells me there is nothing wrong with my box, I just have really slow internet. So I call and say, ""I need to upgrade my internet."" He says, ""Why? You are already getting 75 down..."" ""No, your tech just said I have 35 down..."" So we are back to the area issue. I am paying for 75 down but getting 35 down, sweet. They said you pay for up to 75 down but since I don't ever get that, why aren't I charged for up to 40? This has been a nightmare. I called in when I got my invoice because I had requested to speak to a supervisor 3 times with a promise of a callback within 24-48 hours. It has been weeks.I got this invoice and due to the problem still not being fixed and not having a supervisor call me back I asked for the bill to be credited as a 1x we are sorry and want to keep your business peace offering. They advised me unless I turn in the box or pay for another tech to come out they can not and will not. It has to be fixed before they will credit a future invoice. It is a never ending circle. I get it you bill in advance, but what about all the past issues. It has been a stage 5 event and I hate Comcast. 2 out of the 10 people act like they have a soul and it is a shame. Jesus take the wheel when it comes to this company. They are terrible and have very minimal customer service. I never thought I would say this but, you get nicer people and better people at Verizon... And they are the devil. Worst company out there."

Shall I go on.One customers story. I have been with Comcast for over 18 years. The past several years it is rare that I don't spend hours on the phone on a monthly basis attempting to correct problems with the service or the bill. My internet and phone service has been down for several days at a time - more than a few times in the past 2 years. I have had the cable modem changed out 3 times in as many weeks. Each time I was told the modem did not work or was not the modem. Regarding my bill that was supposed to be consistent if I agreed to a 2 year contract I have called almost on a monthly basis in an attempt to correct. Every month I am told one or a combination of these excuses: 1 - The previous agent did not code it correctly. 2 - The previous agent was incorrect. 3 - The previous agent made notes but did not complete the changes/corrections.Each month I am promised that they would make the proper corrections. The future bills would be correct. I am given exact dates when it will change. Some have even given me their direct phone #. Last month my calls were never returned from this direct #. And yet this months bill was almost double the amount. I have spent dozens and dozens of hours on the phone. Not counting service calls. Even calling Comcast Corporate (BTW the last person not to return a call was the agent assigned to my previous complaint by Comcast Corporate). I have thought about switching to Dish or DirecTV. But they are rated #4 and #2 WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE respectively. I really enjoy the products. However, the time and extreme aggravation caused by the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE leaves me looking and wishing for an alternative."
"Kimberly of Hazlet, NJ",42498,1,"I have been a Comcast xFinity customer for 3 years, But I have finally had enough and am switching. Before moving I had been a Optimum customer for years with very few issues and expected similar service from Comcast. Unfortunately this has not been the case. Consistently since we moved in we have problems with all 3 services. About every 6 mos they have sent someone out to ""fix"" the problem. They check all the connections, replace our equipment and it gets no better. Things have gotten so bad that multiple times a day we have no phone or internet for varying lengths of time sometimes a couple minutes, usually longer up to 3 or 4 hours.With the TV at least once a day try to change the channel and all you get is an error message telling you to try again later. Forget trying to watch something on demand there is a connection problem error message more often than not; and when you actually get to watch something don't be surprised if it starts over in the middle and you can't fast forward to get back to where you were. Customer service will promise you anything to get you off the phone, but they don't follow through with promised credits or adjustments. Oh and if your bill says you ordered an on demand movie when no one was home forget a credit, They would rather claim someone broke in and watched a movie than issue a credit."
"Marjory of Murray, UT",42497,1,"I am writing this review to warn people that Comcast will double your monthly charges and justify it. I decided to cut my cable. I don't watch TV a lot and so I didn't see paying for television. I did, however, want to keep my internet. I use it everyday. I was told that my internet cost would be 89.99 a month even though I do not have TV. I can get internet for cheaper from any other provider. Why would they think I would pay that much for internet. Then I looked at their deals online and for internet only it was 39.99. Needless to say I don't think I will go back. I have resolved all of my issues using my cellphone provided (not Comcast/Xfinity)."
"Heather of Billerica, MA",42496,1,My experience with Comcast has been so stressful that I can hardly sleep. For one my bill is 688 and 80% of that is overcharges! My privacy was violated as they let someone have access to my account with my permission and without my SS number. I have called numerous times to try and get answers to why this happened and spoke to numerous people. One lady laughed at me and was extremely rude. Another man told me the person who tried accessing my account gave them my SS number. Every time I call I get different answers or they have no clue what I'm talking about! This place needs to be shut down or have some sort of investigation. There hidden costs and add on every month. One time they came to my house and took our line off the phone pole to disconnect us for no reason! So we had no service for days and nothing was done about that either! This company makes me sick. There is also more I haven't added but don't have time to write a novel.
"Lisa of Ceresco, MI",42496,1,"Nightmare!!! Everything is automated. Customer service when you call is either a computer or someone out of state or out of country. No follow up or resolution to problems when you call. Have been trying to get have cable/internet installed for two months. No phone calls back when promised. They were trying to bid it out to lay the line from the house to pole across the street. Basically if your house is newly built or not wired to the cable service along the road, plan on never getting it installed because they do NOT want new customers apparently that require more work than just switching out equipment."
"jill of Newark, DE",42496,1,"Comcast is a joke and I WILL NEVER give them my money. They are a very greedy company and they do not care about their customers or employees. I won't say too much but I will say this: LIES. They are liars. Price will go up month 12 on a 24 month contract. They have equipment hikes once a year. Their internet sucks. There's never nothing on cable. The home security is a joke. If you change your location and you're at the end of your agreement you are automatically place in a new contract. They do not care about life events. They want the early termination fee, no question asked. DO NOT DO IT. Not having is better than the stress."
"Carl of Concord, CA",42496,1,Comcast cable will pixelate and the sound cuts in and out throughout every show or movie. The customer service knows this is a problem but they just run you in circles and leave you stranded. They also block access to their programming via the internet even though you are a paid subscriber. An example is the Starz channel app is available to stream directly via the internet connection but Comcast blocks access to it. You will see a long list of all the cable providers that allow you to authenticate but you will NOT find Comcast. My only hope is they will be put out of business by the streaming services. It's lower cost to pay for them directly and you don't have to pay for all the crap channels Comcast forces you to pay for just to get the few that you would like to have.
"Stephanie of Sacramento, CA",42495,1,"I've been a loyal Comcast customer for years. Today, I tried to get an extension for a couple of days, because I had just lost my job and wanted to wait a little while longer to pay it off. Not only did they refuse to give it to me (even if we just owe $80, and I was just asking for five days), they also took the time to tack on extra fees in addition to our monthly bill, and they tripled the amount we owe to $292. I am broke and in-between jobs, and I rely on the internet in order to find work. How am I supposed to pay that off? I am very angry with them and I hope they rot in Hades."
"Melissa of Champaign, IL",42494,1,"We requested a change of address due a move. They made such a mess that our service was interrupted the day after we called, instead of the moving date we provided. We had to call several times to try and resolve the issue. This was 3 months ago. Now, our service was turned off because of lack of payment. We were not told that once you move, they give you another account number; mind you we never even received a bill in the mail and our account online said we did not owe anything. They told us we had to pay an exorbitant amount of money that does not make sense since our plan is quite cheap. They verified and said that we changed the plan!!! All we wanted was an offing change of address and they are so inept that they ** up something that is so freaking simple. At the moment, we are still on the phone (3 months after the move, and after numerous calls) and they have the audacity of keeping us on the plan they changed, which is more expensive. They are stating that that plan has a discount... After almost an hour on the phone, now they tell us that our previous plan does not apply in our new address. Apparently, low IQ is a requirement in this company."
"Autry of Huntsville, AL",42494,1,"I call the Comcast customer service officials to speak with a representative. When she answered the phone she was very rude. The first thing she asked was, ""would you like to upgrade your service,"" and I replied. ""No I do not. I call to see if I could get a lower rate with another plan."" She hung the phone up on me. So I called DIRECTV and ordered their service, which was $150.00 cheaper. Comcast xfinity has very rude representatives and very bad customer service. I will never order services with Comcast xfinity again and I will not recommend their services to anyone."
"Dale of Augusta, GA",42492,1,"First they blocked access to my property due to their problem with another customer that is not associated with my address in any way. Second they made me bring proof of ownership to store to correct their error. Third, in store has no place to be served unless you stand, elderly and infirm alike. There was no one paying attention to anyone in lobby. One older man had to leave because he could not stand as long as they made us wait. It was difficult for me due to physical condition as well. Then the attendant was abrupt and totally lacking kindness. Fourth, they are making me wait until they decide to unblock my property due to their error even after I gave them proof of ownership. It has been 5 days now that I am waiting. If I could use another company for cable I would never use Comcast."
"Wayne of Las Vegas, NV",42491,1,"Terrible bait and switch advertising. They advertise $129 a month quad play and bill you $300 a month. Customer service is awful, you spend one hour on phone with them and accomplish nothing!"
"Com of Steamboat Springs, CO",42491,1,"Every time I try to watch a show online, it will skip backwards during a commercial. This forces me to watch the commercials over and over and over as I wait for the show to return. Then the show comes back on. It has been reset to the beginning. When I try to get back to the show where it skipped away, I am forced to watch another round of commercials. This is an endless battle."
"John of Minneapolis, MN",42489,1,"I was going to describe my horrible customer service experience with Comcast, but it would be a repeat of the thousands of complaints about their customer service or lack thereof. They don't have customer service or any that is of any use and it is pretty apparent that they DO NOT CARE! I wish so much there was some real competition because they would be run right out of business."
"john of Naperville, IL",42488,1,"If you are receiving terrible service from Comcast, and Internet connection that's absolutely miserable please email me at **."
"Martin of Flemington, NJ",42487,1,A Comcast technician came out to my house and cut my copper wires coming to my house. I've been trying for over a month to get Comcast to fix the wires and they just put me on hold all the time. They are refusing to do anything about it.
"bill of Gatlinburg, TN",42487,1,"What Refund???!!! Jan 2016 decided we had enough with Comcast and switched to AT&T/DirecTV. 1-25-16: Sent all hardware by UPS back to Com - 5 pieces. 2-5 received statement saying I have a 61.58 refund. 2-9-16: Called in about refund. CSR Fatimah of Fla says they DID receive ALL 5 parts, AND that I have a refund of 181.58, which will be SENT OUT in 2 wks. 3-17-16: I called and Gabriel/Billing ID ** says refund WAS NOT PROCESSED, that she will submit today, take 6 wks. 4-6-16: I called 'to check' on status. Mike ID ** says he can't find ticket of 3-17 or 1-25. Finally after 15 min, finds Gabriel ** notes of 3-17. Creates ticket #** to confirm that after talking to Super, that ck for 181.58 would be sent out in 3-5 DAYS, NOT WEEKS. 4-26-16 at Noon: Asked for super in US, got Esperinza ID #** in Philippines! She checked notes and finds my calls of Feb, March, April 6th. HOWEVER, now she says that they didn't receive all the equip and were holding up my ck. She couldn't give me answer as to why I wasn't made that know on 4-6 call. However, when I quoted her the serial numbers of equipment, UPS tracking Number, and UPS receipt # (that fortunately I had kept) - she quickly created a new ticket #**, of which we did receive an email stating it had been created which we had not gotten in previous calls. However, now she says that it will take another 7 days for review of matching the UPS receipt with what equipment they received. (She and I had matched up all serials numbers on the equip, with UPS receipt.) THEN it will take another 7-14 days after that to 'cut the check'. (Now on the phone for 1 hr 7 min at this point.) Asked her how often do they train them on how to lie to a customer... I then asked her again for 3rd time for a Supervisor, the one who would approve a pay raise for her... on hold for 20 min... 'all the Superv are on a conference call right now'. I reminded her that's what I heard 1hr 22 min ago. She 'set me up' to have a real Superv call me back in 90 min. Stay tuned."
"Patricia of San Jose, CA",42487,1,"My mother has been paying for Comcast cable services since January 3, 2011 but she did not receive her cable boxes until yesterday, April 25, 2016. A Comcast representative confirmed that this is true and promised that I will receive a refund for the payments made during the entire time that my mother did not receive the cable boxes. Please refer to ticket # **. I have tried to called multiple times but I keep getting transferred to multiple departments without resolution to this matter. My mother is entitled to a refund of the payments that she had made for cable services that she did not receive between January 3, 2011 to April 25, 2016. I would appreciate it if someone would help me resolve this issue, promptly."
"Maggie of Wheaton, Other",42485,1,"Unfortunately, my landscaper cut my cable when planting in the backyard. I called Comcast to schedule repairs and was told that it would be addressed the following day. I took off work to be present, and waited all day - no one showed up. When I called Comcast to check on the appointment, I was told I was the last call of the day. Again, waited, but no one showed up. I called the next day to ask what happened, and was told I was on the schedule for that day. I waited and guess what - no one showed up. I made multiple calls throughout that day to check on the schedule, and got the same lines and routine by each representative. They have a script, and they read the script. They tell you what you want to hear, even though it is a blatant lie.I finally spoke to a supervisor, and he was worse that all of the agents. He had no better process or solution to the problem - very sad, sad customer service. They have no idea how to solve a problem. They have broken processes which are meaningless and worse yet, I don't think they care!! In the meantime, I'm still without service and wondering if I should just switch to AT&T. If I could rate them ""zero"" stars, I would."
"Gloria of Schaumburg, IL",42485,1,"The Situation: Recently, my cable/internet bill went up almost $20/month. $10 was for a credit that had dropped off and the rest was related to an increase in various subscriber fees. Called Comcast billing dept. Called twice. The first time, I was given the run-around then hung up on. The second time, after questioning the increases, I was told by the rep that the credit was only good for 12 months (which was now up) and that the fees were standard to all subscribers. Ok, the fees I understand and accept. I then pulled the original carbon copy of the contract from my files and explained that it is written that the credit applied to the length of the contract (24 months). The rep claimed their computer system states it is only for 12 months and that they cannot pull the original paperwork because it is company policy to destroy old records after 12 months. They refused to give an email address for me to send a copy of the contract to for verification, again citing company policy. Instead, I'm told to ""walk the paperwork into one of their service locations"". Called Comcast cancellation department. On this call I explained the situation, my interaction with the billing department, and citing the 2nd paragraph of the Comcast Agreement for Residential Services that I wished to cancel service. The rep claimed to have no knowledge of this policy and was not willing to go to their corporate site to look at and discuss the Subscriber Agreement together. The rep's only response to anything I said was that I would have to pay the early termination fee if I were to cancel service.I first tried Comcast 3.5 years ago. When what the salesman had promised was not reflected in the first, second, or third month's bill, I canceled. A little over 2 years later, I was approached by Comcast again and decided to give them a second chance. The deal was good, but learning from past mistakes, I was careful to have every price, surcharge and credit written down and verified. The first bill came correctly, and I'd been fairly happy so far. After this ordeal, I will never do business with Comcast again. It's not just that their customer service is terrible. Their dealings are sketchy if not borderline fraudulent. I'm switching to another provider; one that can not only match what I had with Comcast but is willing to reimburse the Comcast early termination fee."
"George of Emerson, GA",42484,1,"One word says it all... overseas call center. I was overcharged on my second bill and I call to discuss. First of all, when you call customer service you should not hear people clapping and counting down numbers in the background. You could tell they were trying to meet a quota or some other goal that was not customer service related. Sounded like an unprofessional sales center to me (definitely not customer service center). I got put on hold numerous times for unusually long periods of time compared to the short answers I received. When I complained about the background cheering, I got put on hold for a longer period of time. I was likely transferred out of their party and into a private room. Well, 15 to 20 minutes into the call, I realized they were not going to help me with my bill. After the call was ended, I received 5 calls from the same number and they hung up on me each time.When is Comcast (Xfinity) going to learn that overseas call centers hurts their business. The few times I have talked to a state side representative, I felt like I was talking to a pro. If you call and get an overseas call center, just hang up and save yourself a lot of frustration. As soon as Google Fiber gets up and running, Comcast will go the way of Ma Bell (old telephone company that is no longer in business). For now, I will try AT&T or DirecTV. Comcast overseas call center has cost them another customer."
"J. N. of Lake Forest Park, WA",42484,1,"In the process of switching from CenturyLink to Comcast. After reading several other reviewers' statements it is clear Comcast practices unethical business standards and something needs to happen. We too, like many others, are signing up to add internet (first phone call was April 20th, 2016), basic home phone, and upgraded services (to our already basic cable package -- we have Comcast basic cable -- but CenturyLink phone and internet). Without going into all the lengthy details, I will tell you we were quoted prices on the phone by the first tech that seemed reasonable. I verified and reverified these prices with her, and all the details of the packages. Needless to say, the package they want to set us up with now, is not the one detailed in our phone conversation, does not include the specific channels we discussed, and is not the specific prices we were told we would pay. I document my phone calls, but have now started to ask the techs for permission to ""voice record"" our calls. We currently have a ""supervisor"" who is supposedly reviewing our calls (the ones Comcast recorded on their end) and is supposed to get back to us. I am hoping we will get ""real"" action because I had one of their ""loyalty"" supervisors listen to my last phone call I self-recorded (with the tech's permission). It is clear in the phone call that they have majorly screwed up. It seems to me, there should be a Federal law that requires cable companies to send out emails or letters that fully cover the terms of the contract, the fees, and anticipated state/local taxes. This would keep Comcast and other companies accountable for their business practices. What other service companies does one enter into a contract with that doesn't let you read the terms of the contract first? Who is a lawyer out there that knows how to get the ""ball rolling"" on trying to get a law like this passed? There is absolutely no reason why cable companies cannot send summarizing email contracts to their potential subscribers that recount the specific terms of the agreement, the fees, etc. Help please!"
"Kenneth of North Barrington, IL",42484,1,"For over 20 years, I diligently paid Comcast's statements each month - if I had not, I would have had to pay interest plus a penalty. On 12/18/15, I returned ALL of the Comcast equipment I had in my possession to a Comcast-approved UPS store. Fortunately, I saved the UPS receipt. Comcast sent me an email on 1/4/16 confirming receipt of the equipment. After not receiving the equipment refund from Comcast plus any remaining charges for unused services, I called Comcast on 2/9/16 to inquire about its status. I was informed by the person I spoke to that my refund would require 4-6 weeks for Comcast to process. On 4/12/16, I filed a pre-complaint with the FCC and received a telephone call from Comcast on 4/13/16, after which I sent four emails to the person I spoke to which included my UPS receipt, the confirmation of receipt sent to me by Comcast, a previous email communication with Comcast, and an email requesting receipt of the information I sent to the person I spoke to. It is now 4/24/16 and I still have not received my refund nor the requested confirmation that my emailed information.Updated on 5/01/16: Finally, on April 29 I received the Comcast refund check which was precisely 4 months after I returned their equipment. I did not received a late charge or interest that Comcast would have demanded from me had the roles been reversed. With Comcast, it's a one-way street where the customer's opinion means diddly squat."
"Brenda of Lebanon, OR",42483,1,"I have been with Comcast 3 years. Am leaving them and going with DirecTV. I have phone, cable, internet and a alarm system through them. I got my alarm system hooked up last year. Mind you it has not worked right since. In the beginning when I had my service hooked up I got the protection plan added. Two weeks ago I have to have someone come out because my alarm system was down and I could not get my video cameras to come up. I got my bill and I was CHARGED for them coming out. I called them today and they told me that I had to pay for another protection plan for my alarm system. I told them ""I was never told this when you put my system in"". All the lady on the phone said was ""Oh"". I refuse to pay this bill. They can eat it. They have got enough money out of me. I have been paying over 200$ a month and now they want $300 this month. I can not afford that. Am not SSD. There is no way I can afford that. They don't tell you about their hidden fees and the fact that you have to pay for someone to come out and fix their crap. I will never go back there. I will be going through Centurylink for my internet. It might be a little slower but at this point I don't care. As long as am far away from Comcast."
"Annette of Kennesaw, GA",42482,1,"For several days I went online and checked out Comcast and what they offered. I did a live chat session with one of their representatives. During the chat I asked for them to tell me exactly what additional charges and fees would appear on my bill. She told me that there was a $80.00 fee for one-time installation charges -- a $50.00 professional install and a $30.00 install fee for new outlet. At that time I told her I was not interested in switching to Comcast due to the 2 install fees. A day later a representative called my cell phone to discuss why I did not want to continue with Comcast. I explained the fees issue. He told me that the install fees will be waived. I told him I did not trust that they would be waived. He told me that he would send me a email that shows the fees would be waived, which he did. The email shows one-time fees $0.00, along with the breakdown of my bill and my install appointment time.When the tech was done with the installation he asked me to sign the completion order, which was on a iPad. As I scrolled up to see what it said, I saw where all these fees were added. I questioned him about it. He replied that they were standard on all install orders and because I have the email showing the cost is too $0.00 that it is already in the system and I will not see the charges it on my bill. That was a lie. All them charges were on my bill. When I called Comcast they told me they showed no notes saying that I was to receive free install, and that the tech was the one who was supposed to remove them charges. Since when does a technician decided what goes on a customer bill??? As I continued to explain that I have a email form your company that I was not to be charged, she told me, ""Well I don't see a email saying that, therefore I will not remove the charges."" I offered to send her the email from her company saying the fees will be $0.00. She told me to take copies to a XFINITY store and talk to them about it. So even though I have in writing that the install fees would be $0.00 they will not honor their own word!!! Be advised that Comcast will not keep their word, even if you have it in writing from them."
"Linda of Chicago, IL",42481,1,"Received letter from Comcast that due to a recent Audit, it was found that they have not been charging me for a box since the start of this service. If I don't want to be charged this, send them the additional outlet box back. Really, now I gotta not only pay for a box that was part of the original package, I need to take it back to them instead of the sending for it or offering pickup. They should eat this cost. I've had my service for over a year and a half and now you want to tack on more fees. I'm cancelling and switching over to anyone but them. I never saw a need for cable, since I'm out so much, but now it's not worth it. Just think if they sent out this $3.99 charge to a million customers - it's a nice payday for them."
"Jesus of Sebring, FL",42481,1,"On April 8, 2016 at around 5:36 we spoke to a person named Youling (unsure of spelling of names) about the triple play package that we saw is for 129.99 plus tax and we mentioned that it will not be higher than that and she said no. We also let her know that day that we want the same phone number we have with century link transferred over and that we want the channel Baby first tv, and she said no problem and that it will be done. On April 13, 2016 around 9:00 we were supposed to get our installation done and one. They said they came and knocked, did not happen. So we had to call again and we spoke to Lizzy who helped to get a technician over to install. And we spoke with her and verified we were getting our same phone number as well as our channels including what we requested (baby first tv), and she stated Yes we will and that we should not worry and sorry for the inconvenience. April 13, 2016 around 12:00. Now when the technician, David, came and started installing we noticed the house phone number had completely changed to a new one and that we did not have the channel we requested. And we told him to stop the installation and let's get this fixed first before continuing. David calls Comcast regarding the channel baby first tv and he spent quite some time on the phone with them and then said the engineers were working on it. And so then he called them about our home phone number and right then and there we found out that Comcast never did anything about us getting our number transferred over to them.The importance of our home phone number is that All our doctors have that number and already my wife missed an important call about the MRI of her spine. Our family have that home phone number and 2 members of our family (one on each side) have cancer, and friends have that home phone number (which my family did not get to contact my friends for a surprise party they did for my birthday).David said we needed to do a third party verification, which was the first time it was mentioned to us, and we did it with him still here. He told us that it was done and that in three days it should be fixed. Then we went back to the channel and we were told that in 24 hours the problem should be fixed. And so we believed him and he finished and left. Later that day we found out they did not have baby first tv in our area. The technician left the cable on top of the ground in which the cable was cut and we did not have phone, Internet, or cable for a day. And all they did was connect it with a tool and still to this day it is left on top.April 18, 2016 around 8:00 p.m we spoke to a guy named Rolf about our home phone number and why it has not changed to our original and requested number yet. And he said they could not transfer it and that it is century links fault. Notice it has been five days already and they left us without our important calls and never notified us about the issue. Rolf refused to transfer us to his supervisor for a very long time and instead of hanging up and waiting for a call, which most likely would never happen, we stayed on hold until finally we spoke to Terrance (in Michigan) the supervisor. We explained to Terrance our situation about our phone number as well as all the issues we have been having since the 8th and he apologized and was doing his ""best"" to assist us. He said that we should have our number fixed soon, that they already put in the computer to their department that does the transfers and that they will contact us. Even said he would give us a courtesy call the next day to keep us informed of what is going on. Terrance did not call the next day but Rolf did just to say the same thing that it is not fixed. Terrance, going back to the 18th, also tried to help with baby first tv but said it was not in our area and sorry for that, and said if there was a movie channel we want that he would add. But our package was supposed to have all movie channels. He also mentioned that he will not charge us for phone until we finally get our number fixed. On April 19, 2016 we spoke to a lady named Stephanie (in Michigan) about our phone issue and she said we would get it this week. And then she was trying to help us with our package but then we got disconnected. April 21, 2016 we received the bill from Comcast and the bill is way higher than what was advertised and mentioned on the 8th of April. We do not need business with people who take advantage of those who are disabled. We did mention to them that I am a 100% disabled veteran and that my wife is deaf and we have many medical problems and that we needed to be accommodated."
"Polly of Everett, WA",42481,1,"I am renting an apartment and the landlord pays the cable bill and charges us for the service. Basically, in essence, there is no cable when all through the day there are constant interruptions that never stop... If I watch a program and there is an engaging aspect of the show going on, it's always being stopped and missed with all of these constant video signal interruptions, and the digital squares bump up, and then it goes dark, only to momentarily try to show the show again, but then missed what was engaged that brought interest to the show. I hate cable. This goes on for weeks and weeks. I hate the expense for the horrible service that is always constant. Always video signal interruptions with a status code of 225. Nothing is ever fixed. Why do companies get away with charging so much money for that kind of service??? Is this how America is going to turn out to be? To be treated so poorly as a customer and as people? So disappointed... very disappointed. I can do without television."
"Don R  of Tucson, AZ",42480,1,"Comcast is HYPOCRITICAL using credit reporting agencies. While using this practice, Comcast refuses to contribute previous account information on behalf of any customer. Comcast WILL NOT use previous Comcast Customer's Account Information to determine eligibility opening an account. This is REGARDLESS of how good of a customer you were! I had 2 different subscriptions, NEVER missed a payment! Looks like you can miss a payment or more - Comcast doesn't care! Comcast does not use that info anyway!I am demanding, [EVERY COMCAST CUSTOMER SHOULD], Comcast enter previous Comcast Account information in the Credit Reporting Agencies! If Comcast is going to determine a customer's eligibility for an account, using a credit score from one of the three credit reporting agencies! Just tell Comcast if they do not then you will go to another service company. Remember if Comcast will not do as you want - YOU CAN CHANGE! Discrimatory practices for Not Wanting Credit - cash only.

"Bill of Cape Coral, FL",42480,1,I called a few months ago about how HIGH my bill was getting and the agent indicated he could reduce it by enrolling me into this new program. He did and two bills later my charges were almost what I had been paying before. He lied about the final cost of the service. The service charge was lower but now the FEES were higher. Comcast is for the birds and I would never recommend them to anyone. It takes forever to get a REAL person on the line.

They want to reschedule again and I said, ""Hell no. Don't need and want you."" Worse customer service. I don't recommend this company to anyone. CenturyLink much better. Returning everything tomorrow."
"Seun of Lanham, MD",42476,1,"I called Comcast customer service on Monday 4/11/16 to complain that my Internet service is super slow, which Jo, the agent's name, told me that my modem is outdated and I will have to upgrade it by either get their own rented modem at the rate of $10/monthly or buy a modem from Best Buy or any other stores. Which I asked him that ""How long will I have to pay the $10 for?"" So he replied me that as long as I use the modem which doesn't make sense because if I'm to use the modem for 4 years then I have to keep paying it, of which a modem could cost me $200. So I asked ""Can I get mine from Best Buy?"" And he said yes. I got one of the specific modems they listed on their Comcast compatible modems, NETGEAR model C300 modem from Best Buy.And I called them back on Thursday 4/14/16 to activate my devices but to my surprise after 4 hrs of back and forth calls one of their agent told me that the reason why they couldn't activate my TV cable Xfinity Service is because the modem I got is not 2-in-1 (wifi modem router) and he assured me that once I get a modem router that the service will be up and running. So today which is 4/15/16 I went back to Best Buy and exchanged the box with a 2-in-1 modem router and I called Comcast back. But for 5 hours, precisely 1 pm till 6 pm, they completely wasted my time and told me that the new modem does not support voice call, and I was like ""How has TV got to do with a phone service?"" And I requested that what else can we do to make it happen which the guy JEROME told me that I have to get another modem from theirs which means I will have to pay $10 a month and I will also have to pay $59.99 for a technician fee.Now what annoyed me was that they be ripping customers off with some unreasonable charges. If it is that compulsory to have a modem from you guys why not sell it or have the money paid for specific range of time? Why must it be a forever payment thing? That's a ripoff right there. Plus the fact that including their supervisor, and everyone that spoke to me are either bunch of liars or they don't know their JD 'cause they all gave me different information. They all are not in same page. I was like ""Isn't same database y'all pulling those info out?"" I really wanna curse y'all out but I just got to hold my breath, for wasting my time for 2 solid days and yet came up with a trash service option. It's so annoying and unrespectful to customers."
"Angel of Houston, TX",42475,1,"Comcast TOTALLY sucks. They are dishonest. Bad receptions. When you call them to fix receptions issues, it'll take forever. Then there is the phantom charges on top of charges that they tell they won't charge you for. You'll spend countless hours to fix your receptions and billing and still they end up owing you money. Better to go with AT&T."
"Harrison of Avon, IN",42475,1,"I'm not sure where to start, if it was possible to give zero stars I would. My problem started in January, it is now April. I had a good experience setting up my account and it was pretty simple, until problem number one. They forgot to send me my equipment, 3 weeks went by and I decided to call them and that's when I found it was never sent to me. They ended up getting everything to me then come to find out my house was set up for dish and I would need a technician to come out to get this fixed, of course they are so busy and weeks behind no one was available. The first lady I was speaking was pretty rude and I was losing my patience at this point. I then just told her to cancel my service and I'll send everything back.At this point it is now February and I was told my account was cancelled and I'll need to send everything back and my account would be adjusted. I sent everything back and received email confirmation that they had gotten it all back. I thought that was easy and went well, I was wrong. I then kept receiving monthly statements. When I would call, every single time I would have to explain the situation. Every single time I would get the same answer which was that it would be taken care of and it takes a few weeks to go through. Every time I was given a ticket number to give to the next person so I didn't have to go through the same thing over and over, that didn't even make difference I still had to explain everything to everyone.Most of the time I would get transferred from one person to the next. The latest phone call in the beginning of March I was told this was going to go to her supervisor and they would have a hearing and review it and I should hear back in a couple days. I never heard back. At this point I'm having a hard time understanding what is so difficult, I NEVER used the service and they got their equipment back in a few days. Why do I have a bill of 233 dollars??? I finally heard back today, from a collection agency. I have made a couple phone calls every month for the last 4 months to get this straightened out and now it's turned into a collection agency?I called Comcast right after I got this phone call and tried to be as polite as possible, I spoke with a lady named Debbie and she has promised me this would be taken care of and she would be calling back once she finds out more. I asked her what happened the last 6 times I have tried to fix this, her answer was nothing. I was informed that each time I called and was given a ticket number none of the Comcast employees did anything about it. How does this make any sense? It is beyond ridiculous and disappointing companies like this survive."
"Christine of Downers Grove, IL",42475,1,"We just moved into our new house and are trying to get a fence put in but have not been able to do so due to Comcast's cable lines running through our backyard. The wires are all exposed and pose a hazard to my family and pets. There is only one line running to our house. The other 10-15 lines are from other surrounding homes and business lines that are not ours. I have been trying to get in contact with Comcast for over a month now to get what is called a ""down barrier"". I have called over 6 times and put in multiple ""priority tickets"", and even had the Comcast technician who installed our new equipment call. I have been told numerous times that I would receive a callback in 24 hours, 48 hours, that someone would be out in 72 hours and NO ONE has ever called back or showed up.One employee actually forged our signature and signed off and saying that the ticket had been taken care of which is why our first two tickets were honored. I have given them over a month's notice to try to get this fixed. The fence is being put in tomorrow and now that I have finally gotten Comcast's attention (and someone fired in the process) they are saying I will be charged if anything happens to their cable lines and that they cannot be out until April 28th due to all the companies they must contact. As if that is my problem! I cannot even fathom how HORRIBLE Comcast's customer service is. I have been a loyal customer for over 5 years and pay a great deal of money for their service every month. It is absolutely ridiculous that they cannot even get someone you back. How can a company that large have such terrible customer service? They are, by far, the worst company to deal with."
"John of Spokane, WA",42475,1,"We have been fighting with this company's courtesy service department for 2 months now. I am at my wits end. Our voice services keep getting shut off and then back on weeks later, our TV boxes freeze. Kids Zone will not load and the remotes decide to do what they want whenever they want. We have never ever been late on our bills. We always pay early, there is no excuse for this. This company just does not care about their customers or the equipment. They are too concerned with trying to up their ratings with newest and greatest equipment. They did not take time to work out the bugs or their customer service skills. I hate their TV service with every fiber of my being. Internet is fantastic but every other product is shoddy and subpar."
"Debi of Corvallis, OR",42475,1,"Went to create an online log in to manage my account. The online system found my account but wanted to send a verification code to the phone number on file which is an old landline and not text capable. Thought I could find a solution using the chat feature. They were unable to help because, although I can provide all account details, they can't do anything without me verifying the account number or some code on my modem. I don't happen to carry those things around with me. I was also told that the last 4 digits of my ssn number that just worked online, were incorrect. This is internet/tv services, not a high security financial provider. It's on par with the garbage company. They should be able to look a person up and verify billing address etc to assist a person who doesn't happen to carry their bill around with them."
"scott of Branford, CT",42474,1,"As an executive with of a number of technologies companies I'm writing to you because if this happened to one of my customers I'd want to know about it. I'm also hoping this relieves my anger and disappointment with Comcast. On April 4th my wife contacted Comcast to discuss our Xfinity package. It was suggested that our Xfinity TV equipment could be upgraded and a service visit was scheduled. On Tuesday AM, Ryan, a Comcast service tech, came to our house. He replaced the digital TV equipment and departed. I shortly noticed that the phones weren't working. I called Ryan back on the work phone number he provided. He said he had disconnected our phone equipment on the understanding that we didn't have Comcast phone service. He said he would return at 4 pm that day to correct.At 4:00 pm when he returned he said he couldn't recall what cables he had disconnected in the garage. He questioned some equipment that Comcast had installed when we added Comcast phone service previously. He said he didn't have time to correct because of another call and asked if he could come back 8:00 am the following day. I said yes. 9:30 the following day I called his work phone. Ryan said he had forgotten about me but could come back at noon. I reminded him that I had changed my work schedule and would do so again because it was critical that our phones be up. We have very poor cell service at home and a small business operating out of the house that was without phones. He said he'd be there at noon.Noon, no show. Texted and called without response. Finally at 1:30 Ryan responded that he wasn't going to make it but would ask someone else to come out. Checked back with him a couple more times without a response. At 5:00 pm I called Comcast 800# and was told a service visit was scheduled for 4:00-6:00 pm. No one showed. 8:00 pm that night I called Comcast again and was told that we had a service visit scheduled for Sunday 10:00 am. I told the person that was unacceptable for several reasons and we need to do better. He offered a $40 credit, which I said was irrelevant and asked to speak with a manager. The supervisor came on the line. I explained the situation and he said he would try and get someone out sooner. After 30 mins on and off hold he came back and asked if we were a multi-family home or property manager. I said ""no, single family that has been a Comcast customer for 10 years."" He said he would need to send me over the multi-family property. I repeatedly asked him not to do that because I had no hopes they could help and simply needed an appointment sooner. He said he could be trusted and tried to get them on the line but couldn't. He gave me a ticket # for the current escalated issue and said someone would call back within 2 hours guaranteed. I told him we were on Eastern time but I would stay up to wait. No call ever came.My wife called the next day. We were told the service visit was still scheduled for Sunday. She was on the line for some time trying to get it moved up. She was told someone would need to call back to reschedule and that would take place within the house. No call ever came. Friday, she called and we were told soonest possible was Sunday 10:00 am. We decided to wait.Sunday AM, I'm waiting around for the service tech. At 10:30 I called Comcast and hear on the automated system that we have no visits scheduled. Reached a person and that was confirmed. After explaining the situation they transferred me to the phone and internet department. I spoke with someone and reviewed the situation in detail. Was told again that phone problems take precedent and this didn't make sense based on our experience. She explained that the service call was cancelled on April 9th but couldn't say why but asked if we had cancelled it. I was speechless. I confirmed with her that we are listed as a single family home and she said she didn't understand why a supervisor couldn't get us a visit sooner. She transferred me to tier-2. I worked with a new person who explained that the soonest they could get someone to us would be Wednesday. I said that I couldn't accept that. After some time on hold that was changed to Monday 9:00-12:00 am. Monday AM 2 service techs arrive and fix the problem in 5 mins by reconnecting the wiring properly. Comcast has achieved converting a loyal customer who uses all Comcast services for home and business into someone who will be reviewing other options. I know you have complex systems and products but the complete lack of respect and execution are beyond comprehension. Whether my accounts remain with Comcast will be based on a response from an executive within your company."
"Milton of Westminster, CO",42473,1,"In general most companies who offer a service to the public struggles with providing world class customer service. My company is no different. There are many contributing factors that plays into companies not being able to obtain such lofty goals. Factors like the employee pool companies have to hire from. There is also poor management decisions making that don't always lead to providing the best customer service. However, after my recent experience with Comcast I find it hard to believe that there is another company out there who provides worst customer service as they do. Back in February I was forced to get Comcast service because my apartment complex switched their cable service to them. I signed up for their deal which meant I had to keep the service for a year. In March I move out of the complex. I called up Comcast and let them know I would be discontinuing their service because I was moving to a new location. I let them know that a different TV provider was already available at my new location therefore I would no longer be need them. I let them know there would be an early termination fee. I was given the termination fee amount plus what I owed on my final bill for the service I had. I paid the bill on March 27th and I turned my equipment in on March 28th. When I turned my equipment in, to my surprise, I was told I would receive a $71.00 refund. On April 8th I received a new billing statement from them. My bill was $32.62. I called them and ask for an explanation for the bill. At first, I tried the chat route, which was pointless because they don't have access to any notes that are placed on an account. I then called their billing department. I was told that I should have to pay the $32.62 because I moved to a location that already had TV service available. I was then transferred to their win back department to get my issue resolved. That agent was even more clueless than the first two agent I spoke with. She was very unrelenting in her position that I was not going to get a refund and I had to pay the $32.62 bill. Problem is at that point I didn't even want the refund anymore. I was more concerned about how I had been provided with misinformation by at least four different agents. I also wondered why there were never any notes on my account from the previous times I had called in. Again, the agent was not very apologetic at all. Her only comeback was that I was responsible for the $32.62. I have since paid the bill but because of the agent's lack of empathy and Comcast sense of disorganization (one department not know what the other department is doing) I will never use their service again even if I have to pay double for another service provider."
"Janice of Fresno, CA",42473,1,"First, a little personal information. I am disabled and on a fixed income. I can't afford cable TV and need Internet to keep in touch with the outside world -- this isn't a luxury item for me. I signed up with Comcast Xfinity online, bought a modem, and scheduled an installation for Monday, April 4, 2016. I get a reminder call about the appointment and the technician showed up on time -- things are looking promising. After looking around the tech discovers that there isn't actually any wiring to my unit -- something Comcast was already aware of, I found out later. He tells me that someone will have to come dig a trench and run a line from the nearby box. He also says that it shouldn't take long, and his supervisor says to call Comcast if I haven't heard from them in 3-4 days. When I don't hear anything I use Comcast's online chat function on 4/7/2016 only to find out that nothing has been done and there are no notes in my file as to what needs to be done. The first rep is clueless but the second finally seems to get it and sets up an appointment for the next day which she promises will be for both the digging and installation. Of course when the technician shows up on 4/8/2016 he hasn't been told that this is anything but a simple install and can do nothing. At this point I start calling Comcast and raising hell. Each time I call I speak to a different person and each tells me a slightly different story.Hope appears on Sunday 4/10/2016 when, after more fruitless calls, I am called by a very nice Comcast woman whose job is resolving big Comcast ** (not her words). She is sympathetic and apologetic and seems genuinely determined to get everything sorted out for me. She says she'll get the process going that day and vows to keep in touch. She also tells me that I can reach her through their main number.The following day I hear that things are in the system to get the survey, trenching, and installation done, but no appointments have been made yet and I don't get any of this information directly from my ""fixer."" Today, 4/12/2016 I've spoken to five different people at Comcast, none of them my supposed fixer. When I ask to speak to her Comcast says they can't transfer me to any specific person, so apparently she was lying to me too.The current word on my installation is that they'll send surveyors out tomorrow (April 13) and then the ""outside drop"" or cable laying on April 20th, sixteen days after the first attempted installation date. The actual installation date will come sometime after the drop, but they refuse to set a date because, well, the outside drop might not be done correctly and then Comcast would have to cancel the appointment -- which would be inconvenient for them. God only knows if any of these appointments will go as planned (apparently even Comcast isn't sure). I have informed Comcast that I'm done talking to multiple people and if anyone but my fixer calls I'm hanging up on them. I'm betting they keep calling. I know that filing this review will not affect Comcast in the slightest, but maybe the weight of terrible customer reviews will save at least a few people from signing up. If I had another feasible option I'd jump on it in a minute. There aren't words enough to say how much I hate Comcast at this point."
"nicole of Owings Mills, MD",42473,1,"I called to speak to someone about my account and the first rep was unable to assist me. They transferred me and had me on hold for 30 min until I hung up. I called back again, and explained my frustration to the second rep who never apologized and stuck me right back into the queue. Then I was on hold for 45 min until a recording came on and said that the call center was closed and to call back another day. The phone then hung up on me. Worst ever!!! I despise Comcast! They changed their name but left the same horrible service! I wish I had another option at my community!"
"daniel of Bennington, VT",42472,1,"After several months of increased fees and cost and failed attempts to reduce the Comcast cost, I was forced to cancel their service. During this conversation I was given a date it would be cancelled and told that my e-mail would still be good for 60 days. 6 days later, my e-mail access was denied. After numerous hours, phone calls, text conversations and visiting a store 60 miles away, the only thing Comcast can say is that they made a mistake, that the communication of their representatives was uninformed and that they can do nothing to restore my 5 years of lost e-mails stored. One representative told me he could offer a reduced price to sign back up with them while another told me he could do nothing unless I provided proof of who I was and a death certificate proving that my mother died as her name was on the account. Unimaginable statements that you simply can't make up. 2 customer service representatives stated that they are in agreement that their company's approach is unethical and lacks any compassion for the customer. I was given the name and number of the manager for customer service in the regions... Sheri ** in Philadelphia. Her number is **. I called several times, left messages and she never returned my calls. Not once.They have cost me countless hours of my time, lost tickets that I cannot retrieve for a scheduled chaperoned trip with my daughter and her schoolmates to DC as well as lost business/personal information that I simply can not replace. The stress, frustration, and disbelief of how I've been treated and how my situation was handled is through the roof. They lie, have no idea how to solve difficult problems and seem indifferent to real issues. I am hoping the Mr. Roberts, the CEO reads this as well as his recently appointed customer service VP, Charlie Herrin. If they do, they would have the decency to look into this debacle."
"Clarice of Avondale Estates, GA",42470,1,"From the very start I have had billing problems with Comcast. They do not try to correct their oops up just tries to fast talk you as if you are that dumb and not listening. When I first received my equipment in the mail I installed it correctly but did not get a signal. I called Comcast. The rep tried sending a signal and it failed. I was told since it was a problem on their end I would not be charged for a tech to come to my home, well I was. The tech comes out and the jack that is in the room with the TV does not work so the cable was ran to a different room. The tech ordered a tech to come out the next day to fix the jack. I asked the tech ""would I be charged for this?"". He stated ""NO"", I was. I called customer service after seeing my online bill. Got the run around from the rep. Had to ask to speak to a manager. The manager did not want to honor the false information given by their employees. All she did was half off. No fair because I would had the extra fees if it was not for their people but fine I settled. I go online and pay my bill in full now. I have a bill showing I had previous unpaid fees as well as the charges for them sending techs out that were on the first bill that I paid. I'M DONE! Comcast has just lost a good paying customer. I advise people to stop dealing with Comcast and maybe they will get their act together and start valuing their customers that keep them in business."
"Tia of Indianapolis, IN",42470,1,"I walked in Comcast cable store on April 8, 2016. Paid $350. Walked out with my boxes. Was told to come home. Hook them up. Call to activate. I called said I had to pay $158 more. They want my bank card number I said ""no"". Walk back in the store the next day. On their end it's on here so my bill going. Said I had to call the 1800 number back. Nothing store can do. Call them back. Got to so once again for 3 hours - got nowhere. I did well - I got to come out on Sunday 2-4. It's now Sunday. Waited all day - nothing. Called. Was on hold for 1 hour to hear them say ""It's on April 18"". A week and a half of giving you guys $350 and I am getting nothing. Everyone don't get Comcast. They take your money and don't give you service or your money back. I will contacts attorney."
"Erin of New York, NY",42470,1,"I cancelled my service within the time frame to receive MY 30-day money back guarantee. This April and I still have not received my check. I've talked to several customer service representatives and all confirmed that it would be in 4-6 weeks. However, it's been two months now! When I called today the representative told me it was NEVER sent. What do you mean it was never sent??? HOW CAN YOU OPERATE A BUSINESS LIKE THIS? NO ONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE. So if you expect to work with a company of integrity, this is not the one. DO NOT TRUST THEM. If you work for Comcast quit. You are more than a crappy business with a terrible process."
"Dave of Eagan, MN",42469,3,"When watching Comcast television shows I sometimes need to use the on-demand feature to catch up on the show I missed. When doing this I take note of the length of the show and whether the show can be fast forwarded through commercials. I try to not watch shows that can't be fast forwarded but occasionally it's necessary. If I wait more than a week, some shows have less commercials and show up as a shorter time than they had when originally aired. Lately I've noticed that Comcast lies about the length of the shows it shows on on-demand. One hour shows are presented as 45 minutes, but when viewed, the on-demand show continues to stretch out in time to 55 to 56 minutes in length. They pretend to cut commercials but really do not. I suppose this stops a lot of people from buying DVR's."
"Linda of Sugar Land, TX",42468,1,"I signed up with this internet service just 3 weeks ago. This business and its employees have done the following negative things in just this short time: It took 10 days to set up my service because Comcast stated that someone else had service at my address, although the residence had been vacant for the past three months. A service technician set up my email, with a password, and answer to a special question without giving me the information. Took over one half hour, via phone, to resolve this matter since I did not have the password or answer to the question. Why would someone even do this? Another service technician came to my apartment building to set-up service for my neighbor. He cut my internet in the process and I was out internet for four days, which caused me lost wages due to internet being necessary for my business.After speaking to a Comcast employee via phone about the above problem, I was told I would receive a call from someone shortly. No one in fact did call back. When I finally called, I found out someone set up an appointment for me without telling me or contacting me in any way. After 4 days of no service, I finally interacted with an employee who was both intelligent and courteous. He told me about the connection problem and fixed the problem. However, I then saw a $70 charge for the visit. The phone employee stated that the charge was valid and that they are not responsible for wiring. After explaining the situation, the employee did remove the charge, but only because it happened within the first 30 days of receiving service.There have been more issues than the above, but those are the most egregious. I researched any and all internet service providers in this area and would have gone with any other service if there had actually been an option. After I move from this location, I will never again use this service unless once again I have no option."
"Robert of Ft Lauderdale, FL",42468,1,"I've never experienced such shady practices with a corporation before. I purchased an internet plan online that apparently never existed. I never received a receipt for my order, which is very unprofessional. The customer service is useless in getting anything accomplished and I feel like I have no choice but to stick with this POS company. I'm really at a loss for words at how badly I've been treated."
"Janis of Warrenville, IL",42467,1,When they started work to replace cables - they were out in the neighborhood at 10 p.m. the Saturday before Easter! Walking around people's yards! When they came out to begin work they left my gate open because it wasn't repaired correctly last fall. Instead of doing anything about it they left the gate banging in the wind! I had to climb through mud to put a brick in front of it. I called Comcast and they said a note would be on the file so the workers wouldn't leave the gate open! The next day another team was out (these are all agents of Comcast). Again the gate was left open! Again I had to walk through the mud to put the brick in front of the gate. Today is Thursday and again the brick isn't in place and crap was left in the yard. I was told someone would be here by 3:30 and it is now 6 P.M. NOBODY HAS COME! I'm now going to file a complaint with the BBB. If someone doesn't get here tomorrow I'm filing a police report!
"Arthur of Westminster, CO",42467,3,"When cable first hit the scene the most amazing thing for many people was the omission of commercial advertisements. Now Comcast charges out the ** for even basic internet service and yet they bombard their users with advertisements. Now we all know that Comcast is being afforded special compensation from the government. Our corrupt elected officials and their appointed lackeys are allowing this cable mega-giant to financially rape the general population. I as with many other people opted for elimination of telemarketing years ago. Each and every time I pay my Comcast bill I feel as though I should be filing a police report for the abuse. If I have to pay these high costs for service, I should be afforded the right to block advertisements at my discretion without impacting the quality of service provided."
"felicia of Indianapolis, IN",42466,1,"I was a new customer to Comcast for their cable services. Will all begin with I moved to a new address and I had a scheduled appointment to have it transferred the next day after I move. Well, while I was at my old address still moving and cleaning items out of my old address, a Comcast technician showed up and I asked the technician, ""Aren't you at the wrong address?"" And he proceeded to tell me that this is where the new service was set up at. Which sounded kinda awkward knowing that I set an appointment to have the services transferred to my new address and I asked the technician, ""How can you install new services when the services are still on here?"" All I need to have them transfer it to my new address.So the technician called the customer service on his phone and explain to the representative on the phone that there was a mistake made and I need to be corrected. She spoke to me directly on the phone and reschedule my appointment for the next day even though I asked her, ""Since the technician was already here and I'm only two streets from our old address, can he come over to transfer the service that he's already over in the area?"" She told me, ""No."" So I left it at that. The next day my second scheduled appointment the technician again went to my old address which I thought was hilarious because this is what happens at the first appointment so I called Comcast again and they assured me that they will take care of the issue. They're not really sure why that happened a second time so this is day number for no services.New appointment was scheduled and guess what? The same thing happened again. By this time I am like, what is going on with this company? The next attempt they didn't show up for my services again that they said that there was services in my home. What? Then they told me that the services was in someone else's name but it wasn't me, what? I just could not believe that all these things can happen with one company. Of course again has a call to find out what is the issue. Now why there's not a technician 5th time? Well the customer service again said they will send someone else out to install my cable services. By this time, I'm just like this is outrageous all I want is my services up and running. Well on the phone for another hour and clarifying that everything is correct I proceeded to say, ""Okay let's give him another shot here,"" 'cause I really want to go to another company. Well this time he didn't show up again so I spoke to another customer service rep which I thought was really good at trying to get all my questions answered but before they even have my cable service is up she's offered me more products and I was like, ""Excuse me but can I get my cable services on first then ask me if I wanted anything else?"" It was like okay another 2 hours dealing with another customer service rep from Comcast. The next day I come home to more boxes from Comcast boxes I can't even use because my service isn't on. Insane, I know. Well this is now a 7th time. Guess what? Finally there's a technician and he proceeded to install my cable services until he tells me, ""Well now we have to run. Oh my new bill line in your home that's going to be a $30 charge."" Are you serious? After all the stuff I went through with customer service you will turn around and charge me more money on a job you guys suppose to do weeks ago. ""Fine,"" I said. I'll pay for it just please get the service is up and running. Then they were up and running. What's in 1 hour, my cable services went down. The two boxes in my bedroom with both froze up. This is ludicrous! What is that hell going on with this company? So now I have to waste more time call them back which I did and they said they will send someone out in two days. Anyhow if they would credit my bill for $20? What only $20? I've been trying to get this thing up and running for weeks and all you offer me is $20 off my bill. I thought it was $20 if they didn't come or if they're late, so I should have over $100 taken off my bill for the services. Okay by this point I am furious. I contact customer services complaints who Comcast which they reached out to me to try to correct the issue which I was kinda happy to hear because I wasn't getting any feedback about my issues with my cable services and they offered me a whopping $30 off my bill. I thought it was a joke so now in total that's supposed to be $50 off my bill but guess what people I only got $30 off my bill the other $20 I was promised by the other rep didn't happen.Well then my first bill came and guess what is a whopping $228. What I've had my services on for only 17 days and I have a bill of $228. This is too funny and the bills of a partial services I wouldn't have paid $175 within the next week then I have a new bill that came out and new bills $422. What in the world are they charging me for? So I looked at the bill they have me charged for five boxes and I only have 3 and 2 boxes they're charging me $20 a piece. What is going on with Comcast? I have had it I am now cancelling my cable services with them. This has the worse customer service.How can they continue to make the same mistakes over and over then turn around and charge you double of what your services are? I only had 135 channels plus Stars channel paid an additional $15 just for the HBO. These customer service rep should not be in this business. No longer will I deal with bad customer service. I am done dealing with Comcast in there have cited services so I am now putting my business over to DirecTV. What they are offering more channels for $100 less. So goodbye Comcast. Hello DirecTV."
"Teresa of Sherwood, AR",42466,1,"Comcast has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. They are trained people who read what is required. Their system requires you to be on the phone handed off several times until you get to a person who makes promises of a package that is never delivered. Most of the people I believe aren't US Citizens because of their accents. There is a language barrier, a lack of respect. They will interrupt and have a rude undertone while reading ""polite"" scripted words that are untrue to their demeanor. It's obvious that they don't care and hand you off a million times, hoping you get frustrated and hang up. They lie to meet quota and I only hope that my area will have more cable options in the future."
"yvette of Scranton, PA",42465,1,"I am so disgusted with Comcast. You have come to PA, taken over and now have removed channels (yankee) - channel from the guide. Don't understand how you are saying they are charging you so much when you are doing the same to your customers. How sad this is becoming with Comcast doing whatever you want and we are being charged so much for your service. So the channel is charging you for something your customers enjoy and you are doing to us what you say they are trying to do to you. So sad."
"Marie of Hollywood, FL",42464,1,COMCAST IS CHARGING ME FOR CHANGING PROGRAM WHEN I MOVED ALTHOUGH I ASKED TO REMAIN ON THE SAME PROGRAM AS BEFORE. They told me they would remove that charge and now refuse to do so. They are a very crooked company. They should be put out of business.
"Daniel of Deptford, NJ",42464,1,"Buyer beware, I got new services yesterday and today I get a call about a very old bill and was told if that bills not paid in full my services would be cut and immediately they were. Corporate stated they are powerless against the collection team and can do nothing. Unbelievable. They should be put out of business for that kind of customers treatment."
"Bridget of Montgomery, IL",42464,1,Unfortunately where I live I have Comcast cable Š—– not only is it ridiculously overpriced but the service is terrible. A few weeks ago I started losing all of my HD channels. I contacted Comcast to report the problem and of course the customer service representative could not figure out the problem and said a technician needed to come to my house. I specifically asked if I was going to be charged for this since it was an issue with the cable and was told that as long as the problem was due to the cable and not the wiring in my house there would be no charge Š—– even though they were attempting to have me add some ridiculous protection plan. Technician comes out and has to change the boxes again (second time in less than 2 years) and lo and behold I get my bill which has a charge for the technician. Of course I contact Comcast again only to speak to another customer service representative and a supervisor who cannot help me even though they can see that I didn't sign anything stating I would be charged and that they understand I was told I wouldn't be charged but there is nothing they can do about it. The customer service is terrible and apparently no one who works at Comcast is able to provide answers or assistance.
"Niomi of Spanaway, WA",42463,1,"Xfinity tries to deceive you by their commercials that say you can do all this cool crap with their X1, but it freezes CONSTANTLY! Here's an idea! Don't come out with a product unless it is able to function properly. I have to unplug the box at least once a day just to get it to half a** work again. We pay $150 a month for cable that barely works! I think this company might actually give me a heart attack because my blood literally boils every time this darn thing acts up!"
"Artist of Decatur, GA",42463,1,"Having only 2 options to choose from in tv and internet service providers is close to a monopoly... Comcast has the worst possible customer service I've ever experienced, and the other company is not far behind. Comcast isn't even interested in meeting minimal customer service... they are just interested in profits! Look carefully at your monthly bills, Comcast sneaks fees and charges, so beware!! What the tv and wireless industries needs are a few companies who care about their reputation as moral, honorable and socially conscious businesses who give a damn. Anyone out there?"
"Eric of Miami, FL",42462,1,I have been experience service outages in my area. The worse thing about the situation is that when you call they tell you everything is working and that the problem is with the connections in your home. After several calls they finally admit that there was an outage. This company's DNA consist mainly of lying to their customer.
"MD of Miami Gardens, FL",42462,1,"I scheduled a service visit because my Comcast internet and phone service is out more than it is working. My house number is clearly displayed and there were two vehicles parked in the front yard. I was waiting and watching for the technician's arrival. The technician arrived at my home - backed into my driveway - and never got out of the vehicle, made no attempt to approach my front door or make contact with anyone in the house. I thought he/she was gathering items and preparing to get out of the vehicle, so I anticipated a knock on the door. After a few minutes I went to the door to check, and the technician began to pull away from the driveway. I ran outside and the technician continued to drive away. I immediately contacted Comcast to advise of this incident. I spoke with someone in a call center in another state who couldn't help me. There was no supervisor to speak with, no recourse except to reschedule another appointment at my inconvenience! I received a voice message from Comcast stating that because I missed the technician I must reschedule. Customer service from Comcast is non-existent!"
"John of Seaford, DE",42460,1,"I really cannot stand this company. Signed a contract in March 2015 for 24 months at 109.00 plus taxes and all the other happy **. Well in March of 2016 they raise my base bill $25.00. Explanation by the rep that is policy after a year. Why did I sign a contract for 2 years for? She didn't want hear it. So I filed a complaint with the FCC. Comcast got back with me, the rep said he will look into it and call me back later in the day. A week passed, I called and left a message, no return call. Finally called again and got the rep on the phone. He said he would lower the bill to what it was. My account online does not match what he said. I tried to call back, left a message and still no return call. Is this a way to run big company? I think not. Comcast needs to change their name to Comcrap."
"S. of Bartlett, IL",42460,1,"I am currently a Comcast customer of 36 years and have an internet and TV only package with no contract. I was endeavoring to reduce my package cost and I planned to have Comcast internet service only and installation of a free HDTV antenna. I initially called Comcast on March 19 to ask for a reduced price for internet service only, which they quoted as $66.95. The service rep. (Brandy) offered me a less expensive Triple Play Package (Internet-TV-Home phone) for $109.99 even though I didn't want a phone. I initially agreed to this option because it had no term contract and I had a 30-day period in which to change my mind.3 days later, I received a flyer in the mail for Xfinity Comcast advertising an internet and TV double package for $89.99 per month for 2 years with a 2-year contract. I called again March 26 and spoke to a Jaybrianna, and asked why I wasn't offered the Double Play for $89.99 as advertised in the flyer, and she agreed to switch me to the new service. However, she couldn't complete the process at that precise moment (because the Triple Play Package hadn't closed out in their system) so she agreed to call me back on Monday, March 28, to verify the transaction. By Wednesday, March 30, I hadn't received the promised return phone call, so I called Comcast to verify that the transaction had been completed.I asked to speak again to Jaybrianna, the previous customer rep and was informed by the new agent whose name was Bhilib in Customer Solutions (1.800.934.6489) that he couldn't switch the call to a specific agent. I discussed with him the details of what had previously been agreed to and was informed by him that the offer wasn't available in my area and he suggested I go on to the Xfinity website to see what bundles were available. Following his advice, I found the exact advertised bundle for $89.99 as per the flyer. I contacted Comcast again the same day, March 30th, and the agent (her name was Jackie) I spoke with informed me that the ""$89.99 bundle was Xfinity Latino and available only to Spanish speaking people but they couldn't put that in the flyer!"" I was then offered the same bundle for $99.99 ($10.00 extra because I speak English!!).This is discriminatory in that the cost of the service varies with ethnicity!!! In fact, this is blatant anti-Americanism for the sake of commercial and financial gain. This is false advertising in that the Xfinity Comcast advertisement flyer is printed completely in English, it contains not one word of Spanish that I could find and must be construed as a bait and switch scam! I.e. a customer is attracted by the offer but is then told it is not available and is vulnerable to being persuaded to purchase another, yet more costly package. Misleading information and contradictory information from representatives of Comcast who seem purposely intent on unscrupulous bait and switch tactics. Once they have discerned that you are persistent in your complaint you are promptly treated as a nuisance.Although I am annoyed at the manner in which Comcast has behaved, I personally retain the ability to negotiate my way through their unscrupulous tactics. My concern is not only for my present negotiations but for those people who may be more gullible or susceptible to these sales ploys. It is a dishonest and devious tactic that places the unaware or uninformed at financial risk through deceptive practices for commercial profit and gain. I am well aware that large corporations like Comcast can easily dismiss the individual complaint and with very little regard to the individual. Yet I am so deeply concerned about these dubious sales tactics on the uninitiated that I feel compelled to bring it to as many people's attention as possible.I am forwarding this letter to persons and parties who may find this of deep concern and act accordingly for the benefit of us all, including: Federal Communications Commission, Better Business Bureau, Comcast Facebook page, Village of Bartlett, IL, Local Housing Associations, Chicago Times, Consumer Affairs, AT&T, and other competitors."
"Carri of New Castle, IN",42459,1,"I had Comcast for over 10 yrs. They kept slowly raising my bill, they would do it $5 at a time so it's not real noticeable at first. After calling them and trying to work something out such as ""do you have any promotions for existing long term customers"", no they didn't. We could not reach a resolution or shall I say they kept giving me the runaround. I dropped them & went to Dish. We had them for over 15 yrs. We then moved from that home and we were approached by a Comcast rep (I have his name, store number and the contract or hand written offer). So the offer was triple play (internet, cable & security) for 24 months for 99.99. I drilled this guy over and over because I knew that was a really good deal. He wrote everything up, assured me & my husband that it was legit and the triple play was for a full 24 months for 99.99. So we agreed to give it a try. So it was installed Feb 2015, installer was very knowledgeable & showed us the equipment, how to use all of it. From that point on it has been downhill. Internet goes out daily, called & they sent out a repair guy. Again very customer friendly worked on the inside & checked the outside. Off he went, he gave me his phone number said to call if problems. He wasn't gone 20 min and the internet was out again. Called him and he had forgotten to reset something. No problem, he told me how to do it. So off we go. Internet when it is working is very fast however over the course of the next year almost daily if not daily, it was every other day the internet goes out, cable freezes. I had done this so many times I knew how to reset from home, but if it didn't work then I had to call and they sent a signal to my equipment & they could see I wasn't getting signal. Customer service reps are incredibly nice and offer the utmost kindness and seem genuine. Now fast forward to Feb 2016, received my bill and it is 124.99 not 99.99. So I called again, spoke to 2 different guys. Come to find out my 24-mo contract according to them is only on my security, my cable & internet not so it's now 124.99. I finally got to a ""supervisor"", spoke to him Gabriel, went through the whole thing again. He told me he couldn't help me. I asked if they had any promotions for existing customers & I was told ""no only new customers,"" so I said ""you will offer someone you don't know a promotion but a good paying customer who has never been late or had disconnect notices you cannot help."" He said ""that is right."" Finally after several more minutes on the phone he said they could give me back the 24.99 a month but it would be a lump sum beginning in March and I would have to call back quarterly to get this taken care of. They could not take the 24.99 off a month, so April, May, and June I would pay the 124.99 then would have to call them back and rehash all of this again. Ok so not quite what I hoped for but at least it was something 47 minutes later. So my bill gets credited in March and initially when I checked it 48 hrs later it said negative 80.00. I knew that wasn't right either, so I waited another 24 hrs, checked again & there was a balance of approx. $80.00 and some odd cents. So I pay that bill, now here we are and my bill comes in for April, it says I owe $280.00!!! They added the 99.99 back on my bill so it looks like now that I didn't pay my bill last month, well I paid $80 of the 180. So on 3/28/16 I called them again, spoke to Larry, he can see that Gabriel had credited then put back on, explained it all again. He tells me that he has to talk with his supervisor Keith that this should have never been done this way and wants to make it right but they will need to review. I said ""pull the phone records you will see exactly what was said."" He said that is what they would do and call me on 3/29/16 after 4pm central time. Here I am 5 hrs later and no call. I would not recommend Comcast to anyone. They do not honor what they sell you, they do not call you back when they say they will, you can't get anyone to help. This is a multimillion dollar company and they are going to lose a good paying customer for 24.99 a month. Here's the kicker - if cancel the internet and cable (because I'm not on contract according them) then my security doesn't work because it is run off the internet and I still have to pay for the security service that I can't use because I'm under contract with them, or if I don't pay it my credit rating is ruined. I do not know how these people lay their heads down at night knowing they are selling a product that doesn't exist and then taking advantage of good honest people who work and pay their bills. DO NOT USE COMCAST. THEY ARE A FRAUD!"
"Cheryl of Utica, IL",42458,1,"We (my husband and I) are trying to disconnect our mother's cable TV service due to her new residence in a nursing home. Comcast is anything but helpful in this issue. Our mother can not talk and is paralyzed due to a stroke, which is why she is now in a skilled nursing facility. We have called Comcast a total of 4 times so far and have been told different service discontinuance requirements each time. Twice we were disconnected while our call was being 'transferred'. We could have lied to the service representatives (mom died or I could have pretended to be mom) and they would have shut off her service. Because we opted to be truthful, we can not get her service turned off. First, they wanted a letter from the nursing home declaring residency of our mother. So, I trotted down to the nursing home and had the administrator type up and sign a letter with the date of residency and the residents name. When I called back to get the fax number (you have acquire a fax number and fax the info while on the line with the representative), I was told I needed a power of attorney letter. When I ask what type of POA form, the representative, Dominque, did not know and became very nasty on the phone. Did she say anything out of line, No, it was all in her one-word answer to my questions and her snippy tone of voice. I ask for her supervisor and she told me she would not transfer me until I sent in the form. I then ask what would happen if we did not pay the bill. Well, it turns out, Comcast will shut off the service. Go figure that! I am boxing the equipment, which is identifiable by the serial number to customer account number, and dropping it off at the UPS store. Mom's nursing home does not receive cable from Comcast (they do not have service in the area). This did not matter. Lesson learned: Comcast is horrible to deal with! Just try and get a loved one's service shut off for a medical reason..."
"Erica of Antioch, TN",42458,1,Comcast charged me for service that I wasn't able to use. I turned in my boxes on Feb 2 and they billed me until I called back in on Feb 28th after I received a bill that told me that they were still billing me. Let not forget to add that they billed me a 300 early termination fee after I have been a customer for 6 years and never missed a payment. I have paid Comcast over 400 in three months in order to ensure the they don't turn me over to collection when they have over billed me. Unlike most of their customers I value my credit. I have called in for help with my bill over 13 times and no one has been able to help me. Someone please help me!!!
"Samantha of Ann Arbor, MI",42458,1,"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! I have had Comcast for 4 years and I have had nothing but problem after problem. The worst part is they continue to charge me and charge me for sending someone to my house or shipping to send a new box. This is YOUR (Comcast) equipment malfunction, why am I paying for you to fix the issues. I pay for the services. Maybe this is how theyre still in business??? No one is satisfied, maybe they personally make the equipment malfunction so they can charge MORE to have it fixed. When I do have an issue, it's never a quick fix! Either the customer service 'forget' to send me my equipment or 'forget' to write a comment for the next person to review. Nothing but issues and I have been dissatisfied since day one. I will 100% surely be finding another cable and Internet service provider. My last straw has been pulled! I wish I could rate LESS than one star, because that is what they deserve."
"Edward of West Jordan, UT",42457,4,"I am so unhappy with Comcast service, because my statement screw up, it not the same they promises before I took Comcast. The other thing my bill due date yesterday March 27, and I made a payment March 28, but the service already block it. What is the meaning that, or your company getting poor so you can't pay your employ, without rip off customer money. This is make me really upset. I need your response about this situation or I can sent this information to BBB. Thanks. "
"Kate of Nashville, TN",42457,1,"After Comcast mistakenly applied my payments to a three year old out of state account, four months later it is still unresolved. Every time I try to resolve with proof of payment from bank I am first routed to a call center in India then routed back to the Nashville region. Then I have to provide several different case #'s which the agent always fails to find until I provide. This company that provides internet service will only accept fax as proof of payment. WTF!!! Who has a fax machine in their home these days!!! AS INI!!!I have even emailed the VP of customer service... Not like he gives a **. No response of course. I just spent 29 minutes on the phone to get a live person. Another five minutes with someone who barely speaks English with a fake English name. Do you think this is by design? Yes of course it is!!! I am setting up a class action lawsuit with my attorneys because to add insult to injury this has impacted my credit for them losing my payments. If anyone else wishes to participate I can be reached. #xfinitysucks #helloAT&T"
"kristine of Waterbury, CT",42457,1,"I have had Comcast for nearly 18 years. I traveled out of the country to care for an ill family member and missed my payment. Comcast disconnected my service, which was fine. Then, they sent me to collections. They failed to sent me any bills or notifications. Of course, they locked me out of the electronic account so I had no way to even know what was owed or make online payment. Crappy customer service that fails to even communicate with you to give you an opportunity to pay what you owe. Just automatically send to collections, even after they failed to communicate with you when they said they would. Won't ever go back simply because of their crappy treatment of customers, even customers who want to pay what's owed."
"april of Toms River, NJ",42457,1,"I WOULD HAVE GIVEN NO STAR IF THAT WAS AN OPTION. 9 month billing error and no one can fix it. Pay on time the correct amount and on time EVERY month BUT they turned off my service twice over the discrepancy. I pay the fee to get it turned back on twice and they say they will look into it and they DON'T and keep sending me the wrong bill!!! Still being billed for a service call that never happened 9 months ago!!! Absolute disgrace of a company. Waited on hold 2 hours today for a supervisor and then got disconnected and they didn't call back. I have had it with companies treating people like this. We pay for a service and get nothing but aggravated. Use someone else, spare yourself from dealing with Comcast."
"Melissa of Crawfordsville, IN",42456,1,"I finally switched to Comcast, actually just because it saved money. Well it was the worst mistake I have even done in my life. They bill you right off so you pay for your services before you get them, which is alright, but what they don't tell you is you get one bill and then another a few days later, so two bills owed within 30 days. The real kicker is that I upgraded and added a few more channels for the cost of 9.99. Well I got that second bill in the first 30 days that was 360.00 which was minus 109.00 of the first bill. I had to scratch my head again! Okay, I accepted I received a second bill, but that bill was supposed to be 118.00 so I called them, LOL LOL, let the games begin...They didn't upgrade me with what I ordered of 9.99 because even though I could show confirmation of my order they did not offer that special any more so they ADDED WHAT THEY WANTED! That is not all... I contacted them repeatedly trying to get someone to listen to me and take those charges off. Well they won't, can't and didn't! So I have to laugh my ass off when I had to call them today and tell them I never had the DVR that the package says I should have and haven't all this time. Well guess what! For another 19.95 a month and 19.95 for shipping they will send me one. WTH! I will add -- the internet sucks worse than low signal wifi! I have super speed. Pay extra now lol. Trust me you do not want to deal with this crap, so run as fast as you can to AT&T! That is where I am headed back to:) Do not order Comcast and think you will have customer service because the joke it on you!"
"Ivan of Nashville, TN",42456,1,"My On Demand hasn't worked for a while. This is a breach of contract - I entered into contract with services outlined. This company has made zero effort to fix this problem, phone calls often loop to the wrong department and everyone refuses to transfer to a supervisor (who half the time is just as horrible anyway). The chat option is just as bad - I told them I was screenshotting our conversations and after the agent insisted my cable was in service, I asked for a supervisor. Repeatedly. I kept asking and informing the agent, ""Angela"" of the screen shots, so she eventually disconnected my internet, ending our chat.Somehow, my next attempts to logon the chat kept refreshing. I tried the phone again, irate, but swallowing my fury, as this company has trained me so well in doing. My phone attempts were just as stupid, with agents transferring me to the wrong department, presumably purposely. Finally, someone who seemed like she at least received a GED gave me false hopes and pretended to transfer me to a supervisor only to hang up on me. My cable still isn't fixed and every attempt to talk to someone loops me in endless explanations of my problem to wrong departments or leads to disconnected chats."
"Chris of Orinda, CA",42455,1,"Just terrible. Super expensive and the worst service ever. I pay for 72 mbps and I get 28. I call for tech support and they say, ""sure we can send someone out to help."" He gets here, and can't help. He said they should have never sent him out. Then, they charge for that visit. Back to the internet. Only one side of the house gets service. Their solution... pay for a second internet subscription. They would love that I am sure. Even with both modems and routers I still wouldn't get 72 mbps. Cancelling and NEVER COMING BACK... EVER!"
"David of St Clair Shores, MI",42455,3,"I just switched to Xfinity from U-verse. The DVR from Xfinity is in one word ""terrible"" as compared to the DVR from U-verse. The issues that I have discovered about the DVR is: when you record a 30-minute program, it only records 29 minutes. If you record a program that is 60 minutes long it only records 59 minutes. You must go and add in 1 or 5 minutes to record the tail end of a program. U-verse automatically adds on 2 minutes. There is no ""STOP"" button on the remote just a pause/play button. If you are watching a recorded program and you decide to stop and delete it you have to pause it, go back to the Xfinity button, go to saved programs, select the program highlight, and delete it. Then you have to permanently delete it. Too many steps. U-verse has a stop button and you can delete it immediately. Another issue I have is that there is no list of programs (series) that you can review from time to time to see if you don't want to record anymore. U-verse has that feature. The reason I canceled U-verse is that they don't honor their year contract policy. My policy year ends in February and by December they had started to raise my rate. Raised it again in January. I kept my end of the deal, but they don't!"
"olga of Miami, FL",42455,1,"With Xfinity I experience constant outages that their Department cannot fix. They send supervisors over and still no results. Xfinity is terrible. They do not have control of their area and they continue to have outages in Kendall and I'm on contract and when it's over, I'm out of here. This is been happening since day one. I have been on the phone with Xfinity for hours. This is getting so ridiculous that my internet goes off every day and my TV freezes and we can't even watch TV. I do not recommend Xfinity. It's horrible."
"Zac of Murfreesboro, TN",42454,1,"Ok, this is going to be rather long since I have spent roughly 14 total hours on the phone over the past couple weeks dealing with Comcast agent after Comcast Agent to Supervisors, Managers, and as of today Executive Customer Service Members. Comcast is by far the worst company I have ever had the unfortunate displeasure dealing with. The lack of respect, the extreme rudeness, and the way they lie right through their teeth is ridiculous. I mean is Comcast post jobs that require past experience as Lawyers? Let me break down my experience for you all. I also recorded all the calls that I had with them and once I get them compiled I will be posting that somewhere as well. If anyone has a good venue to post those calls that will be more effective against Comcast please share your thoughts and opinions on the matter.So here it goes. I have used Comcast for a while now, purely for Internet Service. I then received a Promotional Flyer for the ""2 Year Fixed Rate Agreement"" for Comcast Blast Internet (Which I currently had) and Comcast TV and X1 DVR. The promotion 2 year fixed rate terms according to the flyer was that for $99/mo, I would receive Blast Internet, TV with the X1 DVR included... I talked it over with my wife (same day as the promotion came to the house) and since we were already paying $79/mo just for the Blast Internet alone, we decided that it would be nice to have the DVR and watch some TV every now and then...I called the number on the flyer and told them that I had the promotion that I was holding in my hand, and they said yes absolutely and I agreed to the terms and all was good. A week later my DVR and TV just go black and I call Comcast to fix the issue. They said that I do not have TV service and that the DVR is not included in the promotion and that the particular promotion I was talking about was no longer being offered. I told the lady that I had already agreed to the terms last week when they came out to do the install and she disregarded what I said completely and told me that if I wanted to have the DVR service that I would have to go through the agreement which was now listed at $109/mo and that she would send out a technician to do the installation.I had to explain to her once again that we already have the X1 DVR installed in our house, and that the reason I was calling was to have someone fix it because the picture would not show up and the sound would spit out intermittently. This conversation went back and forth for about 3 hours, and finally I had enough and said fine I would agree to the 2 year fixed rate of $109/mo. The lady said she would have a technician out there between a 4 hour window tomorrow morning... Tomorrow morning came then afternoon... I called Comcast once again and spent another 3 hours on the phone with them because they would not listen to what I was telling them.I told this lady that I was expecting a technician to come out because the picture on my DVR was out and it was spitting out sound randomly, and that I have already gone through this process of trying to send refresh signals to the box, and that it is not the issue and does not resolve anything, which is why the technician was scheduled to come out in the first place. So she decided to ignore what I said, and started sending refresh signals and I told her another time that will not do any good and that the only thing I need is the actual technician to come out and look at the box itself.I am an IT person and I have a decent understanding of the differences between Software and Hardware issues, and this particular issue is not something that can be handled remotely. She put me on hold while she read her report that she got back from the signal refresh, and to her complete surprise it seemed (and now 3 hours into the call) she said ""I think that there might be something with the X1 DVR box itself because the refresh signals are not working..."" I was completely blown away... I had repeatedly told her exactly what was going on for the last 3 hours but anyways, she said that she would schedule a technician to come out and I got the confirmation number and waited the next day for the technician to come out... no show.I called Comcast yet again, and they told me that they had cancelled the technician appointment because one of the agents in the middle of night, reviewed my account, and sent a refresh signal and it said that everything was working, so they cancelled the appointment... I was furious but stayed professional and had to go through yet another round of what's what and why this is not working and why they need to send a technician... At this point I am ready to tell them forget it and just pick the dang thing up, when oh wow, they finally listen to what I have to say and schedule the technician to come out.The technician finally came out and took one look at the X1 DVR box and said ""Yeah here is your problem... You have an outdated X1 DVR and they are not supported anymore (Keep in mind I just ordered the X1 DVR service a matter of days before, and they gave me an unsupported X1 DVR)."" Well this technician replaced the DVR and everything was up and running. I was ok, well that was a pain but at least it is over now. WRONG. I got my bill and they had charged me for the technician that came out and the ones that didn't, plus they were charging me the standard rate of service for both Internet and TV. According to the bill, there was not a promotion rate or agreement applied to my account. Needless to say I was really fed up, and then spent 6 hours on the phone bouncing from one agent to the other, getting bumped to hold, then handed off to another agent and finally got a supervisor.I explained everything to her and she actually was apologetic and said she would take care of it, and said that my total fixed monthly rate for the 2 year agreement would be $133.20 and it would not be changed. So at this point I was somewhat ok, and checked my account again and it says I had past dues still on the account for a technician and a month of service. I have called many times within the last 2 months to clear this up, and finally got to the point where I just told them flat out that I will pay what I owe, which is the amount that I agreed to of $133.20. I will not pay a single penny more. The issue was then escalated to the ""Executive Branch of Customer Service"" which is an even bigger joke..Now we are at present date, I spoke with Eric **, Executive Customer Relations of Comcast Corporate. I told him what had happened and his response to me was that I do owe what they are saying and that the fixed rate agreement isn't a fixed rate agreement and had the audacity to tell me that Comcast has never sent out a promotion with the details that I had been talking about. I was floored, this guy basically called me a liar after all that has been going on. Well needless to say, that comment changed the dynamic of the call, and I finally told them that I have been recording all the calls that I have had with Comcast, I have retained all the emailed correspondence and I still have the ""Promotion Flyer"" flyer that apparently ""NEVER"" existed.He then went to say that he has worked at Comcast for 11 years and that they have never sent out a flyer with those terms and basically said that I would have have to fabricate the flyer myself or someone else did or what not and I was beyond mad already. But then I heard it. This guy had me on speaker in his office and another guy in the office was LAUGHING!!! I had enough. I told Eric that I would be posting all of my experiences with Comcast over the past 3 months online and that I will continue to pay $133.20 as I agreed to, but will not be paying a single cent more, and if they decide to interrupt my services, I will take that as a violation of the agreement and will leave the contract void at which point they would lose me as a client and I would voice my opinion and experience to anyone I come in contact with even thinking about Comcast, and I hung up and am now posting here.I know that was a long story, but believe me living through it was much longer. I shortened this review up as much as possible without losing the details. Like I said at the beginning I was like a venue for the phone conversations that were recorded if anyone has additional places you are aware of, please let me know and I will post there as well. Something has to be done about Comcast. The monopoly is ridiculous and I know that Fiber Optics are coming soon, and I can't wait because we can finally be free of Comcast/Direct TV/ and Dish which one is no better than the other. They are all terrible. If you by chance want to reach out to Eric ** at Comcast Executive Customer Relations his number is **."
"russ of Suwanee, GA",42454,1,"To say that I despise Comcast would be the biggest understatement I have ever made. This company who I actually liked at one time have been so completely worthless over the last 8 months yes 8 months trying to resolve multiple billing errors it is beyond belief and I will never give them a penny as long as I live. I ended my service last Aug. yet they continued to bill me thru Oct which I finally cut them off and blocked my credit card as well as reversed the charges. I made my first call about this error the first day I got the bill in Sept. 12 calls and 8 months later still no resolution. And get this they have now sent me to collections and it is showing up on my credit report. Each time on the call they begged forgiveness and promised that they would 100% take care of this. I have been promised this by a few of the following:Lucky 10-6-15. Zee 12-29-15. Karen 12-29-15 and she even gave me a confirmation # of ** that we were done. Ashley 12-30-16 finally I think it is done. Nope I then got my next collection notice on 1/20/16 but I am in Europe so I canŠ—Èt respond. Next I got to talk to 2-8-16 Jasmine. 2-8-16 Christine. 2-8-16 Joy who promised that Comcast would in fact call me back by end of business, of course that never happened. I just got back from a love trip to Europe and Asia and what do I find in my mailbox, another collection notice. So today 3-25-16 I talk to Pamala who transfers me to a supervisor Aaron. He informs me that they had made huge errors and they he will finally take care of it all. And oh by the way they still want me to pay $60.62 that they say should have been the final bill. So I asked him what the probably 20 hours of time I have spent on the phone is worth and he said ""that is unfortunate but you had service and you owe Comcast."" No apology just you owe Comcast. Then I asked about the credit reporting and he said that is automatic. We will see if anything actually happens. All I can say is that this company took a loyal customer and turned me into a zealot to tell every single person who will listen to never do business with them ever again. The fact that I am taking the time from my very busy day to write this would give you a clue how bad this entire mess has been. All I can say is NEVER EVER consider COMCAST for your cable. I got DirecTV at one of my houses and AT&T at the other and so far all is well."
"Austen of Kissimmee, FL",42454,1,"Worst ISP available. Intermittent signals with the absolute worst telephone service I have personally ever experienced. When I say intermittent signal, my internet will randomly go out. The best part is, however, I can yell into the ""security camera"" aimed inside my house to turn the signal back on, and it works! Big brother? Is that you?"
"Charles of Jacksonville, FL",42453,1,"I have only lived in Florida for 7 months and we wanted U-verse as that was by far the best in St. Louis! I have heard nothing but horror stories about U-verse down in Florida. Well I have to say that Comcast is not the worst, but I don't like how very often you get the time to restart your box message. In all the years I had U-verse, not once other than every now and then you needed to sit and be patient as the system would need to reboot, but we're talking once every 4-5 months! Also it's very strange how there is a delay when you change channels. Not sure what any of this means but when I move back to GOOD OLD ST. LOUIS, the first thing I'm doing is going back to AT&T U-verse for a better viewing experience w/better channels too!"
"Naveen of Fremont, CA",42453,1,"Hi All, Comcast Xfinity... Big fat liars. Comcast charged me $10.00 every month for the equipment they have not provided. When I realized that they over charging me every month, I reached out to Comcast. They said they are sorry and said they will refund me money back in 4 to 6 weeks. After 6 weeks they call me and says I owe them 30 plus dollars. Now I am chatting with them and they say they charged me for the equipment. I was given only setup TV box. They were also charging me for Modem which they never provided me."
"Abigail of Windsor, CA",42453,1,I had their service for many frustrating years. My last experience with them is that three months ago I moved to another state and turned my equipment in. They never turned the service off and want 590.00 for the last three months after I closed the account and sold my house. I talked to their customer service person whose voice was almost not audible in Panama. He said he would take care of it but again I got another bill asking me to pay for someone else's bill! Frustrating to deal with them.
"L. R. of Wilmington, DE",42452,2,"I made a call to Comcast because of a payment I made that it was wrong due to us writing one amount on the check and actually wrote on the writing part of the check the right amount then Comcast go by the amount that we wrote not the other amount. Our bank said to call Comcast and they may fix the problem, but from the moment I called to fix the problem with Comcast the cust serv was unprofessional and rude. They said nothing they can do that we would have to pay the difference and if I put a stop on the check I would get a fee of $25 and that's not counting what my bank would charge me so I left alone but then I wanted to see if I was to save some money. Yes. When I called last month because I wanted to see if I saved then they switch me to another amount, no contract but the difference with my equipment was a saving of $15 in which I'm not satisfied. I wished there were other cable company I can transfer to but on my area Comcast are the only one. This rude unprofessional Customer Service Gerry kept reminding we have been on the phone 45 min or 1 hr. ""This would only would have taken 30 min to me"". He sound it angry the entire conversation and just wanted to end up conversation even though we talked about other ways to save money, but in the long run I'm not saving too much and I'm not happy with this particular customer service by the name of Gerry and I didn't get a call back like it was promised 30 minutes after because I told him he was going to get rated very low. I guess they can get away with it. Right now I wish I can cancel but no other cable company on my area beside Satellite services I don't like but that would be my second option."
"Rebecca of Chicago, IL",42452,1,"Customer service is terrible! I shouldn't be required to pay a $50 installation fee for a set top box swap when the install took 5 hours. There was no service to the home due to exterior wires being cut so you had to come out for the outage. One tech worked for 3 hours, and had to call another to assist. I couldn't have done this on my own. I've been a customer for years paying $250 monthly. I wouldn't recommend Comcast to anyone just because of customer service or lack thereof."
"Kelly of Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",42452,1,"I wish I did not sign a 2-year contract with this company. I do not know how they stay in business besides lack of competition. I waited over an hour to speak to a representative. Could not get them to send me my bill for 6 months after calling repeatedly. They raised the price after a couple months because the promotional price ends, which I was never informed of. I got quoted a priced and after I complained about my bill being much higher I was informed it was because that was an estimate. I should have read the fine print. Make sure you read every single detail of any contract they try to lock you into. They also charged me 15$ for HBO after I was given it free and asked for it to be removed. Check your bill over and over. If government cable regulations change and a company has to charge you more, I would expect a notification. Of course that thought did not occur with this company. Please do some research before choosing Comcast."
"David of Saint Johns, FL",42452,1,"Cable Removal for Construction -- Mr. Tom Karinshak my name is David ** and I'm in Jacksonville Florida. I have been trying for three weeks. Do you have someone in the residential service to disconnect your cable line from an electrical in order for me to have the electrical remove the pole in order for me to build a new home. The first day I called which one is three weeks ago. A gentleman by the name of Pete came out looked at it and said it had to go to another department and they will be in touch with me within 24 hours. That never happened. I called again and spoke with these people in one phone call, Jasman, Shanail, Julie. I was told it had to go to residential services and that someone would call me on Saturday morning March 19. Guess what? That never happened either. I called on Monday the 21st and no returned my call then. On the 22nd I spoke with James and then a young lady by the name of Janet. She told me that the job was set up on them to take the line down 3-28-2016. I let her know that would not work. I need to demo the house. I asked for her supervisor. When I did that she found this funny and chuckled on the phone, said ""hold on a minute."" After waiting another five minutes to get back on the phone and said he was not available and he will call me back within two hours. It was 2:30 Eastern time. She said his name was German **. Guess what? It is now 7:30 Eastern time and I have yet to receive his phone call. And need someone that has another authority do you contact me to remove your wire this week. I have never been forced to work with any company as incompetent as Comcast. The first work order I was given was **. Nobody with your organization can tell me what happened with that. The new work order number is **. I need someone to respond with a reasonable date to come and take your line down. My contact information is David ** or I can be reached by email at **. Now I have spent close to 7 hours between phone calls and now I have spare close to 7 hours between phone calls and this letter. Not to count the 45 minute drive to meet Pete the first day then a 45 minute drive back to my office. If you have anybody in your organization that is competent enough to do that I would appreciate them contacting me."
"Eszter of Washington, DC",42451,1,"I have been a subscriber to your internet services since Feb 15, 2016. I contacted to you add a digital TV service on March 3, asking for a package that includes news channels. Round 1: The agent over the phone assured me that the proposed package would include news channels. He informed me that I would have the service in 72 hours, with the set-top box delivered.Round 2: I called again after 5 days (March 7) and nothing happening, to find out that my order got lost. After a very long phone call I agreed with another agent that I order the package the price of which went up (from 64 to 69 dollars). I had to wait 72 hours and the service would work. Later I received two obsolete set-top boxes (I asked for one box, presuming all boxes are HDMI-enabled). When I put the system together, I found no news channels.Round 3: I chatted online. In the end I was reassured in writing by Juvy Lyn ** Comcast customer care specialist on March 9 that the Preferred Double Play with Blast 150 Mbps speed for $89.99/month for 12 months promotion has been successfully added on my account. Notice the price hike. I sent back the two obsolete set-top boxes.Round 4: I did not receive anything in 5 days. I called and a very helpful agent named Chris informed me that the sending of the HD set-top box was put on hold and my order to change the service to include news channels was lost. He proceeded to clean up the mess for me. After a phone call that lasted about an hour, he subscribed me to Starter Double Play (price hiked to 98 dollars) and set the HD set-top box on route. I was expected to get the service working by March 21.Round 5: On March 21, after setup, my TV displayed only that this set-top box is no longer active. I chatted online with an agent who solved the problem, but with the picture, two other problems surfaced: no sound whatsoever and the news channels missing. These channels are missing even though the previous day I had received email confirmation that I was now a subscriber to the Starter Double Play package, which includes Digital Starter, a compilation with news channels.Round 6: Today upon turning on the TV all I could see was the Š—“This set-top box is no longer active.Š— message, despite yesterdayŠ—Ès troubleshooting. I have lost my patience with you. This should be a simple business: I order the service, you deliver, I pay for it. As things stand, I order the service, you donŠ—Èt deliver, I pay more and more for it. At each contact with you, I had to explain all my Comcast issues from the start. Each phone call and chat lasted at least half an hour.At each conversation, I ask you to correct the misspelling of my first name. Each time you promise. It is still misspelled. Under normal circumstances, I would have quit Comcast already. As you have monopoly in my building, I cannot do it. But I expect some sort of a compensation for this lack of professionalism, the wasted hours over the phone and chatting, and the distress it caused. The least you can do is to send a professional to my home and have the system set up perfectly and without any further cost to me. I am looking forward to your reply. My next step is filing a complaint with the US customer protection body."
"sam of Cheshire, CT",42450,1,"Called Comcast Friday, February 18, 2016 at 5:00. Was on the phone with them for about 55 minutes telling the customer service rep that I wanted to cancel my basic cable service. He made an attempt to try to get me to bundle my internet and cable telling me it would be cheaper. It told him I don't need the cable since I get anything I need using an HD antennae. After several attempts at trying to get me to not cancel, he put me on hold and never came back. My guess is he didn't want this cancellation on his name so he hung up on me."
"Polo of Cordova, TN",42450,1,On today a tech came out which from the jump I could tell was a rookie... He states my apartment needs rewiring and I can't have that done until Saturday... and top it all off dude steals my tv remote. Upon making several calls to his phone which he just previously called me from he won't answer nor return my calls... so now I have no cable nor can I watch Netflix... I hate a theft!!!
"Claudia of Delray Beach, FL",42448,2,"This company changes the channels to get you frustrated so you have to pay for upgrades in the service. They remove your favorite channel and replace it for the worse one possible. Their intention is to force you to get upgrades. This changes happened several times with my service. They recently removed History channel from my service which is one of my family's favorite. We used to watch it together and enjoy fantastic story telling and the great knowledge from instructional programs that it offered. Well they replaced it with ""Vice"". Vice is a channel where all you see is people doing drugs, partying and getting wasted. Unbelievable! I wonder what kind of people can take decisions like this and live happy with themselves."
"Nicole of Seaford, DE",42448,1,"My experience with Comcast was like something out of a horror movie. First they was late, real late, then they left without hooking up all my services, then I call back only to hear them tell me a technician would be back until the next day. I don't recommend this company."
"Beth of Aurora, CO",42446,1,"When I signed up for the 2 year contract I was told on the phone that my bill would not change for 2 years. That is a lie. After a year, my bill went up by $20.00. I was told that I was getting a discount for the equipment, but that discount was only for one year, not the two years that I was sold. When I asked the Comcast rep over the phone where that information was in writing, it turns out there is nothing in writing that he could provide to me. I plan to write Comcast and have them tell me that in writing."
"Amanda of Grayson, GA",42445,1,"Shory story: Xfinity has horrible customer service, logistics, and they are happy that way. Run or your wallet become the Xfinity ATM; meanwhile you will wonder why your rear hurts. Long story: I should have known Xfinity was a bad idea when they couldn't get my order right. Then entered it twice, so I had two shipments of boxes and parts, some of which weren't even part of my package. They charged me for all of it even though I rejected the boxes that weren't part of my cable package as soon as they arrived. I had to argue with customer service over the course of weeks to clear that up.They tried to charge me a monthly fee for using a router that was not part of my order. Then tried to charge me for using my own router. That was another week of disputes until I sent them the receipt of purchase. The router doesn't even look like the one they use. Then, include the random billing. Apparently, if paying through the ""convenient"" app, paying the full amount of the bill isn't really the full amount of the bill. My bill jumped quite a bit, when I called in, they informed me that I did not pay the full bill amount. What? Apparently they can add amounts after the fact. The math didn't add up, but as the customer, you are pretty much ** up as far as they are concerned."
"Eugene of Portland, OR",42444,1,"I am receiving billing for charges I have already paid. When I go to log in for further information they say that my log in and password are not valid even though I had just established one. This is confusing and raises doubts as to their record keeping. I would choose another server, but I still have time on my contract. So I'm stuck and unable to get answers from XFINITY."
"Luis of Kissimmee, FL",42444,1,"I just recently moved to the place I am now and request Comcast service due to the reason this is the cheaper cable company around here. It was the worst decision ever. The cable is literally a basic local channel antenna with no good channels at all. All the cable channels are blocked, the only channels you can see are the same ones you can see with an antenna, and the WiFi is the worst - the signal doesn't even arrive to my bedroom, you need to literally be next to the modem to get a good signal... sometimes. I'm just going to cancel this crap and look for another company."
"kelly of Montgomery, IL",42444,1,"I spoke to a representative with whom was given my contact information. It took her 2 days just to get me a price. When I agreed to the price she said she would call me right back with an installation date. It's 5 days later and no call from her. I was connected with another rep who told me if I paid a $100 deposit on Thursday I would be guaranteed service on Saturday. Since I have 2 children who need internet to do homework I paid the deposit. No call from Comcast by Saturday so I called the rep back, he told me to give him until 11 am that day and he would have a time for me.I called at 11 am, as requested and as of the following Tuesday I still had not heard back from the rep. I had received a call from Comcast that Monday saying someone would be there on Tuesday AM to do install. I had to have someone at my house waiting since I had to work. The tech showed up, stayed about 20 minutes and told the girl waiting that the install could not be done. I then called the rep who guaranteed service by Saturday and he again went back and forth with me, along with his supervisor. I was told by his supervisor that she would call me by 6 pm that same Tuesday and I would have install that night.I never received a call and I had been told they would send me instructions immediately on how to log onto the HotSpot in my area, to which I still have not received information. I went back and forth with several reps with your company and was constantly transferred from person to person, and in many cases right back to the first automated system. It took me until the following Monday to get someone competent on the line who had installation set up for the following day. I was told many times by the 2nd rep who had guaranteed service on that Saturday the because of all the problems I would be credited back the $100 deposit, that the $50 installation fee would be waived and that the $150 installation fee was not going to be due.I still have no credit to my debit card, and I see no installation fees removed from my bill, which was sent to me several days before I even had service. I would not recommend this service to anyone. Worst company I have ever dealt with. There is no excuse for so many incompetent people or being referred back to the beginning of automated system or sent to the wrong department. Not only do I have 2 children who need internet for school work, I run businesses from my home and was forced to use additional data from my cell phone line to make up for Comcast errors."
"Andrea of Houston, TX",42442,1,"Houston has 2 internet providers - AT&T and Comcast. Both are horrendous, unreliable, and have terrible customer support. Being forced to choose one over the other makes question if we're really a democracy. I've wasted sooo much time and money trying to get decent, reliable service that if I was getting paid to wrestle with Comcast, I'd be a millionaire."
"Cassie of Arvada, CO",42442,1,If you have any choice do not use Comcast. The technician who set up our service was not knowledgeable and the company switched our package to a lower one without our knowledge. The service technician also broke our sound bar and Comcast is doing nothing to fix it or replace it. Overall an awful experience and we plan to cancel service asap.
"Adam of Boston, MA",42441,1,"When there was an issue with speed (MBPS), Comcast reps told me to buy their router for 10$ a month. That didn't fix it and I lost the salvage value of my own high-quality router from Best Buy, and am now paying another 10$ a month in addition to those damages incurred to me (and others, so I hear) by Comcast. After this didn't fix the issue, they wouldn't provide recourse and then required that I upgrade for about another 40$ a month to get my service working. These are bait and switch sales practices and are easy regulations. The company can be doing this to many people from the sampling obtained so far, and they will be paying millions. Attorneys, take note. If you don't see this in the news quickly, you better gobble it up for your firms. We're in the process of filing promptly to incentive them to stop doing this to their clients, not to exclude antitrust problems."
"L. P. of Portland , OR",42441,1,"So about 6 months ago last summer a door to door salesman for Comcast basically trapped me outside while doing the yard work and convinced me to switch from DirecTV to Comcast just to try it out. He stated that Comcast no longer has any contracts that they use with new service. He also stated that I would get a $250 (of which I only got $100 gift card) and I only had to stay with the company for 3 months to be able to get the gift card. After the three-month period I was supposed to be able to cancel with no extra cost. However I tried Comcast for about 6 months. I went to try and cancel my Comcast today as I wanted to go back to DirecTV because the service I was getting was horrible. When I cancelled I was then told there was going to be $150 cancellation fee for my contract. I informed the lady on the phone that I did not have a contract, however she stated I approved a contract and there was no way to override it. I argued with her and with her supervisor for about an hour. The supervisor stated that if I would have contacted them after I received the email stating that my services were turned on and at the very bottom I guess it said that it was on a term contract. However because I was told by the agent of Comcast that there was no more contracts I didn't read any further to see if I was in a contract. So now what I'm trying to do is first he told me to go to the store and return my equipment and see if they would help me get my hundred and $150 removed from my account. Or if that didn't work I am supposed to send a snail mail letter to Comcast. Unbelievably Comcast corporate offices do not have phone numbers or email addresses that consumers can contact them with. We are to send a snail mail letter and hope someone calls us back. It's not about the money to me. What I'm upset about is I was lied to and this isn't right. And I wonder how many other people he lied to to get them to sign up for Comcast. And how many of these people don't know yet that they're under a two-year contract that they have no idea they're under. I did tell him that I wanted someone to check into the person who did this to me and that I wanted the company I guess a third party company to contact me and tell me if this is integrity issue. Which I'm guessing it is because it happened to me. It had to happen to someone else from the same guy. I will be going to the store front hopefully next week and I will update you on what happens. I am just so annoyed that an agent of a company can lie to you and not get in trouble for it. The supervisor said I should have read the entire contract before I signed it. I'm sure there are people that do this but most of us trust the person who is signing us up for a service and feel I'm sure that if they lie the company will fix it. And the service by the way was horrendous. I had probably 20 if not more disruptions in service in the six months that I had it than I did in the 15 years that I had DirecTV before that. Also Comcast charges for most of its on demand products. They either say you can rent them or purchase them. Whereas DirecTV has mostly free on demand. You have to pay for some of their movies but most of their TV shows are free. I'm hoping that this will help at least one person not get Comcast. If you want a good company go to DirecTV. Comcast is horrible and I don't know why I even tried it for the three months let alone 6 months that I did. I figure they were a big company and they would be able to fix the problems. Yet they sent out technicians and the problems did not get fixed and now I find out they lied to me. So I will be coming back after I go talk to someone in the store and let you know if I got anything resolved or if I had to write that snail mail letter and then see if someone calls me back. So basically do not under any circumstances sign up for Comcast unless you have a lawyer. Read your contract ahead of time. Or you'll get screwed."

Even when you threaten to leave their company they still don't care. At one point they accidently created 2 accounts for me because one of the reps misspelled my first name on a bill. Instead of fixing the problem, they told me I owed BOTH bills and refused to fix the issue. I ended up canceling their service, and they sent their harassing debt collectors after me for a measly 50 bucks! After threatening to mess with my credit score I ended up just paying the 50.00 that I didn't even owe. Terrible, terrible customer service. I'd recommend anyone but them."
"Nick of Madison Heights, VA",42439,1,1st - I have had to go through this painful process of resetting my password over 6 times when I have never had to do this more than once on any other website. You have to actually have a chat message to solve the problem. I think something is wrong with their website. 2nd - I have over 4 conversations about getting a refund from Comcast for over 7 months which still has been useless. Almost every time I get a new story. 3rd - Comcast hits me every 6 months with a new internet plan that costs more in which I have to call and have them switch. Please avoid this company. I would give -5 stars if possible.
"K of Berwyn, IL",42438,1,"I got Comcast July 2015, it is now March 2016, the service is being spotty. I had issues with service down and I had techs coming to my house 6 time until now. The latest was on Feb 2016. The service was down a Wednesday morning. I called and they sent a tech on Saturday. He found 'no issues', but he said that the connection outside my house was loose. The service was up for a couple of hours after the tech was gone but went down abruptly. I called again and they send somebody next Monday. He checked and declared that there was a faulty splitter inside the house. He replaced it, the service came back on, but he said that the wiring was set up wrong with splitters in wrong place and said that the company would redo it BUT with a fee.A week went by with service (wow!!), but next Saturday morning - what a surprise - the service was down again. FYI: By the term SERVICE I mean everything. TV, internet. I called. As usual I went through the trivial, identification, plug, unplug (stuff that I already done), ping, trying to downgrade the importance of the outage. They scheduled a new tech appointment for the coming Monday. Another day off work for me. The tech this time finds that the problem is at the pole outside my house. A box worn out (he showed to me - I could see it almost in pieces) hanging. He said that the pole techs would come and replace it. And they did. I have service since. The same spotty, down at times but it's there.The story does not end here though. They gave me $20 credit for all those days that I had no service. I was pleasantly surprised. Then I received the email with my upcoming bill. To my (not pleasant) surprise they had added a $70 fee for one of the tech appointments. I called again (March 1, I started keep logs of all communications). 1 more hour of my day. I talk with a CS rep and after a long conversation and explanations that the issue was on their end (Comcast) he assure me that he would submit an escalation ticket (#CR565104731) to his supervisor to waive the charge. I thanked him and waited for the confirmation.When it came I realized that they only waived half the amount. Called again (March 4 - my birthday). Rep named Daphne told me that this was the company policy and she would not waive the rest of the charge. I was trying to explain that the issue was not in my end but outside the house at the pole, but she said it did not matter. I should pay. If I did not want to pay in the future I should buy a protection plan. Protection from whom? The same company that I pay for my service, apparently. She also tried to get rid of me stating that the issue has been resolved. Again and again.I demanded for a supervisor and refused to hang up. I also stated that I was the customer with the issue and I knew that it was not resolved as she wanted me to admit. Stayed on the phone for more than 1 (one) hour asking for a supervisor, while she was saying that there is no one available. (Me being in the same business - IT - I knew that this is impossible.) After approx 1 (one) hour she brought on the phone somebody (name Avis) as a supervisor. I doubt that she was one. She tried to get rid of me the same way. I again did not give up and demanded a supervisor (of the supervisor).Finally a supervisor (name Jon) came up after having me waiting (and listening to their misleading commercials) for 15' and he told me that he would waive the rest of the fee FOR THIS TIME ONLY. I have the email with the confirmation. I am waiting for the actual bill to see it happening. Stay tuned. The moral of the whole thing is that Comcast customers need to buy protection plan to protect themselves from Comcast. If not they will be charged for Comcast issues. When there is no competition for a business anything can happen. I have never in my life been treated like that from a company. Much more from a huge one like Comcast. In any case this is life. As my ancient ancestor Socrates used to say 'I get old while I learn'. Thanks for your attention, be careful who you are dealing with and do not give up. If we all raise our voice these things will not happen."
"cheryl of Burleson, TX",42437,1,"Had Comcast out Fri. They rewired the line outside. Monday the line falls down over my driveway, laying on roof garage, and laying across 3-4 lines coming into, and out of my house. I call Comcast, they say they won't be able to come fix it until Thurs. This could be a fire hazard, and I told customer service this. Said they would call me tomorrow to discuss this. Well it's tomorrow, and I still haven't heard a word from Comcast."
"Davina of Indianapolis, IN",42436,1,"I dumped Comcast for AT&T U-verse a few years ago, and they almost lured me back with one of their promotional packages. I signed up online and they gave me the option of a self-install kit, but after I took that option I realized that the cable was going to need some attention and I needed a technician. So I contacted them, they sent me a confirmation e-mail for the installation date, and even gave me a confirmation phone call for the date.The day of the install arrives and I heard nothing from them within an hour of the installation window, so I checked the status of the appointment online - and it said there was no appointment scheduled. I called them and they confirmed the same. Irritated as hell, I told them to just cancel the account; the customer service representative told me ""It's already been cancelled"". I was so angry I just hung up before I bothered to ask who authorized terminating the account because it certainly wasn't me!The savings were tempting enough for me to consider giving them another chance, but my previous experience with getting service installed and working should have kept me from considering them on any level ever again. My first round with them included two service calls they didn't bother showing up for - without telling me they'd cancelled them - because the field techs pinged the cable and decided there was nothing wrong. Twice. Never mind the fact that the issue was a bad modem and that I had no internet or phone service - and was sitting at home waiting for them both times! Stay clear of them, and don't be lured into being their victim with promotional packages. Probably the best thing they could do for me was screw up the install today; otherwise I'd have been stuck with them for 2 years."
"Yaviany of Margate, FL",42436,1,"Comcast has been the worst. Their billing system has tons of errors showing payments are due even after you've made a payment, which resulted in a fiasco of confusion and unnecessary additional payments, stop payments, and issues with customer service. The last customer care rep I spoke with was argumentative, laughed at me when I expressed my frustration and condescending. I wish my community allowed another service provider."
"Tami of Bonita Springs, FL",42435,1,"Unable to obtain any contact either through phone, Facebook, or website to let a customer service rep know that the internet and cable have been out for nearly 13 hours."
"Luther of Adrian, MI",42434,1,"I have only had this service for 6 months and it has been an absolute nightmare since the day I signed up for it. Their customer service is terrible, they bill me for a DVR that I don't have and when I called to talk to someone about it they told me supervisor would call me in an hour after reviewing my issues, but no call. Not surprised about that at all because it's how they do business. I am convinced they only want your money as the bill is the only thing that is consistently on time, they never forget to charge you for service you may or may not have. Xfinity sucks my ** and I'm going back to Dish Network."
"Equilla of Detroit, MI",42434,1,"I have been on the phone with customer service for 1 hr & 20 min. I am now waiting for account verification. This company is a disaster! I don't know how they survive. Because I live in an area where I cannot use AT&T or DirecTV I am forced to deal with this incompetence. I was quoted a promotion rate which I now learned was through a telemarketing firm. Since I had to reschedule my install, I thought I would call and confirm what I had been quoted. (I just don't trust them to do what they say they will do) Just as I expected a foreign speaking rep said she could not find the promotional rate so they had to rework and offer to mirror what I had been promised which was not nearly as good as the promotional rate (mind you I spent 45 min with the telemarketer). I think this is a deliberate bait and switch process because it has happened before with other Comcast situations. I have now been waiting for 3rd party verification another 20 min! Of course when I go through the verification process I was not offered the same as customer service promised! They tried to force me into a contract when I was told there would not be a contract. I have been going through this process for 3 hours and I still do not have a confirmed appointment!! This company is HORRIBLE, PAINFUL and FRUSTRATING! HONESTLY I WOULD RATHER FIND A STRAY BULLET THAN DEAL WITH THIS MADNESS. They could care less about customer service! I pray that technology will continue to advance so that Apple and other streaming vehicles develop technology so that companies like Comcast will be forced out of business and we will not have to deal with such a ** performance anymore!"
"Penny of Baltimore, MD",42433,1,"I needed to call Comcast to speak with someone about my billing, as my husband's business was paying $70.00 less per month for the exact same services. I used to call Comcast and get whatever help or info I needed... Now it is all menu-driven and I had to look to Google for blogging help as to how to get a human being on the line. It took me 1 1/2 hours to find someone who would adjust the billing... The 1st person took over 10 minutes just to find me the Comcast business phone number I needed (because Comcast residential does not have the contact number for Comcast business?) and then she could not transfer me so I started all over again. Now, after that 1 1/2 hour stint, waiting on hold and speaking to 3 people, I am supposed to receive an email contract in order to lower my bill, but I have not received it. This is nonsense. I will have to go through it again. They have no customer service."
"Kathleen of Seattle, WA",42432,1,We met a Comcast representative at a trade show and agreed to meet with him in the afternoon the next day. He was a no show but did call at 5:30 to say that he was unable to make the tentative appointment. Two days later I received a message from Comcast confirming an appointment for the next day. I did not make the appointment so extended to them the courtesy of canceling in. I was placed on hold twice. Spoke to two representatives and explained that I had not made the appointment I was cancelling. Both made me verify my credentials two different ways and asked me to explain why I was canceling the appointment. At 8:20 pm the same night I received another call verifying my appointment. I think I know why our bills are so high -- too much service.
"Neil of Columbia, MD",42432,1,"After many years with Verizon FIOS, I decided to switch over to Comcast because they honestly did offer me more channels for less money than Verizon did. However, it was a terrible mistake. First (this is not actually a big deal, but it does bother me), for some reason Comcast does not offer the same HD movie channels that Verizon does. For the premium channels, only the main channels are offered in HD. This means that HBO is in HD; however HBO2, HBOW, HBO Family, etc are only in SD. Same goes for Showtime, Starz, and all the premium channels. I talked to Comcast about it and he basically tried convincing me that Verizon does not offer those either. I have already switched back to Verizon and I assure you, all the premium channels are offered in HD.Now for my real complaint: After having Comcast for about 3 months, my internet and cable went down one day. I thought ok, no big deal, this happens sometimes. After a day I gave them a call and they sent a technician to come check it out. The technician says the problem is not in our house and there is an issue with the wiring outside in my neighborhood. He said he was not qualified to fix this so said a technician who deals with those issues will come and fix it in a couple hours. So later in the day, I noticed a Comcast truck doing work on my street and assumed they were trying to fix this problem. However, they left eventually without stopping by to check if it worked. It still did not work and now I had no idea what the plan was to fix this. So I called Comcast back. They were like ""Oh that's weird"" and sent a technician again 2 days later (this is my 4th day with no internet or cable).Literally the same exact thing happened. Tech came in the house, said problem was outside. Comcast truck came and left and nothing was solved. Called a third time. Person I spoke with said they promised it would get fixed the next day. They did not show up for another 2 days and the same exact thing happened again. I literally told the workers outside to let me know before they leave so we can check it. Nothing, they just left with nothing solved.Throughout this process, I spoke with several ""Supervisors"" in the customer service as I was getting very angry. One supervisor gave me the number and email of another supervisor that was supposed to help me out. I called this number every day and left a voicemail for about a week and heard no response. I also talked to another supervisor that was going to check on some things and assured me repeatedly that she would call me back later that day at 5 PM to check on things and to help out more. I obviously was skeptical and told her all my concerns because they seemed to never respond or want to help me. She continued to promise that she would call me at 5 and she apologized repeatedly and said she could not control what other agents were doing and was like it won't happen with me.Finally I said ok and anticipated her call. Of course, never got contacted again. After 2.5 weeks of no internet, cable, or any inclination of the problem being solved in the future, I canceled my service and switched back to Verizon. I had always heard rumors about how Comcast customer service is horrible but I never imagined it could be as bad as my experience was."
"spanish of Lauderhill, FL",42432,1,"I move and transfer service. Instead of moving your service Comcast train their staff to lock you in a new contract without you knowing even if you have service for the last 5 years with them. My bill was 2300 from when I move in December 18 until Feb 1. I receive a bill for 2300 that's overprice stealing from customer tricking them that the bill is 150. A month from when I start to 320 for cable I did not even have HBO are and premium channel. What am I been charge for this is a rip-off. Comcast is only want money from customer but lack service. Even the internet speed they turn down very slow, must be for retarded people. Watching your bill Comcast charge overcharge for channel that should be free. They also force you to sign a contract when transfer service without you knowing. They just prey on customers for money and all you get is reruns. If you have to pay for rerun just sign up for Netflix, you get what you pay for. Do not sign up for Comcast because out of 60 channels only 3 or 4 is any good. It's a waste and a shame Comcast steal from their customer. What you pay for you never get. Comcast rob me. "
"ernest of Drexel Hill, PA",42431,1,"I signed up last August for the triple deal and was given over the phone a great price so I switched from Verizon. Big mistake. Not only did it take them 5 times to get it working, they have been back almost every month for something. Do you have the time to be home for them to fix it and not to mention the hours on the phone. I have not paid the same bill twice. It always going up and when I called now they say I have a two year agreement not 12 months. I talked to a guy Michael to account and he had such an attitude. Like what your problem?"
"Dina of Ashland, VA",42431,3,"It's fine. Haven't had to call recently. However when we do, I have to have my husband call because his name is on the bill. BUT I PAY THE BILLS! So it's irritating. The only problem I have with the quality is that when cable goes out, it's usually out longer than Verizon land-line phone service ever is. The cost of cable TV is ridiculously high. The business model is totally for these companies & the networks and not for consumers at all. Networks get paid by advertisers then by cable companies. The cable companies get paid to provide us with the networks. And what does the consumer get? Gouged by cable and advertised to death by the networks. If the networks weren't so greedy, everything would cost less. If I already pay to see a network, I shouldn't have to also see advertising on that network. In other words, I'm paying to be advertised to. I hate it. Why do they have an absolute right to solicit me but I don't have any right to not be solicited? Also, all tv should be HD w/o added costs and no commercials should be included when watching shows on demand. "
"Deborah of Portland, OR",42431,2,Pathetic. They don't know their own product. We pay up the yin yang and yet every time we want to watch a show we don't have it. A lot of channels used to be included in a package but it seems now that all those channels want individual subscriptions. It's a real rip-off. We get nothing basically for a lot of money. If we could ditch it we would but antennas don't work in this area. The internet is slower than time even though we pay top dollar for the top tier. It also just freezes up often throughout the day. Movies stop throughout their viewing saying not enough bandwidth is available. I think Xfinity purposely clamps down on speed and bandwidth. We don't game so it's really unfair. We are in no way hogging the net. Waiting for something better to be available in our area. Reliable? HA! RiDICKulous is more like it. Xfinity is a scam operation and the feds do nothing about it. Criminals.
"H. of Elk Grove, Ca, CA",42431,2,"It usually takes a very long time to get someone on the phone & when we do get someone...they don't speak English and don't understand the problem. The problem is usually not resolved until a day or two later after the ""cable box"" or ""internet modem"" has been ""reset"" several times after several calls back. T.V. is usually fine. Internet speeds are variable and often very slow. Also, the cable provider opted us ""in"" to providing a free hotspot for the general public (at least for other XFINITY subscribers). That made our internet crawl! The installation process was very easy for cable. We tried to also have the phone installed, but it was too difficult so we had to stop that subscription. The internet was a self-setup. Each of our services goes down without warning at various times during the day in all kinds of weather. We're never given an explanation or a credit, even though it happens all the time. "
"Denise of Chgo, IL",42431,2,"They present well but deliver poorly. My DVR died. Called support, determined a replacement was needed, and it was to be mailed to me. Received replacement, replacement did not work. Called again, they told me they would send a repairman out & would CHARGE ME! I cancelled service. Had to return equipment to a local store of theirs. Waited in their store with over 200 people & 1 service person working behind thick plexiglass. One person working!! Waited close to 2 hrs before my number was called. Poor. The costs are too high, their equipment is old, software interface is poor. Service (getting a picture/programs) was reliable, the equipment was not. Quit taking advantage of your subscribers by delivering outdated software, hardware, poor customer service and equipment."
"Karen of Aiken, SC",42431,1,"For 10 years I have paid bills online. Now I am locked out of my account and the Comcast/XFINITY office and customer support is also locked out. And why? Because I do not use the assigned email address for comcast.net. No complaints with the quality of the cable or the internet just the company and their underhanded ways. Every year the cost doubles and you have to go to the retention department to find an affordable ""package"" even if you don't want a ""package"". Few instances of downtime in the 10 or 15 years. To force someone to use another email address is ridiculous, and to refuse online service because a customer does not want yet another email address that terminates with the cable service is unethical."
"Donn of Sugar Land, TX",42431,2,"Deceptive, bait and switch... always want an add-on. I only want internet and basic cable. Usually good reception, but get unexpected downtime on internet at strange hours. Far overpriced for the internet services. For shows, when you are retired, you only watch news. Do not like to pay for all the other garbage channels even on basic. Get better reception on digital antenna for local news. At least, it does not fade out when it rains. They force you to rent their boxes monthly for reception in other rooms. This adds up on the bill. The average retired household only watches one or two news channels, Fox and local news. Women will like the Hallmark channel."
"Donwana of Franklin, TN",42431,1,"Endless hold time, outright lying - it's never their problem. If you want a case study of what NOT to do, look at Xfinity. But since they bought up all the other providers, they have a legal monopoly - would LOVE to cut their cord but need internet access. They hold you over a barrel, insanely high fees, endless surcharges, bad service. They regularly throttle down the service, then deny it. I have the logs from my benchmarking - at least 4 times a week they throttle back. Piss poor. They rape the user. Down at least 3 times a week - then they deny it. Wish to hell Cox operated here."
"Jonathan of Seattle, WA",42431,2,"In a word, lousy. Even when we signed up, they would not give us the cable box we ordered (with dvr) and told us it was their policy to just give what is on hand. The services offered, I don't have much of a problems with, save the price for what we get. Far too expensive a service. Higher speeds is an even higher premium. They should offer outstanding customer service at an affordable price, the kind of service one gets when one isn't served by a monopoly."
"Debra of Harrisburg, PA",42431,2,"No cost effective options to lower cable prices, less channels. Who really watches the golf station?? Cant' fast forward on most on-demand shows...too many commercials. Too many stupid channels. I can't speak Spanish, I don't watch Golf channel (why is there more than one??), excessive sports channels, awful choices... no PBS on demand. Why can't I choose my own stations that actually suit my household? Why can't I drop my landline to save money??"
"Art W. of Scranton, PA",42431,3,"For answers, they read off of a computer screen and have no idea what they are saying. X1 box is very slow. Cable and internet is way too expensive for what they provide. DVR doesn't work at times, can't delete programs. I hate Comcast, Xfinity, whatever they call themselves. Rates are constantly going up for no reason, programming sucks, DVR should be a lot faster than it is. Even Comcast says that it is VERY slow!!!"
"Ken of Plymouth, MN",42431,2,"Xfinity's X1 DVR system has a serious flaw in that it tends to cut off the ends of programs. I had DirecTV for 3 years prior to switching back to Comcast for cost reasons. DirecTV's system records a couple of minutes beyond the scheduled end of a program thus not risking the loss of the end of the program content. I'm not referring to upcoming episodes of the program at the end of the show, but actual missing current program content. Although I would like to see the previews for the next episode also, which is lost. The X1 system also contains less information than the DirecTV system in their guide. For instance they don't list the guests on a talk show. You have to take extra steps to find it if it exists."
"satish of Chattanooga, TN","Feb. 29, 2016",1,Not at all happy with the service I am getting. Raised a complaint but never received any response from them. Over the call they told there is no service fee but when I get the bill I see service fee addedŠ—_ Just disgusting.
"Arecia of Jacksonville, FL","Feb. 28, 2016",1,"I started a business contract with Comcast back in December of 2015. When I started the contract I was informed that my home phone, internet and cable will become one bundle that would give me one bill versus me having to 2 bills. Who in their right mind wants to have to cable bill, both of them are $106 and $0.13 a month. They are highway robbery. They tell you one thing and do another. When I asked for a bundle deal I ask for a bundle. The bottle of that I was told that I will ask you receive is the cable internet and phone for 3 years for $94. My total bill for the whole three years of $106.13 plus the taxes. That's not what's really happening so today I had to experience me having no service because of their mishaps."
"Alexis of Nashville, TN","Feb. 26, 2016",1,"I recently relocated and set up internet and cable through Comcast/Xfinity. I had no issues getting my account established over the phone. I went to the Xfinity store to pick up my equipment in order to do a self-installation of my services. I own an internet router/modem and took it with me to the store (in the original box) to see if it would be compatible with the Comcast/Xfinity internet. The rep at the store was friendly and personable and said he ""added the router/modem"" to the list of compatible routers and that I shouldn't have any issues.Once I got home, I got everything connected and called the self-install number. I was on the phone for almost an hour and they could not get my router to pick up a signal. I eventually was transferred to a technician and after talking with him for 20 minutes, he said I needed to go get another router. I was incredibly frustrated at this point, as the guy at the store said that I should have no issues getting it to connect. I drove back to the store (a 30-minute drive) to rent a router. They did not compensate me at all for the inconvenience.When I called back to try to activate my services again, I ended up being on the phone for another HOUR. The woman did not know how to troubleshoot why my internet was not connecting and ended up having to transfer me to another technician. After the internet was connected, I then had to be transferred back to someone to help me activate my cable. I told him that I had connected my tv box to the TV with an HDMI cord and he said that HD was not included in my package!! I told him that I explained to the lady who set up my account that I had an HD tv. He said he would not charge me for the HD activation (thank goodness)!After getting off the phone with them, I realized they did not help me set up my DVR. I called back and another lady told me that someone had deleted the DVR off my account and that the tv box they had given me was not equipped with the DVR feature and that in order to have that set up, I would have to take my current box back to the store and pick up a new one and then go through activation again. I told them to forget it due to the inconveniences I had had throughout the day. Once turning my TV on, I realized the channels are SO limited and even some of the major/common channels are not included. For close to $80 a month, I feel like I should be getting more for my money. I am glad Comcast/Xfinity doesn't have contract associated with it because I was very disappointed in their customer service, the package that I bought and the disorganization across the board. I would NOT recommend this company."
"Ana of Medley, FL","Feb. 25, 2016",1,"We changed from a different provider to Comcast with the conditions that they were going to provide the similar features that make our company run smoothly. They promised everything, as well as a smooth transition for installation (we are in the middle of moving to a new location once the construction is finalized). However, since our move in Oct, we have had problems with our fax line (which I finally narrowed it down to pinpointing that the Comcast lines are digital, even though they say it's analog). It's a digital line that ""technically has the same features as an analog line"" (I have sporadic service where I cannot count on faxing, so I have changed to emailing everything).I have also been having problems with the internet, where we are constantly being kicked out of the programs that run online (OUTLOOK, something so basic that we rely on: emails). When the program is offline, I keep receiving pop-up messages in regards to enter my passwords, etc. because I keep being kicked out the programs. FINALLY BUT DEF not the LEAST, my phones have the worst service. Calls come in, we answer and no one can hear us, or other callers receive messages that our phones are disconnected, or they just cannot get through for whatever reason.HOW ARE WE SUPPOSE to run a business and provide the service when our lines for communication: OUR PHONES, FAX AND EMAILS have such unreliable service?? This has been the worst experience I've had to deal with trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are fixing the problem. NOW, they come around to tell me that other customers that have experienced the same issue has been resolved by upgrading to a different VOIP system. FIRST, I need to point out that I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE undergoing this situation. SECOND, I'm pretty much being bullied into changing the way my business works and runs so that I can keep them as providers... Why do they have it all backwards?? They are supposed to mold to our needs, and here I am being told that I need to change my phone systems, and pay more than I am doing so now so that I can make these problems go away.I am at breaking point where I'm researching to contact HELP ME HOWARD because their method of doing business is completely backwards. I keep getting the run around. Oh and I forgot to mention, in regards to the new location we are suppose to move to, we have been having to postpone the new installation due to delay with the construction. I keep receiving phone calls to notify that the installation is scheduled TOMORROW!! I've gone over this several times with our ""customer rep"" that is our direct contact through this process and it's still not getting cleared in the system. I feel like I would have to hire someone JUST to deal with Comcast because it's too time consuming to keep having to go over the same information again and again, as you would with children in a pre-k classroom. This is ridiculous."
"Jake of Sacramento, CA","Feb. 25, 2016",1,"My father worked for this company since I was a baby. For a long time I loved comcast. But now, I've realized I've only loved it because my dad worked there and we got so much for so cheap. My dad got hurt and was let go. Now that I see how much you have to pay to get any kind of ""good"" service, it's ridiculous. We pay almost a hundred dollars a month and we have to constantly get new remotes because we can't get our on demand without it. We have to pay more to watch what we already pay for? Also I didn't realize, but you also took the buttons off the box so we are FORCED to buy new remotes! Your service for employees are amazing, but for everyday people, your service sucks. I will never be a consumer again even if you give me a lifetime of free best awesome cable. Rot in a fruit cake six months after Christmas Xfinity. ROT."

Two hours later (after an hour on hold), Comcast was unaware of the problem or able to see which Supervisor would be contacting us. They told us we would be contacted within 24 hrs. We explained that we needed immediate internet for our businesses, there was no sympathy for this.After waiting 24 hours, we called back. There were no notes in the system. The operator said that the nearest appt. for an installation was on March 1 (a week out). I told her that we could not wait that long and needed a response immediately. She said to give the Supervisor 48 hours to call us. I asked for his name and number, she said that she wasn't sure who would be contacting us - it wasn't assigned. I requested the $90 installation fee and days without service be waived/reimbursed. She said I would have to call back and petition after the services were fully installed."
"Pene of Las Vegas, NV","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"The field technician was great. However it took 4 calls to house techs who knew nothing before they sent someone out. Since faulty equipment was fixed, signal has been good most of the time. Only one outage which was nationwide. Install easy, programming not as good as DirecTV. Comcast needs to work on their guide. There should be a way to only view subscribed channels."
"Beverly of Chesterfield, VA","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"Had issue getting voice mail but customer service was very supportive helping. Service has been good so far. There is nothing on tv anymore, all the channels are the same. What is on are repeats. Pay such high price for nothing. Lately having to reboot cable boxes a lot. Need to provide service at more affordable rates. All the channels and really only use 10 channels but have to pay for level up because they don't carry on the affordable plan."
"John of Berkeley, CA","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"They're generally curious, knowledgeable, and predictable. After some initial glitches with the X-1 system, TV service is generally fine. Internet will experience random drops throughout the day, every day. Anywhere between a few seconds and half an hour. Way too expensive for the few TV channels we watch, with way too little content in between commercials. After initial glitches it's pretty much okay. We love the on demand functionality."
"Yvonne of Mt. Juliet, TN","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"It's so difficult to reach them. I usually had to 'chat' over my computer and then it's just not personal. Since I could save the transcript to prove what the agent actually said to me, that was the only positive I can offer. Entirely too expensive. Too many outages - I went for almost two weeks without cable once and they never even offered to deduct anything from my bill for not having service. "
"Gordon of Mays Landing, NJ","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"They act like they are doing you a favor by allowing you to talk to them. Had numerous problems from bad wiring, to Comcast technicians cutting the wrong wires, to network outages. If I could rate less than 1, I would. Prices too high, services very unreliable, and customer service is the worst. I was finally able to get Verizon FIOS and it is 1000 times, maybe more, better than Comcast."
"Veronica of Kirkland, WA","Feb. 24, 2016",2,I hate calling Comcast. Automated menus doesn't let you just choose customer service. Foreigners answering your calls. You can hardly understand them. Cable/internet will go out or put codes up. The cost is ridiculous. Supposedly you're saving with triple play but I don't see any savings and the taxes they pass on are infuriating. Reliable for the most part but will go out for unforeseen reasons. 
"Robert of Birmingham, AL","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"I was able to negotiate a lower rate subsequent to an unexpected, ridiculous price increase. Internet speed is exceptional, but the value of TV service is pitiful. I have had half a dozen cable providers over the years, and Comcast is the worst value of all - offering fewer channels and no free HD for the highest cost. No problems. Comcast is good for Internet speed, but horrible for TV service value."
"Leigh of Portland, OR","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"Comcast knows that it is not a consumers' market, as they now have a near monopoly in our area and can raise fees and basically charge whatever they want. Their customer service is hit or miss. The last time we called with an issue regarding our router not working properly, they did send a replacement router, but then increased our monthly bill. This is after stating very plainly that the new modem/router was not going to increase our monthly bills. Add to that, very long hold times, out of state support operators, and general impression of not really caring about customer experience as long as they get paid. Comcast needs to be broken up and definitely not be allowed to merge with Time Warner. Internet access should be equal to all citizens, not based on ability to pay a very high premium fee."
"Bembenek of Greenacres, WA","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"I've have Comcast cable services for about 15 years. I am currently living on a fixed income. When I call the agents from Comcast about lowering my fees to them I get different responses to lowering my bill. It seems like Comcast treats new customers like gold and its longtime customers like something else. Some of my friends that are longtime subscribers of Comcast have had to end their services with Comcast because their Comcast bill went through the roof. I wish they had more specials for their longtime subscriber that equalled their specials that they give to new time subscribers. Sometimes the internet connection gets really slow. I rely on Comcast for my internet, phone and TV connections. I've only had sporadic outages with Comcast. With Comcast it seems like the bottom end is the dollar and not customer service."
"Jeanette of Atlanta, GA","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"TV goes out, cannot get Comcast to respond in a timely manner. Rates keep going up while customer support has dropped off. Not enough staff to answer phones because when I call it takes longer for someone to answer. And when they do answer they are trying to sell some other service. My picture goes out, I call Comcast. They say they're working on it. I call back and I am put on hold for ten minutes or more. Or if they answer quickly they are trying to sell me. Much too expensive. And my building is sold out to Comcast so I cannot go to another source to even try to get a better deal. The most reliable thing is getting billed every month and the bill goes up. They should have a resource for the elderly. Some advocate to appeal the process they take senior citizens through."
"P. of Wilmington, DE","Feb. 24, 2016",1,You can't talk to a human initially. I usually do a chat online. It depends on what employee you get. They are very good at apologizing. Equipment is cheap. Two remotes went out the same day. One box doesn't work. I have to take my time to return. Comcast sucks. They don't care because there is little competition. Writing to the executive office is also a joke. We have to live up to our side of the contract and they don't. Service goes out too much. Equipment is cheap and unreliable. When I initially decided to go to Comcast and went through Sales they lied about price and gave me service I never asked for. It took months to get the service removed. Trying to get out but have a 2 year contract. I have to abide by contract but they don't. How fair is that!
"Etta of Guilford, IN","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"What customer support? A problem... be prepared to be transferred at least 3-4 times and still most likely not have the issue resolved. They also lie about the bundling package prices. The X1 upgrade.. we were told we MAY get up to 75 mbps. We already had 25 mbps which they said could be average. What kind of ""upgrade"" is that? Then they give you a price, but when you receive the email confirmation, it's not at all what was discussed. Extremely deceptive tactics to lock you in for 2 years at really no discount. The internet goes out all the time. Pay more for less... That's their motto. The popular packages are removed from lower packages and put in higher ones to get you to pay them even more to get the channels you regularly watch. Mediocre. "
"Marcelia of Jacksonville, FL","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"Inexperienced with the products and services Comcast/Xfinity provides. Comcast has the worst customer service ever! They over charged and tell the customers one price and charge another. The services doesn't work half of the time. The internet disconnects all of a sudden. The TV shows blink out and freezes daily. It is horrible, not worth what we pay for it literally!! Not reliable at all. Comcast does not value good honest and on-time paying customers! I made several complaints about Comcast aka Xfinity whom have changed their name but not their products/services and customer service to the Company as well as the Better Business Bureau. I would not promote Comcast to anyone. I nothing positive to say about my Cable company. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!"
"d of Acworth, Georgia","Feb. 24, 2016",4,"It breaks, they try to fix it. Not including outages. They're not proactive in terms of notifying of outages. You just have to guess that it's not working, perhaps it's a larger problem. Good programs, but the pay channels all have the same programs and run repeatedly the same movies or shows. Nothing much new in the way of new programs. Entertainment value. Price for the service doesn't equal the quality of the product. Pricing/packages are terrible in that new customers get better pricing whereas long-standing existing customers get nothing in the way of a price break. A take it or leave it mindset!! Consistent in the availability area. OVERPRICED PRODUCTS/SERVICES. UNDER-APPRECIATED LOYALTY OF THE LONG-STANDING CUSTOMERS."
"Joe of Clarks Summit, PA","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"Customer services is OK. Tech support - depends on who you get on the phone. Most of the time it is someone who can only read from a script. We pay for channels we never watch - need a la carte. Internet is very reliable, but Xfinity X1 not ready for prime time. Many system hangups, lost recordings, software hangups requiring almost daily reboots of the X1 box, X1 box noisy, aspect ratios inconsistent between HD and non-HD channels, recording often cut off near the end and finally the daily forced reboot at night is obtrusive and shows how crappy the Xfinity software is."
"Craig of Hampstead, MD","Feb. 24, 2016",1,Comcast customer support is programmed robot that has no concept of customer satisfaction. Comcast is all about Comcast. I have had 2 major conflicts with Comcast brought on by technician incompetence that resulted in serious physical damage. Comcast handled both situations poorly. One was a failure to ground the cable which resulted in substantial property loss from a lightning strike. The other was a severed main trunk caused by a Comcast lineman resulting in long outages and replacement of our incoming cable. Comcast Cable is OK. Not 5-star for certain. Too expensive. Poor customer service. Average equipment. Numerous interruptions. Equipment does not function well. I wish there was competition.
"Terry of Jacksonville, FL","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"Most of the people I talked to read what they responded with out of a book. Most of them all told me the same thing. I had trouble understanding about 75% of them due to accent. I figured out what was wrong myself after hours talking to them. Cable picture is great when it is working. 98% of the time it is working fine, but the other 2% It digitally breaks up and stops. They usually say someone is working in the area. Cable costs too much for what you get. I really feel like I'm paying for commercials and not the programs. As most programs are adding more commercials. On demand is good as long as there aren't too many users on it. I would say it is about average with the other services, like dish and phone."
"Kathy of San Francisco, CA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"We found the need to communicate often and when we do, we find Customer service knows very little about their products. It is ironic that the service people confirm they feel the same way. We get odd sync problems with the sound and picture and sometimes the sound doesn't work at all. We have 2 residences and currently pay $163 & $189 respectively. Way too much money for the service and product we receive. Internet is slow (we upgraded to faster at one house and we still can't stream little videos online). OK. At the price we pay I hate to pay retail for HBO & Showtime. My husband calls whenever the deal they give us expires and complains and they generally re-up the deal. Not always."
"Barry of Otis Orchards, WA","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"You can usually get someone on the phone within 5 mins as long as there's not a major issue, in which case they usually have a recording letting you know about it. They tend to want to charge you for everything, but you can talk to a supervisor in many cases and get all or part of the charges removed. We are told we get 50MBPS down speed. That is simply not the case, or I could download a 500MB file in 10 seconds. It normally takes about 1-2 minutes, depending on the time of day. It would make me feel much more warm and fuzzy about Comcast if they actually delivered what they say they deliver download and upload speed-wise, but it's better than C. America!"
"Paul of Saugus, MA","Feb. 24, 2016",4,I haven't needed a lot of support. My most recent call was to confirm that I had the latest cable box. The person I spoke to was very pleasant and helpful. I have had very few outages and the system has always been restored in a reasonably quick manner. I am on the 2nd year of a new contract so I get a lot of channels for a reasonable price. When this year is up I will reduce my cable services to maintain a price close to my current price. No problems with reliability. There are services I currently have but I don't use like DVR and many channels I don't watch. If I was paying retail for these services my cable bill would be much higher.
"Michael of Kingsville, MD","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"When equipment malfunctions (frequently) you have to either drive miles to the one service office, and wait usually over a half hour in line to exchange it, or pay for someone to bring a replacement to your house. Almost impossible to contact a live service person on phone. Both difficult and expensive to deal with when problems arise that they should correct to maintain service. Much too expensive, but the alternative is ""rabbit ears"" in my suburban neighborhood. Frequent partial outages of some channels, freezing programs, and deteriorating signals. My recommendation - avoid if at all possible."
"Dianna of Fremont, CA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"Horrible customer service. Most are not educated with their product, are not able to listen, become defensive, offer a service that I have to pay additional fee, give inconsistent answers, avoid offering anything that could help me save money. Often are fuzzy pictures. Offer packages that I do not want. EXPENSIVE. Since they own this region, they charge what they want. And, sneak charges into my bill. Don't know if I'll have a telephone in the morning...or, my internet maybe down for some unknown reason. Offer individual channels. Is the triple rewards program really saving money? My bill seems to increase every other month."
"Carol of Mobile, AL","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"Customer support is terrible. Appointments are difficult to schedule. Customer Support personnel will promise you services that the repair person hasn't heard of or be notified of. It usually works pretty well but the internet seems to disconnect/connect at all times. The value is very poor. Bill is way too high. When it works, it works well. But too often the tv freezes up, or the guide has wrong shows listed. Although I complain about Comcast, compared to other cable services I have talked about with friends and co-workers, it seems to be the best offered in my area."
"c of Greenbrae, California","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"It takes a while to get someone on the phone but usually they're relatively effective at resolving issues, except the once a week when their Internet service is down. The quality of services is OK but not great. As with virtually everything else, the pricing is a little steep for what you get. Almost once a week either the Internet or telephone service gets interrupted. The speeds and connectivity vary at times. It's an overpriced monopoly that needs to be better regulated or broken up. You pay too much for too little and weekly interruptions get frustrating after a while."
"Cindy of Branford, CT","Feb. 24, 2016",4,"I wasn't getting Starz on my TV, so I notified Comcast about my issue. Person came out to my house and fixed the problem by calling in to Comcast technician. I have no problem with customer service, with amount of TV channels or the quality of the shows I watch. The value of my cable service could be better. Why pay for 100s of channels when I only use about 20 of them? I have never had a drastic problem with receiving cable service. Only when there has been really bad weather do I have interrupted service. "
"Constance of Baltimore, MD","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"I was constantly call customer support how always made promises to correct my bill and it would only be for 1 month and the bill would go back up or never be credited. So I canceled Comcast, purchased a box and watch Netflix's, I'm so much happier and I no longer have that overpriced bill. I was always calling in to have my cable box reset. It was time-consuming and a waste of my time. It worked when it wanted to and when it didn't want to, it didn't. We needed more competition in paid tv so that it is affordable for all."
"Bruce of Nashville, TN","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"Different answers from different employees on same question; poor quality phone connections to cust service (that VOIP system that is delayed so badly); increasing prices and adding services w/o my approval. Poorly trained employees, one of them actually complained to me about his low wages paid by Comcast. Fairly satisfied w/ the internet service, although it NEVER is as fast as they advertise it is. Also recent price increases have it real expensive at $85 month for just internet. Works most of the time. I can't wait for google fiber."
"M. of Anyplace, NH","Feb. 24, 2016",3,Most trouble calls are from non-technical people following a script card. The end of the call is always followed up with a sales pitch. Internet speed is slow during the evenings. Selection of programming for the package I have is terrible. But I'm all set with spending any more than I have to. Every 6 months the price goes up $3-5 for the same terrible service. At least 1 local outage per month. Cable certainly isn't what it once was. Give me MediaOne or AT&T Broadband of yesteryear. Comcast is the worst.
"Steven of Bethesda, MD","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"Quality is erratic, and the internet is often down. Technicians keep coming out and temporarily fix the problem. Poor service. Technicians come out regularly to fix issues. One technician told us that Comcast had installed indoor cable outside the house. Although the service is erratic, the price is 205 less than Verizon. 80% of the time there is no problem. But at once a week, the internet connection is poor and we must call Comcast or reboot the modem. Stay away from this provider if you can."
"Philip of Oakland, CA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"The only thing on my credit report is from Comcast claim that I never returned a $500 cable box when I cancelled service. It's the worst company in any of the countries that I've lived in. I wouldn't open an account with them if they paid me to do so. Technically, the TV signals were OK. The internet was very slow even when I paid for premium ""fast"" service. Hugely overpriced. I only wanted one channel that they carried and the minimum I'd have to pay was over $80 per month."
"Joseph of Huntsville, Alabama","Feb. 24, 2016",4,"Always solves the problem so I have, to date, no complaints. Most of the time the service is very good with sporadic instances of incorrect programming. Love the service. Most of the time the service is very good and occasionally have to call technical support to cover programming issues. Have complained to Comcast in the past that several times after ordering PPV the station was not programmed as promised. Requested that they improve their service in this regard."
"Lacey of Tacoma, WA","Feb. 24, 2016",3,They have to read from the script to be able to accomplish simple tasks or requests vs doing what needs to be done. We have no other choice of cable. We rarely have any service interruptions or issues with the quality of the product. The prices fluctuate often but continue to rise without incentive to stay with the company until you cancel. We have yet to get any service issues. If there were alternative providers in our area we probably would not be with Comcast.
"Paul of Bothell, Other","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"They have been quite responsive to my inquiries and the process is usually fast. It is fairly reliable almost all the time. Too much crap is being offered under the disguise of quality programming! We only watch 10 channels at best and the rest is streamed online. I am fairly certain that when I sit down to watch a cable program, I will be successful. Offer a la carte pricing rather than different levels of tens or hundreds of channels we will never watch."
"Linda of Kissimmee, FL","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"When I call, most times I get someone overseas. That is seriously disturbing. They are very hard to understand and there are too many Americans who need jobs. Great internet service when it works... Very good value. Easy to order on demand as well as changing your services. It seems to be getting better lately. The cost goes up and up till I have to call and ask them to bring the cost down or I will change providers. I Do like that there is no contract."
"Caroline of Chester, Pennsylvania","Feb. 24, 2016",3,Very nasty customer service reps. Clear channels. Nothing wrong with service just billing. Very expensive. You get overbilled. Not for anyone on a fixed income. Pretty reliable. Could be better. Comcast does not consider that some of their customers are seniors on a fixed income and do not get paid when their bill is due. They should take this into consideration and change the billing date to accommodate the pay schedule of the customer.
"joe of Jackson, MI","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"We have BASIC cable, reduced quality & programs. We live with it. We added internet last spring. Comcast adv $15/mo, said we could get $20/mo only, but charge us $25/mo, LIARS. Once upon a time cable was good quality. Now they GREATLY reduced the quality as well # of channels. Being on wrong side of a hill, we need it to get CBS and digital signals are NOT as good as old analog. In a word OK, barely tolerable. We now pay MORE $$ and get less programming & low quality after adding the BOX, just to get BASIC TV, a SCAM. Service signal reliable, Comcast LIE and try to scam us over and over. BEWARE, we have our own PERSONAL cable modem, works fine. Comcast is threatening to LOWER our service and CHARGE us for our cable modem if we do not ship it to Comcast in exchange for THEIR modem & pay monthly rental fees. WHY would I trade a working personal modem we OWN & give It to CommieCast? SCAM!"
"John of Confused, Dazed","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"Wait times on the phone, the transferring from one CSR to another is maddening. They are not empowered to do anything until you work your way through 3-4 levels and even then they are doing you a favor. When I moved the only way to not have my rates skyrocket was to upgrade to the Xfinity platform. When I was just on digital a mile away, Service was uninterrupted. With Xfinity, there are outages, there are several times a month you cannot change channels since ""there is a problem with your service, try again later"". I moved my modem to a more convenient location to reboot. I see no advantage of staying with them other than internet service. Where I am located no one has a competitive rate of speed that will handle my current needs much less if I cut the cord and want to stream everything. For what the service costs it is not up 100%. I know this is petty, but only seems to go out when it is the most critical. If they could offer a more competitive rate and not be so hard to deal with, they would be fine. They simply do not care for their customers only that the payments are there. I had my credit card hacked so I called 2 days before my auto bill and tried to pay the bill with another card so it would not be late. They wanted to charge a service fee for paying over the phone. If I change it on the website they have up to 2 billing cycles to recognize the change. WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? After 15 minutes, they finally agreed this one time to waive that charge... with a credit on the following billing cycle. Had the Exact same issue with my cell phone tied to that card, AT&T offered immediately that all charges would be waived since I contacted them."
"Andrea of San Francisco, CA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"Kept cutting my service back and raising my rates. Then wanted to force me to rent their converter boxes to accommodate their change in service (which btw was not true for months). And I didn't ask for. Finally I just had snow, even though they told me I would not. So I told them to shut me off. 5 times. Despite this they kept charging me. And each time I called they acted as if I had never called/written to turn off my service. So finally I wrote a letter to the office of the CEO. I had read that Comcast takes customer service seriously. HAH. Some guy from the ""office of the president"" called me. At first he was pleasant. When he realized that I really had no interest in staying with Comcast, he became verbally abusive. Even though I told him I was driving, he asked for specific dates that I had called etc. He threatened to send me to collections, even though I had snow on my screen for 5 months, and they had continued to charge my credit card, until I removed it from the website. Bullies, abusers and crappy service. Never again. I had no service and they kept charging me. When I removed my CC number from my account they threatened to send me to collections for not paying for no service which I had called repeatedly to shut down. Criminal. Clueless is how I would describe Comcast, in their best moments. These people are criminal. The worst of monopolies. Totally lacking in anything that resembles integrity."
"June of Spokane, WA","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"Sucks. It's a sales ""upsell opportunity"". Quality of service means I have internet, uninterrupted, and it's fast enough to support our home. I have it. Not what I would envision, but good enough that homework gets done, gamers don't complain, and I can get my work done. I pay in the neighborhood of $83.00 per month for internet only. I cut the TV bundle 2 years ago. I'm being punished for it, but will never take tv again. I don't want the content, 24/7 news propaganda, commercials, and PC promoted lifestyle impacting our family. When too many neighbors stream ""Netflix"" at the same time we lose service via ""buffering"". Fed up. This commodity has become similar to electricity. If not provided, we need a company that can. Reliably, cheaply, and without messy complicated ""deals"". I want internet. I don't want their TV, Phone, or ANYTHING ELSE. Time, we're in ""buffering mode"". When power is down, we lose internet and this idiot company doesn't monitor and reimburse us for down time. The burden is on me to complain. I don't have the time. Fed up and I'm all for Comcast to lose their monopoly. I'm sick of their control over the fiber-optic ""superhighway"". Time for a sell-out, or government takeover via eminent domain. Internet service has become similar to water, sewer, gas, and electricity. Treating it as a luxury option doesn't work anymore. I will support a socialist-style offer from my city when it becomes available."
"Carol of Tallahassee, FL","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"Until VERY recently, technicians would lie to you about what service is available, promise items would be deducted from your bill (only to be re-placed on your bill the next month). Now, however, they are MUCH more pleasant, all the way up to average. Pixelation, almost daily; 5-6 outages a year, down from 10-12. Tallahassee, Florida has the highest Comcast bill in the state, for basic Xfinity service. Xfinity would not work with my new TV (an LG), so I had to use a DTA, instead of a set top box, and I am still using that. That prompted Comcast to bill me for BOTH a set top box and a DTA, and I have tried unsuccessfully for six, yes 6, years to get them to stop doing that, until recently. A technician had to come to my house, and I took the opportunity to walk him around my house so he could see for himself how many cable outlets I have and how many TVs I have. That technician SAYS he fixed my problem, and I will no longer be billed for ""an additional outlet."" We'll see. This is the fifth time someone has promised me that that ** additional outlet would be removed! Oh, they remove it all right, then re-place it on my bill the following month. The ""Comcast guarantee"": don't bother phoning them about it; you're not going to get through on the phone (after an outage). It will be busy until midnight, when that little guarantee will no longer be available because your incident happened ""yesterday."""
"SUSAN of Santa Cruz , CA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"They try to upsell at all costs. They talk in circles; never get a straight answer. Even their retention dept... After I was customer like 15 plus yrs only wanted to give me the fake 2 yrs ""deal"" that after the 2 yrs went to normal prices that I cannot afford. They lie. Told me I had a deal and it changed. ""No. You never had a 15 yr old deal"" lol. They actually made me cry. They would not let me cancel!! Look online. It is true. People have to say they died! Or just move and not give new address. They a passive aggressive. And aggressive period. Mean. It is a cult! My on demands would freeze late at night. That is when you need it most. When there are no good shows on! They always blamed me/My home/My box. I went in to get new boxes and all of the cords they gave me to plug into the wall were the wrong ones!! All. Amazing. They were not apologetic. And refused to let me talk to the manager. Was my highest bill. Ludicrous. Netflix is 10 times or more less. It is a monopoly basically. They scam you. They can do what they want. And they don't feel bad. They made me literally sick. Made me cry. Didn't even attempt to keep me; a 15 plus year customer. Refused to let me talk to a manager many times. Comcast truly felt like a cult. And went out of their way to give me bad service. Acting like... I personally bothered them."
"Customer of Snohomish, WA","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"No written contract. When I call I am shuffled around. When my alarm needed servicing, I was charged $50 without warning. Always seem to have TV and internet - except for a few times when the router went out or some such thing. When I signed up for a 3 year contract I got no written contract, nothing in writing and in my 3rd year my price skyrocketed (supposed to be a $10 increase per year). I think Comcast's motto is to get the most money you can out of the most customers. Highly unethical - and don't bother calling the AG's office or complaining to the FTC. They don't care and only send you back to Comcast to re-hash your problem. We pay waaay toooo much for these services. And I am a nex cable subscriber - having just got it Nov. 2013. My internet has gone out a few times and I need to call in - or go online to reboot it. Pain. TC/Cable and telephone seem most reliable. Again they gave me no manuals or paperwork/contract. I had voice mail for almost a year before realizing I had it as no messages were being recorded on the old answering machine. Comcast seems not to want to provide you with your contract in writing and when you call them - they have no record of it either!"
"George of Denver, CO","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"Rarely I get a competent support member. At best, they're apathetic and doing the bare minimum. At worst they're downright rude and condescending. The X1 box is nice, but I think overall the rental fees are too expensive. Really hoping the FCC will open up the market so I won't have to be robbed by Comcast each month. However, as I said, the X1 makes it a little easier to swallow. (This is only referring to the cable box, I don't use their modem, as I have my own Motorola Surfboard.) I think it's overpriced all around. And, just my own pet peeve, if you subscribe to a premium channel, I think every feed of the channel should be offered in high def. Little things like that would go a long way for customer satisfaction. But they don't care, they're the only game in town. In the two plus years I've had Comcast, it has been up 99% of the time. If Google Fiber moved to Denver, I would drop Comcast so fast it would make your head spin. Since that's not an option right now, I just wish Comcast had more value for the high prices paid overall. And that the FCC opens up the converter box market."
"Pat of Minneapolis, Minnesota","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"I really don't think they know what they are doing. It is very frustrating if you are stuck with calling them. I feel like they have you jumping thru hoops till a miracle happens. We had patch of on again-off again service and we ended up replacing our router and that seems to have helped sooo don't know if patchy service in the past is all linked to that. Also originally we leased our modem and we decided to buy our own. The one we bought looks like the one we leased. I suspect Comcast is not happy losing the revenue and they might increase the aggravation of hooking it up (it was not easy when we did). Plus if we have any problem, they are likely to blame it on our modem. Our only other option is AT&T (I live in Minneapolis) and I have heard they stink too. So 2 stars is probably standard for this area. I have heard there is potential for another high speed carrier in NE Minneapolis but Comcast and AT&T would lose big bucks and I'm sure they are buying off whoever they can to stop it. John my roommate says big downloads are a big problem. "
"Marcia of Richmond, IN","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"The last time I called for help, I was transferred to three different people then disconnected. When I got home, I had no DVR service. Another call, disconnected once then, finally, a nice man helped get service back on. I do not like Comcast service. Every person has a different answer or no answer and transfers you and then there is a disconnect. Very frustrating. We got a new TV because we thought the old one had terrible HD quality. But, come to find out, it was the DVR box that was the problem. The HD part did not work. A new box was installed and the service person did not know how to set up the closed caption feature. He had us using two controllers every time we wanted closed captioning. In the end, we figured it out all by ourselves! Actually, we have had little trouble with reliability. Fingers crossed! The cost is too high, there are too many options. I would like to be able to choose my own channels and have fewer, but ones I watch all the time. Way too many channels and it seems like there is still nothing of value to watch."
"M. of Valparaiso, IN","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"Hard to understand the Techs from overseas. They are programmed robots. If I tell them the problem and what steps I've taken to resolve the issue, they still make you take the same steps, (reboot, restart, etc). Most of the time the service for internet is good but at times the high speed internet isn't very high speed. Their value is that they provide a decent service at a high price without much competition. Sometimes it won't work. I understand that cable and internet go down sometimes but it seems too often. There are not a lot of options in our area if someone wants Cable TV or internet. I'm hoping that more options present themselves in the future. I think I heard Google has something in the works. I think if Comcast loses enough business, maybe they will start to listen. They charge enough already and are getting rich from it, how about providing better customer service? Comcast seems to have a Monopoly on the market right now. Like Ma Bell, it might need to be looked at by legislature and broken up. It's too big of a conglomerate."
"Rick of Santa Clara, CA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"Robotic in their responses, reading a script and they seem more interested in you having a positive review of them. Granted when tested it get high speed results but the quality is poor proofed by all the interruptions streaming and stalling when surfing the web, it frequently stalls or can't open a page. Poor value if everything ran without stalling and we could watch a movie without interruption and we didn't have such poor performance from phones that rely on our internet feed I might be happy paying over a hundred dollars a month for the internet and what few channels we are allowed for the tier we are at. Reliability is nonexistent. I know of no one that is satisfied with Comcast/Xfinity service but business. We live in the heart of Silicon Valley and we can't get a better more reliable service, why is that? The rich neighborhoods do not seem to have these problems. This just stalled again for about 20 seconds and again just then, pathetic."
"Regina of Carmel, CA","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"They have consistently offered temporary rates to keep me as a customer, and then increase the rates when the period expires. They consistently offer better pricing to new customers than to existing customers. There are frequent outages or service slowdowns (internet speeds slow or the cable service has to reboot). If there were another cable (not DSL) internet provider in my area, I would certainly switch. Their services are extremely poor and extremely expensive. I will switch at the first opportunity. I have spent countless hours on the phone due to service and billing issues. Countless hours means that I have spent upwards of 50 hours on the phone with Comcast over the last two years. It is the single worst consumer service experience I have ever had. It took ONE year for Comcast to resolve static in my cable TV signal and FIFTEEN months to resolve internet signal problems, that were due to a faulty modem, that they refused to replace for 18 months, despite 7 or 8 different service calls."
"V of Big Lake, MN","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"There is no customer support. I tried for several days to get an error on my bill resolved. I was transferred several times, and nobody solved my problem. I finally complained on a social site, and some Comcast executive contacted me and eventually fixed my billing error. I spent 20 years developing World Class customer service, and this company completely fails in all aspects. The more you spend, the worse the service. More in infomercials, commercials, buying programs. Seriously? I finally quit the TV, and use broadcast TV. Yes I still get all of the commercials etc, but at least I am not paying for them. The internet is supposedly the fastest, but still cuts out, especially during streaming movies from Netflix, and the audio is sometimes horrendous. The installer had to replace the equipment twice, because it was faulty. Nobody should have to pay hundreds of dollars for internet and/or TV."
 of Other,"Feb. 24, 2016",1,"Extremely long waits, disconnects while waiting for customer service. More than half of the time they cannot solve the problem and want to send a tech out to your home at YOUR expense. Extremely expensive, we pay 140.00 a month for cable & internet with no special channels. Simply said they STINK! Horrible. For instance we were paying $160.00 a month for cable (with no added special channels) and internet (the slowest speed). It's extremely hard to fork out this much money in an economy such as this one. My mom is an 89 yrs young woman on a fixed/limited income so we help out as much as we can. So last month I called them to see if they were running any specials, because those are NEVER offered to the consumer that has been with them since the start of cable. We were able to save her approx 20.00 a month but again this is for a limited time. For what they charge and what you get does not equal value. Never on time even with a one hour window."
"S of Enfield, NH","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"Customer service reps are generally polite and helpful, as long as the concern is one they know how to address. If they aren't able to address the issue quickly, I have been disconnected. Initially pretty good. Recent ""upgraded"" remote does not accommodate a surround sound system. I'm back to using 2 remotes. Three days a month of lost service. Hours on the phone trying to get service back. They decided I lived in a different town than the one I live in, which has caused issues since initiating service a number of years ago. If I had another choice, I would drop Comcast. The new ""upgraded"" system was a pain to install, required hours on the phone and in their chat room to get it going. Some features are good on the new remote, lack of ability to sync with surround sound system is not good. Once problems start they can continue repeatedly for 24-48 hours. Generally service reliable, except when it is not! Chat room assistance is a joke. Wish I had another choice."
"Katherine of East Falmouth, MA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"I have called multiple times for various problems and it's like I never called before. They have no record of my complaint, only that I have called. I have been waiting two weeks for a downed cable in the middle of our road. The fire dept finally had to come and cut the cable for safety reasons. They seem clueless and could care less every time I have called with an issue. They are a ripoff and continues to try and find ways to pork the customer. Such as, raising internet prices for customers who watch Netflix more than cable. They're going to find a way to make more money any way they can. I have never experienced a worse cable company than Comcast. I've called multiple times for this recent downed wire and they tell me each time the customer service representatives didn't put any notes in the system. Are you kidding me??? They suck, and if I had another option for internet, local news, and sports, I would cancel Comcast in a heartbeat."
"Jeff of Highland Park, NJ","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"They berate the customer. ""Yes, we are more expensive because we are the best"". They also have a monopoly and charge 30% higher than if competitors were available. Goes out quite frequently for hours at a time. Quite dangerous where I live. It is senior's housing. No emergency phone backup without paying an additional fee. Basic is expensive with extra charges for router, HD, DVR. Network access was raised by over 40% this past January. Premium channels went down in price but nearly double what I can get it for on the internet alone. Cannot count it as being up. After it comes back up the router takes several minutes to get services back in line including critical phone line. Even though WIFI is included, the signal is so poor it can not be accessed in the hallways of the building. Signal is quite weak, especially with hotspots surrounding our building. I cannot get the cartwheel to work in my local Target due to the weak WIFI signal."
"Elizabeth of Fairfield, CA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"If you have a problem with internet access and call in, you get to sit on hold with a system that tells you to go online to solve your problem... Exactly how am I supposed to do that when I have no internet service? Basically, there's no support at all. System has outages every single day - they may only be for 30 seconds, but 30 to 50 a day is too much. You cannot stream anything which I think is on purpose. They want $164 for internet and cable that comes with 86 channels we'll never watch, 5 channels we actually watch, and crappy reception. Constantly dropping off line; you absolutely cannot order a PPV movie because it won't play all the way through, you can't use streaming because the signal is constantly dropped and forget about trying to DVR anything - that doesn't work. I hate my cable service. I pay all of this money for absolutely nothing. All we get are excuses about trees, weather and unknown outages."
"Heather of Tacoma, WA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"I was moving and turning them off. Called to check the date that I needed to contact them AGAIN to close out the account. Because they won't due it mid cycle. They bill a month in advance. So I wanted it turned off before they billed for that new month. So I was very careful. Called on THE day. Left immediately afterwards and stood in line for an hour to turn in my one box - again - didn't want that additional bill. The girl says - ""You're good! You got it."" 6 weeks later I get a bill. That after calling them - they insisted I needed to pay. So I waited for as long as I could and paid it. 6 weeks later I got a check back for the same amount. I turned off my cable over 4 years ago and don't regret it. Still don't miss it. And these monopolizing idiots will never get another red cent from me. Internet only. Who can watch 400 channels at once? Let it go people. Unplug. Go play outside!!!"
"Meredith of Marietta, GA","Feb. 24, 2016",3,"It is IMPOSSIBLE to talk with a real person when you try to phone. It is equally impossible to report problems through e-mails. I have tried to report unburied cable in my neighborhood and I cannot reach anyone by phone or internet. WORST customer service ever! My cable box stopped working. It took three different ""technicians"" to replace a new box. I was told that all the XFINITY boxes have been recycled. I think I am paying too much for just internet and cable TV (not the top of the level). Internet service and TV service frequently go out. The prices for my limited service increase on a regular basis. I would use another company if I could but satellite dishes get no reception where I live. The customer service element is simply non-existent. They have customers who cannot voice their opinions."
"Angela of Gaithersburg, MD","Feb. 24, 2016",4,"The past 5 years has seen an increase in accessibility and civilness. My service has been quite good. I've never lost service in 12 years. There was a time when I had pixelating service, and it took 2 or 3 phone calls, but we finally determined my cable box was too old, and needed replaced. So did the TV. The new HD service is crystal clear. I HATE paying the $160 a month for a ""basic"" level service. It's backbreaking. I don't even watch that much TV, but you don't have a choice. You are forced to the package they are selling. Can't wait for a-la-carte TV service! I want what I want, when I want it. But I don't want the other zillion channels or phone service that I won't use. I have been paying for something that I only use a portion of. Oddly, I turned off Cable service THIS MORNING. I'm going off the grid, and moving on to Amazon or Hulu. 'Nuff said."
"I of Wilmington, NC","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"Awful, 3 days to come out when an outside cable was cut somewhere. Service people, both at the call centers and technicians that come to your house, are untrained and don't understand how their equipment works. Recently Comcast forced me to upgrade to Xfinity by popping up a message on our TVs every 1/2 hour or so saying that if we didn't upgrade we would lose access to some of our stations. We always paid a little extra to have 2 separate Comcast DVD recorders so my wife and could record and delete our own programs on our separate TVs. When I was forced to upgrade I contacted Comcast Xfinity department on 3 separate occasions to confirm that if we installed 2 Xfinity DVDs we could still record and delete programs independently on our respective TVs and there would be no increase in cost.When I installed the Xfinity DVRs there was no way to keep them separate as they both kept programs on the same web based cloud server. Delete a program from one and it is deleted from both DVRs. Called Xfinity support again and they apologized and said we just needed a filter installed, a 5 minute job for their tech which they scheduled to come install it saying there would be no charge. Tech came, installed the filter in multiple places with no success, called his supervisor who said the DVRs could not be separated as promised. They charged me $60 for this experience and when I called to complain about it Comcast argued and argued and finally offered to reduce the $60 charge by $25! After another 20 minutes of arguing on principle I was transferred to another supervisor who finally removed the charges.After installing the Xfinity I had multiple other problems. I discovered they had been charging me for high speed internet for a very long time, but the modem they rented to me was incapable of high speed internet. I had them send me another modem and they charged me for multiple modems. Then had problems with static on my Comcast phone line, and still do, and a third small Comcast box on a bathroom TV. Comcast sent out another tech for these problems and charged me again. Told this tech about my experience with being told that my DVRs could be kept independent and he was surprised that they couldn't be separate. The tech said they have to learn these things from customers as they have no training on new equipment, they just receive an email message that they are going to be installing new devices and give absolutely zero training on them.Many bad charges, many, many calls to Comcast taking hours and hours, it takes about 10 minutes for each call just to get through phone menus before you get someone in India or somewhere that is hard to understand and who tells you what they can read from a computer help screen and still my phone has static, my DVRs don't work as promised and I am being charged for all the equipment that I have returned to Comcast. I have never disliked a company in my 68 years as much as I dislike Comcast. Finally, in the next couple of months, RCN and ATT Uverse will be available and Comcast will lose the hard wire monopoly they have had since the beginning. I can't wait! Vastly overcharges for services because it has a monopoly. When my cable, internet and phone all went down because the Comcast cable was cut outside somewhere it took Comcast 3 full days to send a repairman. My phone still does not work properly. Customer service at Comcast is just plain awful and incompetent which they only got away with because they had a monopoly on high speed internet and hard wired cable TV. This will end soon as will many years of suffering with Comcast."
"Cynthia of Canton, GA","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"Minimally, it takes five minutes before you reach a live person due to their automated answering system. Some customer service representatives tell you one thing, but they do something quite different. For example, a credit that I was promised for loss of internet service (due to a defective modem) was never applied. This meant that I had to call them a second time. For more than a year, I had a defective modem. I never received the speed that I was being charged for. Sometimes, I would lose internet connectivity. When watching channels like Netflix, the program would repeatedly stop and buffer numerous times during the film. Comcast would not admit that their equipment was the problem until the modem broke down. Then, Comcast attempted to charge me for installation services when they sent a technician to my home to replace the defective modem. There is no local Comcast area in my town, so I have to make a 30 drive (in good traffic) to get to their center. It can take up to two or three hours of wait time for service depending on the time of day and the day week to pick up and/or drop off equipment. I am canceling my service with Comcast as soon as my contract expires in March 2017. I originally was with AT&T, but they no longer service my area. Comcast is a giant monopoly. Monopolies do not have to be responsible to the public they serve. Comcast/Xfinity does not care that their customer service personnel are rude and ignorant. Why? We the consumers have nowhere one else to go! A monopoly can set prices at whatever it wants (called ""price fixing""). A monopoly creates inflation since they can set any price they want to. A monopoly can sell inferior products (e.g., their modem). A monopoly has no incentive whatsoever to provide better service and products because there is no competition. This is a very sad situation. Due to systematic deregulation by our ineffective US Congress, Comcast/Xfinity has been allowed to dominate and control the telecommunications market. I do not recommend this company to anyone."
"peggy of Boulder, CO","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"If one wants it... one has to actually head down in one's car to get an English speaking representative or a person of knowledge and even that is iffy. It's as if doing things by telephone has become obsolete... so, we take a step backward and actually have to physically TRAVEL to obtain results or closure. When one does enter the store, one may as well consider himself in a third world country where making the all important DEAL is what it is all about. The bartering, the bantering, the apologizing, and the emotions involved are ridiculous. There should be ONE price for one set of services for ALL. But... NO... We gotta work to get a deal with a corporate twist of crap! What EVER happened to fair practice and timely results? Each time I've called Comcast to complain, I've gotten no satisfaction. They play GOD with the channels, giving and taking as arbitrarily as the storm of Spring. I hate cable. It used to be a pleasure, many years ago. It rarely goes out. Maybe it should... I'd be less paranoid about my health... having to watch the trillion commercials ranging from ingrown toenails to heart valve replacement... and all the funky names of all the crazy medications related to these afflictions. LOL. I live behind a HUGE hill. Were it not for the hill, I'd try one of those analogue transmitters in a heartbeat. TV sucks and there are very few shows I LOVE any longer. I used to have to record so many shows in the old days... didn't want to miss a beat. Either I'm older and wiser or the menu for entertainment has gone from a night at The Bonjour Bistro to Burger King. It rarely fails. Actual transmitting is fine with my basic package. My neighbor has another story as she has all the bells and whistles and complains constantly that she must unplug and replug. I hate the POWER these folks have over us. Our tv, phone, and internet are theirs. And they raise the prices with no regard to the income of others. It's one size fits all. What a shame."
"V of Gibbstown, NJ","Feb. 24, 2016",2,I had extremely slow internet for YEARS and they would tell me that it was my computer - It ended up to be THEIR Modem... They only credited me $20 for 2 months. Recently went to cancel my cable because my bill went from $160 to $225.00 and they told me I could NOT Cancel on Sundays. Somehow they only Cancel cable subscriptions on Sunday? I would spend on average 2 hours on the phone with this company to try and lessen my bill and end up with a HIGHER Bill. Recently I canceled my cable & they told me to drop off all the equipment at one of their conveniently located brick and mortar buildings... They have CLOSED All the Comcast buildings close to me - I have to drive over a half hour away to get this equipment back. It's too expensive for the options I have. I couldn't pause and watch a program in another room like advertised unless I wanted to be price gouged for it. On top of that they have a monopoly on MLB - What a scam. The boxes are old and antiquated. They drain electricity even when off and I would lose sound if I paused and played back a DVR Recording. I don't have a landline phone but had to pay for one - just to get a discount because SOMEHOW It's More expensive to have LESS than to have More? I'm not understanding that... but I still paid into it for awhile. Makes me feel really Stupid. Really Really Stupid. Sure - it was very reliable. Didn't go out because of inclement weather - so yeah - it was reliable. I would like Comcast and Verizon to stop price fixing everything to be so damn high. You all make billions of dollars and you RENT the remotes to us? That's just ludicrous - you RENT The boxes? Let people know that they may have the option to purchase these items. Instead of making so much money off of them.
"Monica of Vallejo, CA","Feb. 24, 2016",2,"It takes over 5 minutes of listening to a phone tree, advertising, and suggested additional products before one even gets to the queue for an agent. Sometimes the agents are knowledgeable. Sometimes the agents are clearly not native English speakers, and between lousy phone connections and unfamiliar accents (give me few minutes and I always get them), it is very difficult to do business by telephone. The chat service is very time consuming, even longer than a phone call due to the distances the messages are traveling, most frequently out of the Western Hemisphere. In store help is the same: inconsistent. Try to get an idea of your basic monthly bill amount: it is always understated, yet all the fees, taxes, etc., are static. TV pixelates often; phone service is adequate. Internet is very fast, but I pay quite a bit for that internet speed. Cable TV industry needs to realize that consumers like me would be happier if we could select from stations/programs/movies/tv shows as we go. Have a basic charge for the equipment and availability, then add on the additional channels. I have over 200 channels I don't use just to get the 10 channels I do watch. It seems that this type of monopolistic business model is inevitably going to kill itself off with services like AppleTV, Hulu, Netflix, etc., that are less expensive and easy to use. It is as reliable as overhead cabling will allow. If service were run underground, there would no doubt be fewer weather-related interruptions. If I did not need very high speed internet for my work and my housemate didn't want the cable TV, Comcast would be out of my life in any minute. I went cable TV free for a year before my housemate moved in, and it was fine using a hi-def antenna."
"teresa of Murfreesboro, TN","Feb. 24, 2016",1,"After troubleshooting on the phone for an hour it was determined the receiver box was bad. Took it to the Murfreesboro office and exchanged for a new box. They took the new remote out-of-the-box and told me to use my old remote. Took the box home, hooked it up and worked with troubleshooting for over an hour to get their remote working. It was determined the old remote was not compatible with the new box. Told them to bring me a new remote because they would not give it to me at the office. Charged me $50 on my bill for bringing out the remote. Called customer service and they said the old remote was compatible with the new box and they had to charge me for bringing it out that I could have gone to the office again to correct their mistake. Would only credit my bill $25 instead of 50 they charged me. It was their mistake!"
"Zuri of Glassboro, NJ","Feb. 23, 2016",1,"Today I've received my bill and it went from $136 to $153. To be honest I was satisfied with this company until today. I was told my bill was going to be high the first 3 months and after that it was supposed to go down to at least $120. Now I have to pay $153 because of all the ""fees"" and whatnot. I know I ordered movies but aren't they supposed to be added on the monthly bill that you ordered them? They are charging me for the movies three months later and I don't think that's fair. This is an issue that needs to be fixed specially because I love this company. I am so disappointed and I will end up going back to Verizon if this keeps happening. I am not satisfied at all after all this. I am hoping this gets fixed. Be careful before signing the contract because they might tell you all these beautiful things about what they can do to help and at the end they are going to turn their back on you. I do not recommend this company at all."
"Gene of Atlanta, GA","Feb. 23, 2016",1,"I have been a Comcast customer for 2 years but just switched to another provider. While there were periodic service issues during my first year of service, Comcast addressed the issues and the pricing was generally as promised. The middle of last year, I noticed the service prices began increasing, without any dialogue or notice. When I inquired I was given a new rate which was confirmed by a Comcast service rep email and actually billed and paid for one month. The next month, I received a bill almost twice what I had been quoted, billed and paid the prior month. When I inquired, the rate was jumped even more the next month. All of these rate increases were made without notice, awareness, discussion with or approval by me.In December my service went out. It took 3 weeks for it to be fixed by running a new line from the pole to the house. I received several promises of service visits before the problem was actually addressed after the new year. Here are several specific problems with Comcast. Price - there are actually different prices for identical service depending on whether you sign up at the store, over the internet or over the phone. Promotions available from one source may not be available from another source. There are various fees, that can add $20 to $40 to your monthly bill. Many of these will be charged or waived depending on who you are interacting with. To get the best current price, you are forced to sign up for a 2 or 3 year contract at whatever future price they elect to subsequently put in place, even during the first year of the contract. If you are a Verizon customer, you supposedly get a Comcast discount. However, you are never told what it is or when it applies, or more importantly when it does not.Billing - You are automatically billed any price changes. Any agreed to adjustments are generally not applied until after you have paid the incorrect amount. If you pay only the adjusted bill, you are hit with a late charge even though what you paid is what was agreed to as the correct amount due.Customer Service - There are at least 3 levels of customer service. The general telephone number, the lowest level, has very limited authority and knowledge of anything. You are put on hold and transferred. You can appeal to the VP of Customer Service which gets you to someone with more authority. If you are not satisfied you can appeal to the FCC who will pass your issue back to Comcast and get you a higher level review. These may or may not resolve your problem. You can never get back to the same person you originally spoke to on a problem. You are continually repeating the same problem to different people. Each person is entering something in your file concerning the call but you have no idea what it is. The next person you call most likely does not read the file but, even if they do, the correct information may not be in it. You are dealing with different people with different knowledge, training and language skills. Some actually lie or don't have any idea what they are talking about. When this happens, if you ask to speak to a supervisor you are told no one is available, put on an indefinite hold or disconnected.When you get referred to technical support or someone is sent out, you get a wide variety of capability. Some try to help you self-diagnose over the phone. The technicians sent out may know the internet and modem but not the phone or TV. Only the telephone technician can climb the pole. Some technicians sent out are third party contractors who can only diagnose. The technician sent out may have no information on the problem or a problem indicated which does not exist, Of course, you are then billed for the call even though the service rep said you would not be billed. You then go through the billing adjustment cycle described.Overall - One department of Comcast does not communicate with another. It is assumed that everything is in your file. However, it frequently is not depending who you are communicating with, their knowledge and skill, and, frankly, what they choose to document. I have actually been told that an adjustment to my bill was logged as a courtesy discount when I was out of service. I can only assume this was due to an attempt to manipulate the service statistics.Service Termination - When you terminate, you are told you will lose your phone number which belongs to Comcast even when you ported it to Comcast from another provider. You are told that you will lose your email address. When pressed, the service rep may acknowledge you can port the phone number and have 30 days to set up another email. Yes, I had all of these experiences with Comcast over the last 6 months. I have been repeatedly lied to even when pointing out discrepancies and naming previous contacts. This is why I terminated service."
"Yuleidys of Miami, FL","Feb. 23, 2016",1,"My brother and I contacted Comcast on February 2nd this year. We moved to an apartment and need cable and internet services. The person who attended our call was Yunior, or at least that's the name he gave us. Well this gentleman told my brother and I coz phone was on speaker and I took notes of our conversation, that our bill will be of $132 a month, with FREE HBO for a year and that our internet was unlimited and with a speed of 75! I asked him many times during the conversation about the HBO and the internet and always told us the same answer. Now we got the first bill and surprise, surprise! Comcast is charging us $15 for the HBO and my internet never gets neither to 35! So we called and one of the representatives told us that he could see the promotion but that was not applied to our account and he transferred our call to another department. This new guy told us that in our address there was not promotion for the HBO and that we'll need to pay the full amount and also that we had a contract with Comcast! Which nobody mentioned! They lied to us. They don't care about customer service. They're just into our money! We spoke with one of the supervisors and told us the same answer. Also there's no unlimited internet!!! We can't use more than 300g because they said the government don't allow us to be that much searching and that if we persist going over that quantity we'll need to go to a different agency and request a permit to be using internet. Everything is BS!! This people sucks! They told us that we have 30 days to cancel our service and I'm considering to do it. This is our first month with the company and lies are all over the place!"
"Susan of Downers Grove, IL","Feb. 22, 2016",1,"In August 2015 I went to an Xfinity (Comcast) store and asked that our home phone line with AT&T get bundled in with our existing internet and cable TV service with Comcast. I was told this would be a seamless task - NOT SO!! Our phone service has been disconnected 2X by AT&T but they continue to bill us monthly. Comcast is also billing us for the home line. They've overcharged us. Said we'd get credits applied to our bill but still haven't. Each company is pointing the finger of blame to the other company. We've dealt face to face with representatives of each company who are polite, understanding but extremely ineffective. We're about to have our Comcast service interrupted due to an unpaid balance. My husband is 74 and I'm nearing 67. This has been such a struggle for us and is very upsetting. We do not know how to get resolution on this with both companies. Please advise. Thank you."
"Florencio of Tacoma, WA","Feb. 21, 2016",1,I had Comcast Cable Service and I updated last year so this year I wanted to cancel my services and they told me that I was under contract that I have to pay a penalty if I cancel. Before I use their services I ask them if I need it a contract and they say no and that's why I use their services. So know every time you talk to them is like you upgrade your services and they put you another year on the so call contract which is a rip off to hold customers that can afford to pay those penalties. They should be more honest and not give you false information about this false contract. Please investigate this matter. They should tell you before you get the service that you are going to be in a contract not when you want to cancel.
"james of Maryville, TN","Feb. 20, 2016",1,"I've had comcast triple play package for over a year and yes several times I've had to argue with a ROBOT over billing issues. Three weeks ago someone in their office decided to turn off my phone. I've spent at least twenty four hours on the phone with dealing different ROBOTS. The problem I'm having is that they set a ticket for a technician to come out and guess what, they to call me and verify that I'm home. ROBOTS can't THINK that. Because I don't a land line. I can't answer the phone to say I home."
"Patrick of Gresham, OR","Feb. 20, 2016",1,2-10-16 I called Comcast to get a new remote code. I was offered a deal for TV and internet for $69.99 plus tax and got an email from them that was incorrect. I talked to them again the next day and was told the same thing. I asked for an email which I never received. After that I was given the runaround for at least 3 calls in a row. Always a different offer always higher than the last offer. BAIT AND SWITCH plain and simple. They try to tell me that their employee was incorrect... That doesn't cut it. They are responsible for what their employees say and or offer.I still have not gotten an email back from the last time I talked to them which was 2-16-16. It is now February 19th. This company is terrible. I have not dealt with a bigger bunch of crooks in my life. If I did what they do in my profession I would lose my license and most likely be sued... I still have the option supposedly to cancel with no cost. We will see how that works out. I am going to call the state Fraud department and make a complaint.
"Daniel of North Salt Lake, UT","Feb. 20, 2016",1,"Got a guy come out, said they sent me the wrong cable to make this work right. We had problems, they said they would put that it was their problem and would fix the service fee. Online looked like they did but one month later it was triple the amount. This Comcast is the worst ever. I don't know why people use them. I'm done and going to look at my bank card to prove it. I know I paid them every month but they seem to lose payments."
"Bruce of Colonia, NJ","Feb. 19, 2016",1,"Sadly this company has gone downhill rapidly in the last 5 years, although their rates go higher and higher, as they swallow up more and more of the competition. Over the last two weeks I have done nothing but battle with one idiot after another, that tells you anything and delivers nothing, only to find out when you do finally get a supervisor which is rare, that the employee you spoke with was wrong. Comcast has tried to take a payment out of my account 3 times in a one week period, although the payment was made online days before the due date. When questioned as to why, the answer was ""Once in progress it can't be stopped."" Oh yes it can, if the bank removes their ACH privileges with your account which I did.But that did not solve the problem. As I was never told by anyone that another payment was due 4 days behind the initial one I made online. Instead of calling and explaining, I wake up to be shut off. After 7 phone calls, and being disconnected 4 times I finally reached a supervisor, who went through my entire last 30 days of activity with me, and explained that the last three people I had spoken with about this over the last week gave me the incorrect information and apologized for it. When I asked why these folks were allowed to say what they did and also withhold certain details, and if they would be reprimanded, the subject was quickly changed.It is a merry band of thieves that sticks together and covers each other backs, right or wrong. They seem to only hire lower level people that tell you what they have to or what you want to hear in a prescribed time to get you off the phone, regardless if the information they are giving is right or wrong. And if you raise your voice even one octave you will end up being disconnected or sent back in to the pool to wait for someone else. Do not expect refunds even if you are promised them, they will only credit your account. Even if you are told to fax bank statements over, you are wasting your time. It will not happen. Why they even tell you to do this, if they have no intention of honoring the request is beyond me. But sadly we have no choice here the state of N.J., it is them or satellite which is even less reliable. That no competition is allowed is really baffling and possibly unethical as well."
"Brian of Kent, WA","Feb. 19, 2016",1,"On December 22, 2015 I had a chat conversations with Comcast agent Robert to renew my internet deal. But my Feb bill went up to 66.43. I call many times but none of the rep and supervisors were able to explain why my deal is not kept. This company suck and I wouldn't recommend it."
"Anna of Portland, OR","Feb. 19, 2016",1,"We have been LOYAL customers to Comcast for years. We moved our service after being with them for years and we're told there would be no fee. We had a special promotion for a year and when we moved our service we noticed on our first bill the pricing went up $150 plus we were charged a fee to move service. Come to find out they re-start your contract when you move service WITHOUT telling you but with no special pricing. When we called to cancel service after a year they told us we have to pay an early cancellation fee even though we have been with them for 3 years!! This is because they restarted our account when we moved service. Comcast customer service is the worst and punishing loyal customers is just sad.Do not move your service with Comcast - you are better off canceling and going with someone else or cancel and restart service and save yourself the headache because there is ABSOLUTELY NO PERKS for you the customer to moving service! They basically punish you for moving by charging fees, restarting your contract without telling you, and charging a higher rate for service. Thanks Rob Comcast ""Customer Loyalty"" (what a joke) for your lack of help. Worthless. Just look at all the complaints with them and call someone else!!"
"Sheryl of Loganville, GA","Feb. 18, 2016",1,"A customer for over 6 years, I had contracted over the phone for promotion services in June 2015. In December 2015 my bill went up some $20. I called and was told part of the services agreed to in June was for 6 months, the other part for 12 months. When I called in June I made notes on what the customer rep told me. When I asked for confirmation that my bill would be $104/month for the next 12 months the answer was ""Yes."" Thus, the next 6 months I was agreeing to 12 months no change billing not knowing PART of my verbal contract was to expire before 12 months.I have called numerous times going through the automated system over and over -- nicely wasting my time and increasing my dissatisfaction for the way Comcast wastes a customer's time. Similarly, when my wait for Customer Solutions (taking over 20 minutes to arrive at) was a dropped call (maybe deliberate??) my efforts to work with the company are a waste of time.In my opinion -- and experience -- Comcast is a bad faith business and its customer solutions is dedicated to correcting no issues with the sloppy, incompetent sort of employee that answers untruthfully to a question about a whole bill amount for the next 12 months. Of course, Comcast wouldn't need to improve training and ethics of employees because that would amount to conducting business with some modicum of integrity, willingness to correct employees' untruths made, deliberately or in error, on making changes in accounts on the phone.Do, please, review massive customer complaints about Comcast-Xfinity online BEFORE you call up and arrange to do business with them. After you're a customer what you're told on the phone may not be what you were led to believe, and you could even be strung along by a one-time Customer Loyalty credit. Make notes when you speak with Comcast employees. They may be duping you, and customer service has no authority to help you there!! Six MONTHS of increased billing that ensues just make that insult of a loyalty 'dog treat' laughable.Yes you can, as Customer Solutions said, write to a PO Box in Sterling, Michigan but there's no person named to address it to. You'd do better to write to the FCC and get a complaint file number, and if you're a member of a senior citizens blog with over 100,000 members like I am, be sure to share your experience with Comcast's deceptive telephone contracting for services! Or, let the company, customers, stockholders, government and other watchdog groups get yet another vote for Comcast to get the Worst Company Award of the year, decade, century!! I'm ready to invest in wireless.Factual Summary: I contracted for services. I noted affirmative billing for the next 12 months. I was misinformed or lied to because the employee did not inform me part of the services was for 6, not 12 months so the bill went up. Comcast cannot and will not honor the 12 month cost I agreed to, cannot or will not prevent this from happening anytime or every time, has a Customer Solutions department with no intent to provide solutions when employees may be involved in defrauding a customer by falsely answering questions. Why would they -- since integrity and ethics obviously has no presence in this corporate entity?"
"Dianne of Nashville, TN","Feb. 18, 2016",1,Have had Comcast and moved to a new home 1/2/16. Talked with numerous people at Comcast... My service was not stopped at the old address. Did not get a technician to the new address until 1/19... They did not finish and another technician came 1/21 and installed old cable boxes (3). I called several times and new boxes were mailed. As of 2/18 only one of the 3 tvs in my home works sometimes. Billing is still not resolved for the old address. Getting new bills for the new address when I had NO SERVICE and now another technician is coming 1/20 to resolve the problems and am being charged AGAIN for installation??? I cannot believe the customer service had been so poor. Your tagline... the future of awesome... It's definitely in the future because the last 7 weeks have been a nightmare. No one seems to be able to get the service fixed or the billing.
"Carmen of Seabrook, TX","Feb. 17, 2016",1,"Absolutely the worst experience of my life!!! The move took well over 9 hours on the phone (and many more since then), they messed up everything! Disconnected our phone at the existing house, yet it was not connected and could not be transferred to the new house, so they left us with no phone at either house and they swore the phone was at one location when it was physically at another location, they didn't even know what they had done. Then the cable was not connected at the new house, internet did not work at the new house, I had to get it fixed and all it was is that they had not plugged in the connection that comes from the street!They continue to charge us for services we asked from day 1 to not have - sports entertainment package, and service protection plan - I have to keep calling and yet the charges appear again. None of the services were set up correctly, wasted so much of my time, and they continue to sneak charges. I guess they think we won't look at our bills. I have even taken it off automatic payment because I cannot trust them."
"Diane of Conyers, GA","Feb. 16, 2016",1,"I have made over 21 phone calls, had 4 technicians to my home, one did not even turn on the TV. All of this since Christmas 2015. All 4 of my TVs are out again and I explained my job requires me to be out of my home for 3 days. The customer service rep insisted that she put something down and a supervisor would call me within 30 minutes. Well 13 hours passed and yes you guessed it - no supervisor ever called. So I called the next morning. They assigned me an Escalated service ticket to rush my needs. Well Another 12 hours and no response SO I called again this service rep called Shaki said she spoke to her supervisor and she ""promised"" and I quote ""Promised"" to call me back within the hour to give me some time. The service men will arrive at my home. Well you guessed it - 2 and 1/2 hours later no return call and now they are closed. So I am already speaking to their competition company and they seem very eager to help me. I would not recommend Comcast to my worst enemy."
"Jennier of Avon, CT","Feb. 15, 2016",1,"We had Comcast when we lived in Baltimore and had several issues, luckily Verizon offered cable and we were able to switch. We had Comcast/Xfinity at our house at least once a month with reception issues or simply no cable/internet service. Once we switched to Verizon we did not have a single issue, not a single issue. We relocated to CT, unfortunately our only option was satellite or Xfinity. We made the wrong choice. We live in an area with several trees and were afraid that would be an issue with satellite. Well it's been a year and a half, we've had a repair person or a hour plus conversation (after the usual unplugging the box repair) with customer service at least every other month. Once the contract is up we're going satellite of 100% smart tv. This is ridiculous. As I write this my tv is constantly pixelating, yes this is after the recommended ""unplug the box"" repair. P. S. I unplug this box at least 3x a week."
"Tana of Burnsville, MN","Feb. 15, 2016",1,"I called Comcast about 50 times trying to get through to them. Never any luck so I go down to the Comcast center and ask why my services aren't working. They were very rude and condescending. Didn't help me with my problem but told me they will disconnect me so I don't have to deal with them again. I been with them for 5 years. And this is how they treat their loyal customers.To top it all off. There was a massive amount of people and cars in their parking lot because of everyone having issues with them, so another customer and I got into a car accident right in front of the store. The person that helped me came out and took pictures and was laughing. How rude is that?! Very unprofessional and they are just a money hungry group of people that don't provide any services they say they do. Not hi-speed internet, you get a TV box with no channels and all of that for the price of $180 a month. What a deal!!! I would stearate far away from this place. COMCAST ARE SCAM ARTIST! They will give you a deal for your first 6 months then 100 turns into 200 and your bill doesn't stop going up, EVER!! Every month there are more fees."
"Stephanie of Ellicott City, MD","Feb. 13, 2016",1,"I wanted to restart a new service at a new address today. They would not allow me to do so with my old account. There is a $23.74 credit sitting on my old account. I had to open a new one. I called to see if they could help me. Instead I was met with confusion, reluctance and being passed around 4 times. I was hung up on 3 times, one time I believe was on purpose because I was telling him I was just hung up on 2 times and need someone to help me and then he hung up on me. I have never felt so angry and disappointed with a company before and now I am stuck with them for a year until my contract is up. Train your staff!!! Get rid of them if they cannot do the job!"
"Sallyanne of Cape Coral, FL","Feb. 12, 2016",1,"In August, Comcast/Xfinity told me I would get HBO, Starz and a phone line when I changed my seasonal account. I did get Starz. I asked why I wasn't getting HBO as I was promised and they told me I didn't ask for it. Then in October when I bitched enough, they gave me HBO for free. But they were giving me stream pics, which I know nothing about nor did I ever hear of it when I called. Now I called for a now X1 box as well as a modem and the one person who actually said they changed my account to Streampix was completely understanding. Tonight, I asked why I suddenly had Starz and not HBO. She said it couldn't happen until I had my new equipment. I haven't had Starz since November. How does that work and why should I have to be told I was basically a liar because I ""should have had"" Starz. The WORST company ever."
"Diane of Jacksonville, FL","Feb. 11, 2016",1,"Contacted Comcast Business services on 1/19/16 to arrange a move for my business on 2/1/16. The move included business internet and phone service. During the initial call, I was informed there would be no issue meeting the date of 2/1. Several weeks and over 10 hours of phone calls later, still no appointment was secured. I escalated to several managers, never receiving a reply. In the end, I went 9 days with no internet or phone service for my business which is based on sales and incoming calls. I was told the reason for the delay was that the associate who originally set up the move did not properly set up the phone transfer as I was moving to a new area code. At the end of the day, I was forced to pay for a temporary internet service, wasted over 15 hours on the phone with Comcast and went 9 days with a business that could not be run. The installer finally came on 2/9 and apparently installed the lines incorrectly which shut my cable system down. The residential cable tech fixed the issue and also informed me that the area code is the same as my old location. I have since confirmed that is the case. I ended up filing a complaint with the BBB last week and received a call back from Comcast. They informed me they would not do anything to cover my business losses and did not even apologize for the issues they caused. My frustration level with them continues to rise and I have absolutely no recourse at this point. Therefore, I want to share my story with anyone who will listen."
"Ronald of Santa Rosa, CA","Feb. 11, 2016",1,"So frustrating. I spent 90 minutes trying to set a watch list and parental control. I made 15 calls. I was referred to different specialized departments. English was not their 1st language. When I was sure they understood, they spent a lot of time trying to find what I needed. In the end, one rep said that there is no watch list for the future programs. The other person couldn't find parental controls and I found it on the TV and had to help her. I would be asked thing multiple times for the same info from the same rep. For instance, name, phone number, address, etc. This is not the 1st time I have gotten inferior service. Sometimes I'd be told that the engineers are working on the problems. Glad I don't have a contract."
"Jason of Pompano Beach, FL","Feb. 11, 2016",1,"I have had Comcast scam me numerous times. This time I took a month to month plan because I knew I would not have long enough for contract to took month to month plan. Two months later the bill was incorrect and called to fix, they advised taken care of. When I cancelled account I received a bill for early termination fee. I have called times and spent 45 min or more each time to be told it's taken care of and then today I get a call from a collection agency trying to collect the same amount again. Called Comcast again and they say they never said that. I know calls are recorded and I need help resolving this and Comcast runs all over consumers."
"catherine of Bloomington, IL","Feb. 10, 2016",1,"In December I contacted Comcast to set up service at my son's new apartment in the city he was going to college. Requested a start date of January 13, 2016. Shortly after my soon moved in his TV and internet service were not working. Odd, thought maybe it was an outage. Called Comcast and I was informed much to my surprise that the services were interrupted because of a past due balance from our first bill starting in December. I found this very disturbing because I did not request the service to begin until January 13, 2016. We had never received a bill and another tenant was living there until the last day of December 2015. This made me wonder why Comcast would bill 2 different accounts for the same address, for the same time period and why would a service be interrupted without a bill being sent. This I found all very strange. I called Comcast and after being disconnected and transferred 5 times, Kelli a supervisor in the billing department said she saw the problem and would get the bill corrected and issue a new bill. Not long after speaking with Comcast I received another call from the Comcast collections department. They were calling because I had a past due balance and the services were going to be t/off again. Spoke to another billing supervisor Patricia and she assured me that the services were not going to be interrupted and we should see a new bill soon. I asked Patricia what I should do if the service was t/off again. Patricia informed me that was not going to happen and that I could call back and speak with her if it did. She also waived the 12 dollar disconnect fee. Why would I have a disconnect fee when the billing error was not my fault? Today 02/10/16 the services have been t/off once again. Patricia was wrong, very, very wrong. Called Comcast again spoke to supervisor Josh. Josh informed me after reviewing the account that the services were off because of the past due balance. I asked Josh how I was to pay a bill I have never received. He stated that it was sent and Comcast could not t/on the service until it was paid. Asked to speak with his supervisor and he put in a request for a callback and stated it would be 24-48 hours before they would call. I asked for his supervisor's supervisor at which time he refused, stated he was putting in call back and that is all that can be done. I find these events very sad for a company the size of Comcast and I plan to change the service to DirecTV. Just wanted to let anyone that would listen know DO NOT USE COMCAST SERVICE FOR TV OR INTERNET."
"Amber of Powder Springs, GA","Feb. 10, 2016",1,"I didn't want to get Comcast to begin with but where we moved to AT&T Uverse doesn't get a good signal so I signed us up for the triple play with cable internet and security. In the beginning the service was ok at best but the problems began after the first few months of service with the kids' bedroom box ""intermittently"" cutting in and out. After troubleshooting tech came out and replaced the coax cable in the bedroom and also found an issue with the coax cable for the wifi which he replaced. All this with no charge to my account. The second issue arose several weeks later with the internet which they boast is the fastest download and upload speeds at 75 mbps however mine was barely getting 20mbps. After troubleshooting with customer service and having them assure me that I was not going to be charged for a tech visit we scheduled the repair.Tech came out, replaced the coax cable again and advised me that the only way I was going to get the maximum speed was to have my laptop directly connected to the modem... Hmmm interesting but ok, whatever. Tech leaves, no problem right? Wrong! I find that my account is charged a $70 tech visit for THEIR faulty equipment. I call to have this charge removed to be told it has been escalated to a manager and it would be taken care of, no worries. Wrong again! I pay my bill minus the $70 that I was assured would be removed only to have my service disconnected some days later for nonpayment. I try to rectify the situation but I cannot connect to customer service as I keep getting directed to billing which tells me that I have to pay my bill to have service restored and there's nothing they can do.I am completely and utterly livid at this point as I have company over so not to mention how embarrassing this feels. I pay the bill and immediately speak with customer service who apologizes and assures me I will receive a $70 credit to my account. This took me several calls and escalations to have this credit applied and you'd think my troubles would end there! Absolutely not. As we speak I am now experiencing issues with my security system. It began a couple months ago with my camera not working. Spoke with customer service who was clearly working from home because I heard her dog barking in the background and she'd try to mask out the sound by muting herself.Anyhow, went through troubleshooting and she told me that she can have a tech come out but I would be charged for the visit even though it's THEIR faulty equipment and offered a plan for me to pay an additional $4.99/month on top of the $220 that I already pay for this b.s. service which of course I decline and choose to go without the camera. Last week the security system app stops working and the touch screen is offline so I get a call from Comcast to troubleshoot which we did and found a tech needed to come out. They of course conned me into the $4.99/month and scheduled the tech. I receive 5 calls from some advanced technical department (foreigners) to do more troubleshooting which consisted of the exact same steps as we did with cust service which somehow brought the security system back online.However, since the camera is still not working I requested the tech still to come. I received 3 more calls from the ""advanced technical support"" group for the exact same issue to do the exact same steps with the camera. The last person I spoke with I requested he notated for them to not call me again and he said that he would. Not even 5 mins later I received another call! I have never in my life written a review but this has been the absolute worst experience, the worst service that I have ever received. Overpriced crappy service and I hope to be rid of them soon! Buyer beware!"
"Heidi of Roswell, GA","Feb. 9, 2016",1,"I have NEVER interacted with a company that has poor service as much as Comcast. I moved and was going to transfer my service to my new address. I set the date to move in 4 days. They erroneously disconnected my service immediately. I called and they reconnected but not all my channels I had paid for so I had to call them again. Then I called back to move my service to new location. Again, they did not give me all my channels then disconnected me. I spent over 12 hours on and off the phone over a 4 day period. Then I called and cancelled my service over the phone. They said it was cancelled and to return my equipment. I returned equipment and then closed out my account at the actual office. Then I received a bill so I paid it. The next day I received another bill showing that I had closed out my account and that I only owed $32 vs $129 so I contacted them and ask when my refund would be mailed. Comcast customer rep told me my service was still active. I told her it was closed on 1/21. She said her computers were down and she would call me within 7 days and confirm my account was closed and that I would receive a refund in 4 - 6 weeks. It has been a nightmare."
"Saundra of Park Forest, IL","Feb. 9, 2016",1,"Like most consumers, I was a bit dissatisfied when my Promotional Rate ended. So I called the Customer Care department to inquire about new or additional promotions. Long story short, I spoke with 4 different Reps who all lacked Empathy and were very uncaring. Please keep in mind that one of these Reps was a ""Supervisor"". Each of these Reps were told that I would possibly have to seek alternative services if they were unable to assist. Each one of them said ""OK"".I have received a bill from Comcast faithfully every month and have paid faithfully every month on time or early. I have not received any upgrades or had anyone out to explain that services are going to be wonderful for me and my family once the price increases. I say that because I'm unsure why I have to pay a higher rate for the same POOR SERVICE. All of our TVs have experienced some problem or another related to Comcast since we've had the service. None of our Remote Controls have worked properly since we've had the service. Every time I call Comcast, for anything, I have to hold for a minimum of 15 mins before someone tells me to call back tomorrow or there is nothing they can do for me. Comcast really needs to step up their game as it pertains to Customer Service."
"Marilynn of Quincy, MA","Feb. 8, 2016",1,"Tried to pay my bill on Saturday. Was not able to access account online. Got a message my email address wasn't connected to the account. So I called waiting over a hour to make payment. I gave up. Made payment through my bank online. Well they didn't get it fast enough, shut my cable off, charged me fees, and I called today 2-8. After 3 transfers and 45 min later I got my service back on. I was asked 3 times how I sent the money. They are a monopoly. I hate them and there is no other provider allowed in my area. It is so horrible the way they treat their customers."
"Michael of Memphis, TN","Feb. 8, 2016",1,Super Bowl 50. Epic Showdown. Friends were invited and the beer and food were served. But no game. Comcast cable (the service required by my apartment) decided to crap out 4 times during the game. Each time the cable box (provided by comcast and assured to be the latest model) reset itself would take 10 minutes. We missed half the game. I have been used to bad service from this provider but this was the straw that broke the camel's back. Will forever on refuse to buy comcast and spread the word to anyone and everyone to never ever use them.
"Raquel of Berywn, IL","Feb. 8, 2016",1,"I'm not going to mention all the lies I have been told over the years by the Comcast representatives, or all of the times they have continually raised my cable bill. How I never wanted a house phone, but I was told that I would save money if I did... Then bill went up AGAIN... Let's talk about the Super Bowl... How I am unable to watch any television on the ONE DAY they everyone in the US is watching the same thing. I CAN'T. WHY NOT??? CAUSE COMCAST SUCKS!!! Tomorrow, I will be getting DirecTV or Dish Network. My cable has been out for two hours and they estimate it will be off for another two hours... So basically, I can't watch TV at all tonight. Thanks Comcast for the great service you all provide... NOT!!!"
"Myisha of Greenbelt, MD","Feb. 7, 2016",1,"Comcast is the worst. All I wanted was to have a simple installation in my home and they couldn't even do that. When the first tech came he said he couldn't install because wiring to my apartment had to be done first so I had to call and make a separate appointment for that. When the second tech came he said the exact same thing but that was already establish the first time when I called back to customer service. The third tech was supposed to come between 8-12 and didn't call till 3:30 but by then I was already at work. Called back to schedule another appointment and the fourth tech never came but claim he knocked at my door (which he never did) and when I called customer service they said I would have to make another appointment.Customer service was NO HELP AT ALL. I got told something different every time I called and could never speak to a supervisor and no one who could actually help could call me back. It was always the ""I don't know what to say"" excuse from every representative I spoke with. Just straight unprofessional, rude and lazy. I would not recommend this provider to anyone!"
"Shirley of Norwich, CT","Feb. 7, 2016",1,"My cable bill increased and I called to see if I could get a better price without giving up my sports package. After much aggravation I was able to speak with a very nice young lady who lowered my bill slightly. I had to agree to a 2 year contract. At the time I was very happy with Comcast so I agreed. A month later Comcast dropped the YES network, the one channel that I watched faithfully all baseball season. Now I am stuck for 2 years, will not be able to watch my favorite team for 2 seasons. November 5, 2017 will be my last day as a Comcast customer."
"jay of Manteca, CA","Feb. 5, 2016",1,I cancelled my Comcast service. Reason they suddenly discontinue my promotion and bills comes too higher- and when I cancelled my service - after that I go through lots of hassle- After discontinue service- I got call from ** every other day asking someone calling from Comcast and need credit card number and all. Then it not stop and Comcast send me bill amount of $49. I paid. I received again second bill of $47 then I paid through online. And lastly I was shocked I got bill from southwest credit bureau amount of $47. What is this- is Comcast crazy after losing the customer- their behavior is too weird- They sending bill from last 3 months. Do not go for Comcast service. AT&T is the best internet service and Dish and Directv is the best- with the customer. I do not like Comcast at all. Stay away from Comcast.
"Jalisa of Margate, FL","Feb. 5, 2016",1,I set up Auto Pay in November 2015. Was told I will have to call in December's payment because it takes 30 days. Received a confirmation letter Auto pay was set up only to be told 02/04/16 it wasn't and was even charged a late fee for Comcast not doing their job. Please someone shut this company down quickly.
"Michele of Atlanta, GA","Feb. 4, 2016",1,"I don't have room for the detailed summary (it's 4 pages single spaced). We've been without cable for almost a month - multiple technicians and phone calls each telling us they promised to resolve our issue (1st technician never showed up despite us waiting for 2 hours then being told he'd be there within another hour). Total amount of OUR time spent (I started keeping track AFTER first missed appt) so this is on the low end: 17.5 hours waiting or at home with technicians and over 7.5 hours on the phone (calculated based upon cell phone records). This doesn't include multiple calls from my husband.Ultimately, they discovered the box they gave us was the problem. 20 minute install of new box, WOW it works now. Oh, and by the way - couldn't get any kind of response until we filed FCC Complaint. While that initially got corporate's attention - but even they didn't call back when they promised (and of course, they don't give YOU a number - heaven forbid you actually have the ability to call them).NOW, they want to make sure to compensate us for our troubles. I sent them the 4 pager. They agreed what we went through was awful and credited us a WHOLE month of cable - and then act like they're doing US a favor (by the way, did I fail to mention that we DIDN'T HAVE CABLE for most of the month). But wait, they threw in internet. $55 more dollars. SO generous. I guess according to COMCAST $55 is fair compensation for over 25 hours of their customer's time that could have been resolved in 20 minutes. Absolutely HORRIBLE excuse for customer service."
"Michael of Gainesville, FL","Feb. 4, 2016",1,"My mom is a senior citizen on a fixed income. Her encountered a bill increase. She asked me to contact Comcast to see if they could provide a discounted price. 1st phone call to customer service ended in a disconnection while representative was checking on offers. 2nd phone call resulted in a $10 discount and transfer to a customer loyalty representative to receive an additional discount. Customer loyalty representative spoke with her supervisor who suggested having a sales representative call me back with a new customer offer the same day. The bill is in my dad's name, he passed away 1 1/2 years ago. Nobody called. I called the next day. 1st phone call, disconnected when customer service representative picked up the phone. 2nd phone call, customer service representative referred me to a customer loyalty representative who was not able to provide an additional discount unless my mom took out a two year agreement which would save her an additional $10 a month. Told it was not possible to get a better price by setting up a new account, only additional inconvenience through interior of services. Large waste of time. Have contacted Comcast in the past, numerous disconnects, inconsistent advice from customer service representatives. Repeated bad experiences."
"Jessica of Miami Lakes, FL","Feb. 3, 2016",1,"Let me start off with if I could change broadband provider I would in a heartbeat but unfortunately Comcast is the only broadband internet provider in my area. I have been experiencing on and off issues for years with them and been waiting patiently for U-verse to come to my neighborhood with no such luck. Comcast doesn't fail to send us a bill each month and or raise their prices but they fail providing us the service we pay for. I did a huge mistake by ordering their new TV service X1 platform. Over half of the time it doesn't work. The internet speed isn't the speed we are being promised to receive when it is working. I've called Comcast customer care numerous times and even Comcast corporate.I've had techs out to my home, change all the wiring outside as well as equipment and nothing. The service will work for a day and back down the next. There have been 4-5 outages a week with Comcast since the end of Dec 2015. I am now given the runaround and told no there is a issue in the area which they're unsure when and if it will be resolved. I am first told a week then a week and a half and then a month or more. One tech left broken cables and connectors in my home knowingly there is a toddler in my home. Could've been a choking hazard. This company is a joke and do not care about their customers. I have asked Comcast since they're unable to resolve the issue Š—“Why not just stop providing our area and stop robbing us customers from our hard earn money.Š— This company is a scam and should be put out of business once and for all."
"David of Mchenry, IL","Feb. 3, 2016",1,"And so, yesterday we could not access the On-Demand feature that is part of our tv service. Calling Comcast only got me a robot answer and then I waited... until I finally just hung up. Bottom line: could not watch anything on ""On-Demand"" and was not at all satisfied with this experience, especially since I've had to sit thru at least three complete outages in the past few weeks. Who knows how many more there were? I HATE Comcast!"
"Amanda of Henrico, VA","Feb. 3, 2016",1,"We moved to a place where Comcast is the only thing available right now. They reel you in with these packages. Well we have lived in three apartments in the complex. All the wiring is short. Try to get it fixed, ""well it's the apartment's problem. No it's the cable company's problem"". Well then they need approval from the apartment then get referred to the sales rep for the community. Still get nowhere and the never ending changes in bills, we get call to fix them and they're supposed credits get added on. Don't forget all the hidden fees you surprised with to get service in all the rooms and each box adds up. You can go pick up your boxes but never informed of that till they charged a lot of money to mail it. Then back to the wiring. It's so bad you have to have a tech come out and say it's free. Check the bill, 50.00 odd dollars in charges.Try to speak to customer service to work all this out, told we're wrong. They refuse to correct this bill. They're overcharging us 140.00 on this bill alone, taking the whole bill into consideration and we have to pay it cause our kid needs internet to do homework cause everything is online. They take and take with no account for who they affect. Bad, bad business practice. Shame on you money hungry people."
"Elsa of Peabody, MA","Feb. 3, 2016",1,"I changed a cable box from one bedroom to another. I called customer service to help reprogram the box. Well what a SURPRISE, they couldn't do it over the phone because they were incompatible. They send a representative over and then charge me a 38$ for coming to program a box! No notice on any fees just a charge. I call customer service. The rep. tries to tell me they changed a wire! Well my ** that happened, no wires changed! The representative basically called me a LIAR when I asked to speak to her manager and flat out refused! There has gotta be something we can do! Any suggestions?"
"Glenn of Maple Valley, WA","Feb. 2, 2016",1,"I went in to get support for my Comcast system which is a required feature Comcast promises under the contract signed with the service. I specifically instructed them NOT to sign me up for paper billing. I am an accountant and live by obtaining the receipts for the businesses I do work with. It is the only way to enforce contracts when breaches occur. I clicked on support and it brought me to a page that asks if I want to be signed up for paperless billing. It then gives you the option of signing out or accepting. There is no option whatsoever to refuse and still obtain online support. I contacted a third level manager and this manager promised I would not have to sign up for the paperless billing but then decided between the time I spoke with him and the time he promises to get back to me to sign me up for paperless billing then un-enroll me from paperless billing. I had instructed him I do not want to agree and do not agree yet they decided to go ahead and do so anyway. I went into my system again today and the same pop up came up stating I had to sign up or I would not be given support whatsoever. Do not trust this company. They are disreputable. It is unfortunate as I have enjoyed a long term (over a decade) relation with this company but now they are forcing their customers to sign up for paperless billing. Instead of stating to the customer that paper billing is more expensive and they can no longer afford, which is what I believe they are facing, to continue to send everyone paper billing they take away support if you won't agree to online billing. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY FOR ANYTHING in the future. The third level manager is still working on the problem."
"Ria of Huntsville, AL","Feb. 2, 2016",1,"I had internet set up with Comcast in my new apartment and before the technician left, he said that it may be a bit slow until it finished its updates. Not only was it slow, but it would not connect to my Roku at all (however, the wifi hotspot on my phone did without any issue or delay). In the midst of that, I had called inquiring about cable but decided that $137 was too steep for me and the internet service continued to decline in quality.I made between 6-8 calls to Comcast over the next 2 days attempting to resolve the issue. Twice the call was disconnected and I was not called back, once I was told that there would be a service charge between $25-50, once I was told there was nothing wrong with the unit (over the phone), once I was told that they would waive the fee (which was then $40, not the $25-50 the previous rep had said) and once I requested a supervisor's assistance to which I was told that all supervisors were in a meeting and one would call me back in 30 minutes - that also never happened.I finally got fed up with the whole thing and cancelled after 3 days and was told that I had to return the equipment to a UPS store to avoid being charged for it. The next day, I received a box with a security camera and a cable modem! I went online to my account, and guess who had added additional services to my account without my consent - COMCAST! I called and they tried to smooth it over by saying that the package was sent, but there was no plan set up for it on my account. ""Then why is it listed as a service on my online account page?"" I asked. I was told that they didn't know, but they didn't show it in their system. I cancelled my account and took all of their equipment back to UPS that day. I've never received such horrible service in my life - and I was only a customer for 3 days."
"Wallace of Port Matilda, PA","Feb. 2, 2016",1,"Just gotta love this. They expect us to pay our bills in a timely fashion for services rendered. TV service... never had a real issue that was not resolved immediately. Kudos for that. Internet however is another story. How the hell do you expect me to happily pay for internet service portion of my bill when I have averaged over 230 disconnects a week?? Some days are good... but most are atrocious. Equipment in the home swapped out several times and yet still constant disconnects. Do NOT tell me it's in the home. I don't buy it for a second. There is an issue outside the home, which numerous agents have admitted to seeing in my neighborhood.If I could only pay for the TV portion of my bill I would. I cannot see paying for internet service that makes dial-up look preferable. I am however paying the full bill since I have no other recourse. Get your crap together for crying out loud. 5 months of constant disconnects after all the in home equipment has been swapped out several times?? Logic dictates it is an outside issue causing the problems. But then again following logic implies intelligence... (disconnected while I was typing this... go figure.)"
"CR of Tucson, AZ","Feb. 2, 2016",1,"I wish we could give them 0 stars. When I first set up this account a year and a half ago, they set up two accounts in my name and attempted to bill me for two of the same service for four months. After many phone calls with them, it was finally resolved. I did really like their service after that and thought it had been an honest mistake with the initial account set up. Fast forward to less than two months ago: We moved a few miles away from our previous residence, and found out that Comcast Cable does not service the area. When I called to cancel my account, I was told at first that I needed to pay an early termination fee. I disputed this charge and after several phone calls and being bounced around to different departments, it had not been resolved. In the meantime, two weeks after we moved (one of those weeks was Christmas), they had already sent us to an informal collections for our equipment, tacked on an ""un-returned equipment fee"" and we were receiving several phone calls a day telling us to return the equipment. So then we went to the store and they gladly took the equipment, but then I was told that they ""don't have access to your billing account"" and they gave me the number for Comcast. I called Comcast in the Comcast store and was told to wait a week to call them back to confirm it had been resolved. A week later, I spoke with someone who told me that it was all taken care of and I was not responsible for the fee. A week later, I received another call from them again, attempting to collect the fee and they acted like it had not be resolved. I was able to ""resolve"" it on that call by speaking with an agent and this time, I insisted that I receive a confirmation number, ensuring me that termination fee had been removed from my account. When I checked my mail today, I had received a bill from Comcast for the fee as well as a Collections Notice from Credit Collection Services. Keep in mind that I returned their equipment when we went to the store two weeks after we moved. Also, we moved on Dec. 15th. It is now Feb. 1st, which means that while it took them forever to get my account set up right in the first place, they somehow managed to send me to informal collections for the equipment within 2 weeks and then to actual collections over a fee they should have never tried to collect, within 45 days. Maybe I should send them to collections for the hours and hours of my time they wasted when they first set my account up wrong and then billed me incorrectly when I closed it."
"Taurus of Douglasville, GA","Feb. 2, 2016",1,"For months I noticed increases in my bill, so I finally examined my bill to find that I was being charged usage fees for my data. I called to inquire and was told it would cost $10 a month, then when I agreed to the fee it was different, to have unlimited data is an extra $35 a month. So I am paying a $35 unlimited fee and additional $10/50GB additional usage fee. I called customer service to request an explanation and credit; representative told me she could not help me, and when I asked to be transferred to someone who could she hung up on me."
"Laura of Fall River, MA","Feb. 2, 2016",1,"I just called to reduce my bill and now Comcast has already increased two ""fees"" on the bill. I got no warning of the increases, and no explanation as to why these increased. Also with the new ""plans"" they offer, you have to pay for premium channels even though they are old movies and they run over and over. I don't want these channels but to get HD service, I have to go with this package and pay a higher price. It isn't fair and they are taking advantage because there is no competition in the area. I wish there was some competition in my area and I would switch in a heartbeat. This is not an isolated complaint, I have had to subscribe as I have no other choice. The bill is a different amount every other month and it never decreases. I am not getting anything better as a result either. Customer service is a joke. They just read from a script."
"C. of Three Rivers, MI","Feb. 1, 2016",1,"I have been paying for the Blast! Internet for over a year now but have never received the speeds that I have been paying for. Called in numerous times and nothing has ever been resolved. I had a technician come out and said the same thing that the speeds were way down and couldn't figure it out either. After many calls to Xfinity I FINALLY was given a $200 credit and decided not to switch to a different internet provider since they finally did something for my troubles. However, a supervisor looked over my account and felt I did not deserve the credit for paying for something I was not receiving and took my credit AWAY!! How can they give you a credit and then just remove it?! I just feel that is TERRIBLE customer service!"
"Patricia of Rego Park, NY","Jan. 31, 2016",1,"I have been with Comcast since Oct 2015. I did not have a choice unfortunately, in the apartment building I moved to. They do not know what they are doing. I had no phone service or voicemail for the 1st three weeks and absolutely no compensation for their error, people who came to transfer and set up the service after I moved to a new apartment in the same building did not complete the installation, and now I'm transferring to another apartment and instead of a transfer, they are calling me a new customer. They do not know what they are doing. I had to call the rapid response team to get my services fixed and report them to the FCC. They raise my rate when I have a written contract? They can't even place the correct television shows in their shabby menu. Comcast is pathetic. I have used TWC, FIOS, RCN and always had excellent service. If you can don't use these people. It's a horrible service where customer service does not communicate with each other, it's impossible to get a US Customer service, they mess up your modem online when you have to deal with the Philippines. OMG. It is such bad service. I wish I could get anything else but Comcast, but stuck with this horrible service."
"Lauren of Brick, NJ","Jan. 31, 2016",1,WORST COMPANY EVER! Aside from having the WORST customer service in the world they are crooks! After having the same channels for 5 years Comcast just decided to take channels away and then tried to charge for increasing your package to get them back. I work for a large company that has over 1500 apartments. Two of our locations in Ocean County have Comcast as their only option. Because this is the last straw with this company I have convinced the owners to now allow dishes. After 35 years of not allowing dishes as of Monday we will no longer suggest Comcast but will be persuading customers to get a dish instead. STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST!
"tariq of Magnolia, TX","Jan. 31, 2016",1,Recently I switched to Xfinity and could easily connect via VPN to my office. Recently I started having problem with my VPN Connection. When I contacted Xfinity they told me they do not guarantee VPN on residential networks. This is cheating. They did not tell me this when they were signing me up and it worked flawlessly for more than one month - the free cancellation period. Now I am being asked to pay additional to get an static IP and upgrade to business. If I cancel they want 210 $ from me. Is this fair in any way?
"anca of Port Charlotte, FL","Jan. 30, 2016",1,"This company is a complete disappointment! Their representatives are either not trained properly or their policy is overcharge customers and deal with the issues later. The bills are always changing from month to month, you are being told a price and when the bill comes you get another amount. From $ 114.98, as told, we were overcharged $222.74 and then $145.95. Everything is a lie and each representative puts the blame on somebody else and the cycle goes on forever. How can a person in the Philippines fix your issues when all they see is the same information I see on my bill? Comcast cannot afford to have qualified people to deal with issues? The service is not worth the outrageous fees they keep putting on consumers. There is no contract that states clearly the fees and the final prices you need to pay. This is how people give up Comcast and it will not stop here... I am just disgusted with this company and their billing policies... I will be another customer that will give up my cable with Comcast. You people have no ethics! You rip off hard earned money from people!!!"
Penny of WA,"Jan. 28, 2016",1,"I spent 2 1\2 hours flying around the world from South America, to the Philippines, to India. Fighting them to speak to an American in America. My on demand no longer worked because my boxes overnight became obsolete. They wanted me to drive to Comcast store. I told them that wasn't going to happen. I told them it was their problem that they can come to my house and fix it. I refuse to speak to anyone outside the United States. I finally got someone in Chicago who said they couldn't help me but another country could.I have had Comcast for years and have always had Americans in America answer my calls. You all should be disturbed that our account info, our social security numbers and credit numbers are all in foreign companies. I told them, ""write that I'm a racist, that you're taking jobs from Americans."" That Chicago lady tried telling me that those Philippians I was talking to were in Colorado. I said ""why are you lying to me?"" What, do they have them in a box somewhere as slave labor? I hate Comcast. They better fix my boxes and for free or the wrath of god is coming down on them."
"Rita of Jacksonville, FL","Jan. 28, 2016",1,"A Comcast salesperson talked us into a bundle package that included their basic security system. We were told that it was a three year contract but we were assured we could transfer it with us. My husband is a disabled Vietnam Veteran and we had to move out of our house to a condo. We are both retired and on a fixed income. When we were told that Comcast didn't service our new location and the fee was $720, I was shocked. I called the corporate headquarters and they refused to reduce the fee and was told someone would call me in 24 hours. When they didn't call, I called back and set up the time for termination and said I would file a complaint over the excessive termination fee. As soon as I hung up our service was terminated and it took two hours to get it hooked up again... They said it was a system glitch, I think it was done in retaliation."
"gil of Warminster, PA","Jan. 28, 2016",1,"We have ordered service from Comcast and signed a two year contract. At time of signing we were notified that we can cancel early and we will have to pay an early termination fee of $250.00, also that we can change any of the services such as downgrade or upgrade with no issues. As you know the market changes everyday and Verizon has offered us a deal we cannot refuse with no contract or obligation. I have called Comcast regardless the better deal from Verizon and explained that we no longer have televisions in the office and would like to just remove the Television service. Their response was I would have to pay early termination fee for the TV. Now I am starting to get upset so I asked worst case if I cancel everything what will be my early termination fee and guess what? It is $2100.00.I asked to show it to me that on the contract and the only thing they showed me is under termination fee on the contract there is a website address which you have to log into and that is where it explains that you have to pay 75% of your monthly bill X the remainder of the contract, in my case it is 17 months. I thought it was bogus so I decided to call Sarah ** who was my inside rep and was the sweetest customer rep I have ever spoke to at time of purchase. Now her answers to my question about termination fee is: ""I have checked the system and did not see a record of conversation with you today"", after I called twice. I was not looking for a conversation times or specific posting, just looking for a simple answer ""what is my early termination fee"". I can pull hair out of my teeth and still get no answer, completely being ignored by customer service. Beware, the contract and the promises is a total scam and false promises. Read the terms and condition. The funny thing that makes me very concern is how do I know when is the terms and conditions were changed they were never presented to me in writing and a $250.00 early termination was promised which is a total bogus. Stay away. The worst customer service ever."
"Mil of Knoxville, TN","Jan. 27, 2016",1,"3 different installers attempted to do install, but could not because service line from road to house needed to be replaced. The 3rd installer who described the reason it would take an additional week to obtain my long-standing phone number from my present provider indicated that the work order was to connect one (1) TV; I have five (5). Due to the increase of TVs, the work order and contract were invalid as well as the monthly rate I had been quoted. The monthly rate would increase substantially. Was this a ""bait & switch"" tactic? What is the competence of maintenance to restore the line prior to having an installer arrive? I cancelled several appointments to be present for the installers. Due to the nature of robocalls used to schedule the installers, I could not state the problem of a ""non-serviceable line."" I have reported this complaint to the FCC."

Last month when I tried to obtain services, I was told that the apartment had a $400 dollars debt. The apartment was leased through August 2015. The contract for COMCAST services was between the tenant and COMCAST. I was not even aware that the tenants had COMCAST services. I was told that the debt was associated to the apartment rather than the tenants. This cannot be legal. An apartment cannot enter into a contract, only individuals can. Resolution expected from COMCAST: Remove the debt from the apartment. "
"Lynette of Jacksonville, FL","Jan. 27, 2016",1,I set up an account on 1-19-16 for services X1 Xfinity & Home Security Instructing them that a Bucket Truck was required to do the job! They sent a tech out on 1-21-16 in a van with a ladder. His supervisor come out to survey the situation and said the cable needed to be ran over 350 feet. & Comcast has to do it not a contractor. The supervisor told me someone with a bucket truck would be out within 24 - 48 hrs. No one showed up until 1-26-16 in a truck with a ladder. He told Comcast they had to come with a bucket truck.

"Terry of Houston, TX","Jan. 28, 2016",1,"The day after this experience, I received a call from Comcast and they restored my ability to use credit cards.  There is still hope yet for this internet provider Giant!Original ReviewThis is probably one of the worst companies I have ever had to deal with. In order to keep my services I had to give them a credit card number that would withdraw my funds a week later. The week passed and they made an attempt to withdraw. By the time this happened, a charge hit my card that I wasn't aware of. So they were not able to make the withdrawal. I called them to try to use another card and was told that I would not be able to use another credit card, claiming that there was fraud on my account. They said that I would need to call my bank to get that cleared up. I got my bank on the line and did a 3-way call with Comcast. Then their story changed. They said that they had run my credit and since my score was low, I wouldn't be able to use a card again. I have never had a problem with any other company in the past. Usually if one card doesn't work, the merchant will just ask for another one. Not Comcast! I am now placed on a 6-month ban for using a credit card. Most of the agents, including supervisors were rude and could care less whether I was a customer or not. When I told them that they were losing a customer, they told me to make sure and turn in my boxes. I am disgusted. I am sure that most people at some point in their lives have had a credit card that was declined. Unless you are well off, in which case you probably couldn't relate. This company is unreasonable and does not know how to treat loyal customers. I am going to be seeking internet service elsewhere now..."

According to Comcast our Nov. billing was not received until 01/12/16, I wrote and mailed the payment of $64.98 on 12/28/15. So we called Comcast to straighten the mess out. The customer service rep who took our call was rude and accusatory. He told us that the late charge of $14.50 will remain on the bill and we have to pay it and take the matter to our postal service. I was appalled by his comments. I requested to speak to another person.After 10 minutes of holding, another person (a woman) who spoke to us that resembled a script from a movie, was a little bit helpful. And after pulling our history with Comcast (since 1999, yeah, I was stunned to discover I have remained a loyal diligent paying customer ever since and this is the service I got from them in return, I kicked myself, I am stupid for being a Comcast customer), to make a long story short, I handed the phone to my husband and he waited patiently as the customer service rep waived the late fee and other charges that they added onto the bill, while I called other cable and internet providers."

Do not sign up for the Triple Play and think you are to get a gift card, if so don't be late because you will never receive it. Poor customer service, will not be using them anymore after my 12 months is done. Choose a better provider when choosing your cable service. But the supervisor did offer free premium channels for a month and I decline because that wasn't a good deal to take despite I work all the time."
"cee of Palm Beach, FL","Jan. 25, 2016",1,"My experience dating back to sept 2015 when I had to use them due to my new residence not using AT&T. They rake you over the coals with costs so I used the self install kits. My TV box didn't work. They sent a technician and he informed me it was the wrong remote control. Hilarious right? He made a note of such and I called while he was there to inform xfinity I would not be charged for the service call due to faulty equipment. They charged me $70. It took 14 phone calls (yes, literally) and 3 months to get that charge off my bill (whilst they threatened to cut my service). The cable is good. The internet. I work remotely for an insurance company so had to pay extra for 105 mbps. The internet goes out so frequently it is laughable. My IT people created a graph showing the activity on my PC through xfinity. Xfinity would not let me email it to any techs. Instead they said (get this) it might be the equipment and that they could come out since my upload and download speeds are below 50 mbps. BUT if its with the house they will bill me for service call. The internet worked well the first month, very fast and since has gotten slower and slower logging me off my work system throughout the day. I have spend many a day on the phone with xfinity ""troubleshooting"". I have great difficulty communicating with the support staff due to language barriers. But what basically happens is they remotely reset my modem or tell me to unplug then plug back in. On December 16 there was NO service during the day. I called and they said that the outage was due to maintenance and would be back on at 8pm!!! They said they would prorate my bill for that day... They did not... I hung up today after 20 minutes. In my 45 years of being alive and in my 20 years of dealing with companies, government entities and quality management I have never dealt with such an unprofessional and awful company and product. Fee after fees.. the runaround... and then nothing to show for your hours on the phone with them. This is how they become so wealthy... People give up and let the big company just straddle them up."
"John of Tupelo, MS","Jan. 25, 2016",1,"Comcast installers apparently dug a trench in my backyard when no one was home and ran a new underground cable under my driveway to my house. The cover was taken off the distribution box on the wall and left on the ground. Several large coils of the connected orange coax cable were left against my house next to my door and at the pole at the rear of my lot, none of which were connected to anything. I now have 2 runs of the orange coax that are not connected to anything.I have never had Comcast service at this location and did not order the service. My guess is that the installers came to the wrong address, dug and ran the cable, then took off when they realized their mistake. No notes, no calls, nothing from Comcast. I called Comcast on Jan. 13, 2016 and explained the situation. I was promised a call from a supervisor by 10:15 am on Jan. 14 and repair by 10:25 on Jan. 15. I received no response. I called back on Jan. 20 and was promised a call from a supervisor and corrective action within 24-48 hours. I'm still waiting..."
"Susie of Pasadena, TX","Jan. 25, 2016",1,"Comcast has to be the worst! I called to remove two features off of my account which was Digital Preferred, (because the price I pay isn't worth the channels I catch) and Sports Entertainment package. I was offered a package with the same cable service I had (Digital Starter) & faster internet w/1 year contract, for less than what I've been paying. I stressed several times I only called to remove those two features, because I needed to have certain channels (ex. Disney)! Being that I was assured my channels would remain the same, I decided to take advantage of the feature I was offered. Well, how I'm not surprised!! Changes took effect today. What's missing??? Disney channel, along with almost every other channel I had previously! So, I call, to get what I agreed to! Of course, the rep, could not help me, besides telling me I now have basic cable (which was obvious by this point, but, again, not what I asked for neither agreed to). After demanding I get what I was offered and agreed to, the customer rep placed me on hold, until 5:02 PM then transferred me back into the call queue, at which point the automated system indicated that the office was now closed (on a Sunday)! HOW DISRESPECTFUL AND UNPROFESSIONAL!!! I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND COMCAST TO ANYONE!!!"
"Jennifer of Philadelphia, PA","Jan. 24, 2016",1,"I had an appointment scheduled with Comcast to come out and hook up my internet service. The day of the appointment no one called or showed up within the allotted time frame. I called, and they couldn't understand why no one called or showed up so they rescheduled my appointment for a later slot on the same day. The time came and went, still no call/no show. Called again to try and get some answers and was instructed that they could reschedule me for 1 week from then. After refusing and speaking to a supervisor he ensured me someone would be out the next day to take care of everything. Next day appointment time came and went. Called to inquire AGAIN and they said I never had an appointment and rescheduled me for 4 days later. This company is a joke. The woman I spoke to gave me constant attitude as if I was somehow ruining her day for them not showing up. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she proceeded to keep talking and ignore me until I screamed supervisor in her ear. She puts me on hold, comes back on and pretends to be the supervisor!!! I immediately demanded she transfer me to someone else. Still have no internet that I've been paying for and they could absolutely care less."
"Linda of Roswell, GA","Jan. 24, 2016",1,New customer today. Installed today Saturday. A few hours later no signal. 50 minutes on phone. I was told Comcast is unable to reset boxes and will need to send a technician. 5 DAY WAIT. EARLIEST someone can come out is next Wednesday. Shame on Comcast. And I was charged for the installation.
"Dari of Palm Beach Gardens, FL","Jan. 23, 2016",1,"On 12/5/15 I ordered service, the installer came and could not install (said need stronger signal) and said they would have to come back. Instead of fixing the signal strength and coming back to install, they canceled the order. Re-ordered on 1/15/16 and ordered self-installation and the equipment never came. Called again on 1/22/16 and was told there was no order in the system. Have called 3 times today 1/23/16 and they keep transferring to different people and then I get disconnected. HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO PLACE AN ORDER!!! I have spent at least 5 hours on hold over the past month and missed a whole day of work meeting the installer. Unbelievable!!! Now I know why I have AT&T, but I am trying to save money since my community provides basic cable."
"Jorge of Fort Lauderdale, FL","Jan. 23, 2016",1,"Exactly one week ago I signed up to receive TV, Internet & phone services with Comcast. The sales rep Adam gave me appointment for yesterday, Friday, January 22, 2016 between 1-3 PM for the installation. A black technician with poor English came at 2 PM and after three hours he was unable to locate the cables and therefore the service was not installed. He then told me that he spoke to his supervisor and scheduled another appointment for today, January 23, 2016 between 8-10 AM. They never showed up. It is now 1:15 PM. I have called three times and they keep telling me that they will show up. I cancelled my round of golf and RESCHEDULED ALL MY ACTIVITIES ONLY TO FEEL KIDNAPPED BY COMCAST TECHNICIANS. That is unacceptable. Normally I will cancel services but I cannot because the HOA of my community gave COMCAST the rights to provide these services. Please if you can help it stay away from COMCAST."
"Mark of Madison, VA","Jan. 21, 2016",1,Comcast just does not care about anything but raising your rates. Customers are leaving them in droves. Former support managers confirm this. I spend 4 days working at the local and HQ level customer support on a large number of issues that they never solved. I got most of my issues solve in 1/2 hour with my paid for support. Now they are holding up switching my original number to a new carrier. I asked to speak several times via phone or e-mail with Senior VP in frustration offering to highlight my service issues and help them improve. To this date no reply. I have sent and received well over 2 dozen e-mails and have talked at least that many people without any resolution. Dump COMCAST!
"Barb of Raytown, MO","Jan. 20, 2016",1,"I want to know why Comcast says ""for English press #1"". Funny I never get a person who speaks fluent English. We pay our bill on time every month as expected, BUT I have to struggle to understand the people they say speaks English. Sorry it's not ENGLISH!!! Please get people who speak English for people like me!!!! I wonder if I push 'Spanish' if it would be easier to understand? I may try that!!!"
"Debra of Middleburg, FL","Jan. 19, 2016",2,"It seems that Comcast can raise rates for services on a sidetrack while I'm locked in a two-year contract for a double play at 99.99... My bill is now 128.24 while I've only upgraded one service, which is the internet speed. They can slip in a ""broadcast fee"" for whatever they please and we're stuck paying it until the contract has expired, and in my case that is 14 months from now. The fee were raised 5 dollars per month in just one month. Looks like this is going to be a long 14 months. I really think this is a sneaky way of tacking on fee while still be able to keep a person locked in a contract. Before anyone says that I should ""read"" the contract before agreeing, my husband was the one that agreed to it and now he's out of the picture. NOT ONLY that, but if I move in with another person who already has Comcast, I'm still stuck paying the termination fees."
"Cheryl of Westfield, MA","Jan. 19, 2016",1,This was the second time I had to call as they don't change the programming like they say they are going to. I would not even have Comcast but the apartment complex I live in won't let us have DirecTV. 4 more months of living here till our lease is up. Then we will have DirecTV again. Comcast sucks.
"Jon of Aurora, CO","Jan. 19, 2016",1,The service is out more than 50% of the time in Denver and is the only high speed internet provider in this regional monopoly.
"Cesar of Tamarac, FL","Jan. 18, 2016",1,"Called Comcast regarding new service on 01/15/2017. The reason for my call was regarding a package which was promoted on their website regarding X1 Triple Play for 159.99 with a 2 yr contract or 169.99 without contract. I was mostly interested in the package for the internet speed which was 150mbps. I was not able to get the package due to my HOA which includes certain packages within bulk accounts. The representative sold me a package for $119.99 which included the promotion regarding the Triple Play and DVR was suppose to be included, TV Latino, and all additional channels.Two days later I received an email that my package is now $149.99 which has additional items needed to be paid separately. Always ask if the DVR, additional outlets, modem, are included within the package. Please make sure like I did to record your conversations, dates, times and names with every representative you speak too. I recorded my conversation which clearly the sales representative is lying regarding the options included and how much I will pay per month. I just contacted Comcast and I am suppose to receive a call back regarding the call with a solution within 48 hrs. I will report them to BBB, and the Federal Trade Commission pertaining their practices and if nothing is resolved I will hire an attorney. Be very aware of Comcast. They are the worst with over 4,000 reports."
"Tammy of Murfreesboro, TN","Jan. 18, 2016",1,"How about submitting our complaints together to https://www.fcc.gov/ or other American government departments eg. White House? More complaints submitted to the higher officials, American government should pay attention to this. We suffered the same experiences by Comcast. They betray their promises, cheat customers, raise and charge their fees unreasonably. It is NO USE to contact with Comcast Customer Service. We wonder how this kind of company without business credit can be existing. It ranks within 500 richest companies in the world. Lots of money is robbed from customers."
"kingdra of Atlanta, GA","Jan. 18, 2016",1,"I have been trying to get Xfinity-Comcast in my home off and on for over 2 years. I just give up! I have scheduled an appointment to have service installed a few times. The install never happens!! The first time a tech comes out and I'm told it can't be done. I contacted customer service and I'm given the run around of being told someone would contact me soon. Never happens! Finally, I'm able to talk to a supervisor after numerous attempts; whom apologize and states the issue will be resolved. He told me someone would contact me to reschedule. That never happened. After a few days still no response. I gave up and decided to go with Dish. Maybe about a week later of my bad experience, my neighbor right next door gets cable! I'm confused and pissed! So now my contract ended with Dish I decide to give Xfinity another try. The same issue! The tech explains he is not experienced enough to install my cable. What?! He apologizes and explain a more experienced tech will come out by Sunday and someone will contact me for installation. Again no one has shown up. I called customer service only to be given the run around again. Someone help me understand this. I'm in the city where there are poles and wires everywhere you turn. Also, my neighbor that is literally 5 feet away from my house has Comcast. He stated there was no problem getting service. A friend of mine who is a tech for Xfinity came by to see if the tech could have done the install. He also agreed the tech could have done my install. I'm just disappointed that a popular cable company has such poor customer service and professionalism. I would not recommend trying to install Xfinity-Comcast to anyone. This is ridiculous. I really expected more from such a well know cable company."
"Jerry of Fl, FL","Jan. 17, 2016",1,"Comcast is the consummate automated company where computer programs run the company and the people that work for it are useless. I was an internet customer for about 8 years when I decided to let them have my TV business and switched to the triple play when I moved on November 4th. Even though they were supposed to install me on the fifth my nightmare began learning the day before that they could not install me before December. I would never have changed my TV services to them if I knew that because I run my business with their internet services and I would surely be out of business if I were shut down for 30 days.I threatened to sue and started receiving action, finally promised installation of basic services for the internet by November 8th. The serviceman who came that day told me he couldn't install me and when I threatened to call his supervisor he began ripping up my walls looking for cable. He spent three hours here, did damage to the house and installed everything incorrectly. I put in a ticket for damages that has never been acted upon, even though I complained about it for separate times.The second service call the installation department advised me that due to the inconvenience they waived my installation fee. Because there was a wait I made crude connections to at least give me internet services, but experienced frequent outages because the wrong equipment was installed. On the second service call, a third was scheduled for the TV in all four rooms.They missed the third and fourth service calls and each missed appointment even with accelerated rescheduling you wait four or five days. Well to limit this to an amount that can be read on the eighth call they finally installed my TV services. But I still do not have the third part of Triple play three months later. I received my third bill on January 8th and noticed there was a second bill never sent. I learned that their automated service billed me three times for the same installation even though I was promised on the second call it would be free and noticed that none of the seven promised $20 credits were given. They have me owing them $750 for two months of service. I paid the first bill promptly.I can document speaking with five supervisors. They each acknowledge what was done wrong and that I was entitled to relief and each promised to make it right. But apparently Comcast strips supervisors of any meaningful authority and their automated billing system takes over. They never even sent me a complaint form for any of the problems I experienced. They just provide ticket numbers and no one has authority to do anything.I contacted a lawyer and intend to follow up with a complaint to Congress. Congress should look into them as possibly violating monopoly protections because they use their money and influence to steal business from competitors, where they don't honor the inducements. Unless you enjoy aggravation you should steer clear of Comcast Cable."
"charley of Grayslake, IL","Jan. 17, 2016",1,"I signed up for one year new internet service deal with the Comcast/Xfinity for $39.99 last November so I got the paperless bill for next following two months for $39.99/month. However, Comcast sent me the bill through mail and charged me $44.99. My bill is supposed to be $39.99/month for one year which means until this year November. That's the deal what I saw online and that's the deal what the customer representative signed me up for. I was not sure why they increased the bill by five dollars so I called and talked to one of representative. However, this representative did not what the heck she was talking about and I don't think she even had a clue why the bill increased by five dollars. She kept saying $44.99 is still a promotion value for same internet speed over and over again. But $44.99 is NOT what I signed up for!! I told her to let me talk to supervisor but she told me supervisor was busy. Well, I'm a busy person, too. Does she think I like talking to her for more than an hour? I was supposed to get a call from supervisor within two hours but it has been more than a day, and I still haven't got a call yet. Xfinity internet speed is faster and better than other but they have the WORST customer service."
"Monica of Chicago, IL","Jan. 16, 2016",1,"I was a customer with Comcast for a little over two years. It has been the worst experience of my life!! They upgraded my account without my consent. After I insisted on going back to my original plan the nightmare began. My services were interrupted until I paid them the past due amount (which was because of the upgrade). I agreed to pay because they said if I paid they would reimburse me and bring my account current with my original rate. After I paid 200 dollars, nothing was changed or credited!I spoke with a few managers and other staff. They wanted me to pay another 199 to bring my account current claiming again that they would reimbursement me the charges that were put on my account because of the upgrade, which I never asked for. I refused to do it again because at this point they are scamming me! Now they have send me to collections and there is NOTHING I can do about it. I am so upset! I will not pay for someone else's mistake. Who can be held accountable for this? This means Comcast can take advantage of people and get away with it???"
"Lauren of Chatham , IL","Jan. 16, 2016",1,"We recently moved into a new home and wanted cable, Internet, and home security.

"Kyle of Baytown, TX","Jan. 16, 2016",1,"Called in Oct 2015 to inquire about a prepaid card promotion. The agent wasn't sure why I hadn't received the card yet. Gave me a ref #. Called back in 2 weeks for status, card still hadn't shipped, said I hadn't completed an agreement. Completed agreement and was told 1-2 wks to get card. Never got it. Called CS again and was told it takes 3-4 weeks and call back in 2 weeks. Called back and they tried telling me to call the reward center, which was currently closed, so I refused and asked to speak to a supervisor. Finally got one and he didn't know why I hadn't got it yet either. He offered a $100 credit which I accepted, but wasn't satisfied. Asked if he could guarantee I still receive the card and he said no. So I plan on continuing to pursue this until I get the card that I was promised. In the meantime, I plan on terminating my contract and switch providers based on this experience."
"Andrea of Cape Coral, FL","Jan. 14, 2016",1,"Since the day I got Comcast has been a headache. Got the package of cable and Internet $79.99 in September. They said the installation was free. Got two bills in sept. The 1st one for $164 and on sept 27th for $79.19 so my first month was for $243.49. Besides the installation was bad. Since the day I got they wanted me to charge a technician fee of $39.99. I decide not to pay it because they did the connection bad. After several calls they accept not to charge me. Then again my cable was not working. I call several times two hours on the phone. Again they want me to charge for a third technician to come to my house due to ""the old box of cable"". I got (weeks with no cable) until November that I decide to disconnect the cable because was giving me too much problems.Had been waiting since sept to adjust my bills and accounts and finally now in Jan the 8th I got rid of my internet connections. They keep telling me to pay all the excessive charges that I was not willing to pay. Have went to the store many times and call and until now they can't get the adjustments right. They are charging me $79.99 more that still I'm not willing to pay. This company in Cape Coral doesn't work right. Still fighting for it. Such a waste of time and bad flavor."
"Glenda of Atlanta, GA","Jan. 14, 2016",1,"I signed up for a TV service promo back in May 2015. The promo was suppose to be good for 1 year. Then back in July 2015 I bundled my service by adding internet. The bundle promo price was $49.99 plus equipment leasing fees, taxes, etc... and the promo price was suppose to be good for 1 year. However in December 2015 I was taken out of my promo bundle price and charged $20 more, then in January I was charged $30 more.When I called in with my concerns about my bill I was told at first by a manager that he was going to have my info sent to the department that could fix my problem by that department entering in the correct codes that would put me back in my promo that hadn't expired on my account yet and I would be contacted by email when the problem was fixed. I in turned stated I would pay my bill as soon as the problem was fixed.I checked my balance every couple of days and the balance remained the same until I checked yesterday 01/13/16 the balance was now more than doubled. I called in and was althoughly told Xfinity/Comcast is not offering that promo anymore so if I wanted to keep my current service I would have to pay the new price or choose another promo that would result in me losing some of my services at around the same price or I would have to upgrade and pay more. This not good business, they are currently offer all types of promos on their website right now that says good for 1 year when that is not true. They should put the price is subject to change whenever."

"Heike of Naples, FL","Jan. 13, 2016",1,"Comcast is unbelievable in how easily and continuously they raise their prices. I have been with them for a little over 3 years now, and every year they raise their price 20-30%. They have a monopoly and can do whatever they want. It is unbelievable!"
"Parker of Albuquerque, NM","Jan. 13, 2016",1,"I was about 10 days late paying my latest bill when I received a call from Comcast. I told the agent that I would be able to pay within a few days. The agent asked me for my debit card number so that they could charge the amount at that time. I agreed and gave her my number. A week later, I noticed that not only had Comcast deducted the amount I owed, but they went ahead and charged my card for the upcoming charge which would not have been due to them for another 3 weeks. I called Comcast and explained the situation. I spoke with an agent named Angela. She apologized profusely and told me that it was their policy to always verify the amount before any charges would be processed and a refund had been authorized. After 5 days no refund. Called Comcast to find that no refund was being processed and I was forced to call my bank and institute a fraud investigation. I also asked my bank to disallow Comcast from making any further charges on my debit card account."
"Kaydia of Baltimore, MD","Jan. 13, 2016",1,"This has been the worst experience ever. Every day there is something wrong with the Internet or TV. You cannot have a peaceful day watching TV and be happy. Then when the entire community was out of internet they send an tech to your house but have the nerve of charging you when it's their fault, not to mention every month the bill goes up. I would never recommend this company to anyone and with that said I will go to your competition."
"Jean of North Lauderdale, FL","Jan. 12, 2016",1,"Am currently on the phone with one of your representatives 8:25pm or so. This call began with her but prior I was on the line for over an hour and a half. I spoke with a gentleman who transferred me after I initially called to disconnect services stating his part of customer service does not disconnect. So many departments so little service. After being transferred Tasha picks up your line it take 20 minutes as she would not disconnect the services after being repeatedly asked to. She kept telling us about different services, we declined. I became very upset as she started to speak over me. I handed my daughter the phone because Tasha refused to listen as she continued about phone services which if I am calling to cancel services I do not need. She chuckled throughout the call. I have had experiences with your customer service but nothing like this. I would have stayed a customer just a while longer but Tasha definitely sealed the deal. Hopefully something will be done regarding this party maybe speaking with her but I'm very sure she would cause your business to lose more and more each day unless retrained. She advised me when asked that they are not required to give their employee identification number as I understood but she did advise which I hope she was honest about that her Location was in Mississippi. Please contact me at ** as this was my number linked to my account with your company. She also put in a ticket number for a box I did not have but she said has been on my account as ""free"" of monthly charges. I have only had one television one tiny little box for cable so I'm not sure how this appeared on my account. I'm just completely dissatisfied with your service and your customer service is simply awful, disrespectful and it's not actually service, it's a blatant disrespect for your customer. But I guess if you're as big as your company is who would care how your customers are treated? It's simply about the money. My ending balance as of today per automated system and Tasha was 175.10. I will pay this and be overjoyed to never have to contact your company again as this was the worst experience ever. I will make sure to advise others that I haven't spoken to who already are disgusted with your service that they should stay away. Verizon and Xfinity/Comcast became the worst merger especially regarding their customer service. Thank you for reading. I'm sure your company will never answer but at least I sent it by email and posted it to Google"
"Max of Ft Myers, FL","Jan. 12, 2016",1,Comcast canceled the TV guide channel 96. What a cheap ass company! Now you have to upgrade to a more expensive TV package just to get the TV guide channel. Plan to dump Comcast.
"HARRIET of Baltimore, MD","Jan. 12, 2016",1,"I inquired about the promotional service they offered in Aug 2015 the bundle for 89.99 for 2 yr contract and 1 yr free DVR service. When I called and place my order the customer service agent assured me there was no installation fee, due that we were already wired to receive cable from previous customer. It was just matter of putting in our cable box and connecting us. I asked how much my monthly bill would be and she quoted ""No charges for installation."" So my bill would approximately be 89.99 plus taxes and fees bring total $114. approx. Before a month pass I got a bill for over $300.00. I could not believe and I knew they had made a mistake. I contacted them via phone. After finally being connected to a live person after they ask you several times how may they assist you, they told me they made a mistake and billed for installation which I should not have been charge for after we discussed no charges would be applied. They promise and gave me a credit installment receipt reference # and the charges would be credited back and taken off my account. I received the next bill and the charges were higher amount, was over $400.00. I was totally shocked and disappointed as they never removed or credit my account of installment charges as agreed upon. When I call to inquire I spoke to an agent in billing. We got nowhere as she had no idea what I was talking about when I provided her with the credit ticket # they provided to me. I was told they gave me the wrong ticket # and they would have submit another one. This went on for 4 months still with no resolution even after being transfer to the customer resolution dept. As of now I just received another bill for over $500. They had told me they would send me a revised bill with the correct amount due back in Oct 2015. Never received it. Very bad business. A consumer's worse nightmare."
"Angelique of Flat Rock, MI","Jan. 11, 2016",1,"I called Comcast/Xfinity after receiving my bill bc they OVERCHARGED me $131.04 for equipment & service I don't have. Also Comcast NEVER issued 3 credits I was promised: $20 tech no show credit, $90 bc my cable box was faulty & my service was out almost 2 months & $50 bc I went to cancel service with them. Nothing but empty resolutions, not one of those credits were issued... Don't trust Comcast (non) service reps when they promise a credit; They just want to get you off the phone! To top it off my services still doesn't work after 3 techs have been out. Skip the hour long hassle with tech support bc they never fix anything... COMCAST XFINITY is a horrible company that obviously doesn't have any training standards. The best part is I told them I wanted to email them my phone bill so they could see that I have been on the phone with them over 14 hours in 3 months but they had the NERVE to tell me they are not equipped with email... haha, probably bc they can't get their internet to work. So many people complain about their TERRIBLE SERVICE, TECHNICAL SUPPORT, BILLING ERRORS & EQUIPMENT FAILS. It shows that Comcast is just a scam company that does not put anything back into their business & continuously deceives their customers. Questioning why I trusted their Xfinity lies & went back to them; Switching back to DirecTV."

Most recently (ongoing since July 2015), I have spent at least 3-4 hours on either live-chat or phone trying to resolve a string of issues: Bill goes up; I e-mail or call; they tell me my promotion has expired, but they will offer a different promotion and say they will adjust my bill accordingly. When my next bill comes, it has not been adjusted. I call again; they deny that they made any deal. Initially I always used live chat because then I would have a transcript of what I was told. But in December 2015, the live chat representative told me he could not help me and I would have to call. So I called. (Incidentally, the person that I then talked to told me that the live chat agents weren't very good and that it is better to call.)The person I talked to verified that my bill would be $129.99 per month for a bundle plus $10 modem fee plus taxes. She stated that I would not be charged for DVR rental; she also told me that I should pay $169.12 (rather than the charge on my bill of $179.12) and that the bill would be adjusted in January. In January, I was charged for the difference between those two amounts plus the DVR rental. When I called, I was told that there was no record of the promises that the agent in December had made. My word against hers. I asked for the contact information for the ""higher up"" in the Company who is in charge of customer service and was told that the only thing I could do would be to go to the nearest Comcast store and ask to speak to the manager. These run-arounds are getting to be so aggravating and time consuming."
"Mike of Glen Mills, PA","Jan. 8, 2016",1,I won't get into the numerous service issues and outages. But why is a technology company's website so slow? This is what happens when you allow monopolies.
"Brad of White Lake, MI","Jan. 7, 2016",1,"1.5.16 - I visited a Comcast Service Center in Hartland, MI in an effort to exchange a suspected poor performing Modem. It had no range to pick up WIFI across the house. (Side note and History) A year ago, Comcast sent me numerous pieces of marketing trash about how great the new NO charge modem. I finally broke down and ordered the unit. Comcast, lost the order so had to reorder a month later. Over the course of a day or two I made 5 calls to Comcast customer service to activate this unit only to become extremely disappointed but finally got it activated. (Back to 1.5.16) The desk agent suggested that the latest model of modem has the dual band and would definitely provide more range. I was satisfied with this answer and moved on to the next subject of charges. Periodically, my bill goes up $10-$20 and provides the same lame service. The agent lowered my bill $40 per month and upgraded me to another plan and gave me a couple of more channels, but this required replacement of the DVR. I thought Wow, maybe Comcast has really changed... until I got home and tried to get service activated. I called the activation number and spoke to a person who was practicing English and after 45 minutes on the line still had no service. I called back and spoke with another agent who had better English and after 49 minutes was able to get internet service only. I learned from this person that she would have to schedule a technician to come out to the house and activate the cable for the TV the following day. The tech arrived and learned that the DVR was defective and quickly replaced the box with a new one. I like the new box and the high tech remote, but still have poor performing internet modem. I absolutely refuse to call Comcast back and try to get someone to understand what I need. At the earliest opportunity I can find another provider who can meet my needs I am moving on. I promise."
"Kevin of Trenton, NJ","Jan. 7, 2016",1,Dvr box freezes and I've already received my 3rd bill after only one month of service. I feel like throwing this stupid x1 box out of my apartment window. I hate it. It's a ripoff... My bill is 170.00 a month for garbage cable service and no premium channels. I miss Cablevision. It was so much better.
"p. of Los Alamos, NM","Jan. 6, 2016",1,"he said it was all set up and asked for a US100 deposit which I provided with a credit card number. Was given an ID number for new account setup. January 5 AM: A different Comcast rep calls to say why we now had two accounts. When I explained she said the guy last night didn't know what he was doing. (I suspected that, and not just because of his broken English.) After about 20 minutes this rep said we could proceed with the new account as planned but would have to speak to my wife, since the new account would be in her name. January 5 PM: Called Comcast with ID number for new account but he said we first had to return the current equipment we rent from Comcast and then set up an appointment for a technician to come and install new equipment for the new account. Seemed illogical to me--why couldn't a tech come and take the old equipment and install the new? This guy was so off-putting that I hung up and called again to get a different rep. January 5 PM: The rep this time was a native English-speaking young woman who seemed to know what she was doing. She said of course we didn't need to return the old equipment ourselves and she didn't even need to speak to my wife. She gave an order number for a tech to come the following morning between 10:00 and 12:00. January 6 AM: No word from Comcast or a tech so I called Comcast again. This woman rep, in barely understandable English, said there was no order number. After 30 minutes I gave up waiting for her to keep checking and hung up. January 6 AM: Called again and spoke to a native English-speaking woman who was very helpful. Said there was indeed such an order and that a tech should appear between 10:00 and 12:00 AM. She also spoke to my wife and got authorization from my wife to allow me to deal now and in future with any issues with the new account in my wife's name. Again provided credit card info for US100 deposit for the new account. January 6 AM: Tech appeared and set up new equipment and everything went well. He said there are a lot of complaints about the Comcast service provided by phone reps. January 6 AM: Saw the new bill Comcast emailed. It listed services I explicitly declined! My bill now would be about the same as it was with the old account! January 6 AM: Called Comcast about the bill and was told they would have to speak to my wife about it because I was not authorized as an account holder! I'll be calling back this evening when my wife is available. So I've spent about 5 hours just talking to phone reps and getting very angry and stressed over the conflicting information about equipment change, authorization, etc. The ""old"" equipment was working just fine--why did we have to get new modem and TV boxes just because the new account is under a different name? My advice to anyone dealing with Comcast phone reps is to hang up immediately if you reach someone with a foreign accent and keep calling back until you have better luck and reach an actual American with no accent! I would very gladly drop Comcast if there were comparable service in my area."
"sharon of Fort Lauderdale, FL","Jan. 5, 2016",1,"Comcast is out of control with their prices! My promotion will be ending on 1/15. I called to get another promotion considering I am on a budget I wanted to be in the same area of monies. I was told they have no promotion at this time. Right now I have internet and basic cable paying 69$ a month that will go to 90$. Remind you 25 stations 6 to 8 Spanish, nothing against Spanish just don't speak it, for 90$. Sat on phone for hour for nothing. Poor customer service!!!"
"Felicia of Gaithersburg, MD","Jan. 5, 2016",1,"There was a Comcast service outage in my area for over 3 months. Comcast fixed the issues and adjusted my bill to $97 for the issue. They gave me an HD box, which I did not ask for, and they told me it was a ""gift"" for the fact that I went without service for so long. I never changed my service or ordered anything extra. Over the past three months my bill has jumped to $200, 106% increase! I asked for my services to be disconnected. I contacted Comcast and they refuse to fix this. I spoke to Everett and Emanuel in customer service and they said I have to wait 10 days to cancel my service, and I am not in a contract. I contacted Comcast to return the equipment but they make me wait either by them picking it up (4 days) or mailing it back (5-7 days), yet I am still being billed. I spoke to Everett and Emanuel in customer solutions and Stanley and Richard (floor supervisor) in equipment recovery. I also contacted Darlene ** several times. She is who originally gave me the fixed price for the fact that I went without service for so long. I have never been late or missed payment to Comcast in over 2 years. Now all I want is for my services to be disconnected and they refuse to do so. I can provide written documentation for everything as well. They are only doing this because they know my area doesn't have any other service provider. I am a student. I don't need cable but I do need internet and they will not fix my bill."
"DIANE of Lansing, MI","Jan. 4, 2016",1,"This is the worst company I have ever had the displeasure to deal with! I warn anyone considering Comcast... Don't do it! You will be pushed to the limits of your humanity! I cancelled this service before it was ever hooked up. They came out to hook up internet not even knowing they didn't service my area, then when I cancelled the cable service because of that, it took me literally two whole days on hold talking to numerous people to get it done. Then they sent me a cable bill; another 100 min. on hold to get that cleared up. No customer service!!!"
"jehan of San Francisco , CA","Jan. 4, 2016",1,"Have business account with Comcast and I always check on my expiration day. They always say on the end of this year 12/31/2015. When I tried to close my account they said ""oh your account will be end up on 03/30/2016."" I told them ""What do you mean? We agree on one year, not more than one year."" They said ""oh you change it."" I am like why should I change it while I am not using the service and add 3 months, that doesn't make no sense and they yell at me and they saying they won't close it. If I don't stay with them and pay they will destroy my credit. Is that how you guys keep the customer? That's ripoff and I won't let you abusing me or forcing me."
"D of N/A, WA","Jan. 3, 2016",1,"Comcast is too massed produced. Where's the competition? There's no extra companies to choose from. Price is right but with a lack of customer service. This is not easy if you have problems or need to talk to someone. In the near future I will probably switch to satellite. Overall I'm not impressed with them. I would rate them zero stars for service and 2.5 for customer service. Overall each customer service representative has been excellent with their customer service. Assuming you can understand half of their representatives. Half the time I end up requesting to be transferred to another.Their phone tree is a slough of mess to keep you from talking to their agents. I spent 40 minutes talking to the computer to just contact a customer service representative. Only to end up down the wrong tree and ended up calling back multiple times. Not to mention you can end up waiting on hold for many minutes. Which can vary call to call. I recently moved to a new address and the area I moved into isn't ""recognized"" on their map. We had to be transferred to multiple agents before someone found it. Even though the contract is terminated at the other location we keep getting bills for it. Even though it says that particular location was terminated in their system.I've tried their tivo product(s) and ended up getting screwed on the contract because it wasn't clearly explained to me. It didn't help the customer rep kept pushing me to have it when I didn't want it. Not to mention all the upgrades they were pushing. I wanted to terminate it on the second week of having it. The customer service rep pushed me to ""keep"" it. Even though I requested not to. I called back the next month when I noticed the charge kept going through to the credit card. The agent said I waited too long to terminate it. They kept pushing me to keep it even though I no longer had the unit. I asked the person to terminate it but they wouldn't let me. I called back next month after another charge went through against my will. They finally listened to me when I told them ""I will declare my credit card stolen if these unauthorized charges keep going through."" It didn't help that they kept trying to push horrendous fees to terminate it. I thank them for terminating it but six months of this b.s. was ridiculous. I for one will never do tivo again."
"amanda of Atlanta, GA","Jan. 3, 2016",1,"I have been a customer over ten years and this is my first review. When service works, it's great especially the Internet. But, when something doesn't work and you have to deal with people at Comcast, some people are nice, many are non English speakers who cannot understand the problem and add to the frustration, appointments are made and missed without offers to credit account (or if they do it's $20, what for a huge portion of my day gone?), rescheduling cannot happen for a week, etc. Technicians are generally pretty nice if not totally knowledgeable. I am sure if I paid my $500 monthly bill (two Internets, premium TV, voice) in this fashion and they had to nag me to do it on time and in full, it would not be acceptable. I understand service can go out, but if you make an appointment either keep it or kindly let me know you won't. Don't just stand me up. If someone asked me on a date and didn't show up or call or have a good reason, I would put that person to the curb. If you make a promise, keep it, and be polite to customers. Not too much to ask."
"noelle of Puyallup, WA","Jan. 2, 2016",1,"When I went to the fairgrounds in Puyallup WA I talked with Troy that signed me up for just a modem which I was just shopping around. I did not realize he signed me up. I also talked with Steven and we were comparing prices for $99 and $129.99 package. After talking with him I was like ""I don't need all the channels for the $129.99"" which was a $40 differences. When I signed up with Steven for $99 I was under the impression that DIY and GSN were included in that package, but it was not. It was in the $129.99 package which bumped me to the $129.99 package which I did not want. But in the long run it would be cheaper to stay where I am at.I got 5 bills even before I signed up with Comcast, I sign up on October 3, 15. The first bill I received was $65.93 for the modem which I talked with Larina on Oct 1, 2015 to say I don't have it and would give me a credit. I have the agreement I sign when I first join and sent it to Jon the supervisor on 10/30/15. He was supposed to call me and never did. Then I got another bill for $354.27 then they shut off my service saying it was past due. I have talked with 30+ people, 3 supervisor, 2 attorneys for Comcast and no one has called me back. And also, had 3 accounts now I only have one.Now I got email saying I owe $471.75 which is not true. I paid you guys off on Nov 20 for $67.04. Also, paid $77.04 on Nov 20 then paid on Nov 7 for $50.93 which the total is $194.99 total. This is not how you treat new customers and I will tell everyone I know not to go to Comcast. If I was not in 2-year contract I would cancel the whole thing. But I am not able to do that because I would get charge $230 early termination fee which I can't afford. I am on a budget and not made of money. Is there any way I can cancel and not be charged a $230 early termination fee?I would have stayed with DirecTV if I would have known it was going to be a nightmare. I went with Comcast because it was cheaper and I would get a $150 gift card. Micheal on November 25, 2015 from billing did a good job trying to get my account figure out. Now they sent me a check for $101.87 which was a credit for the old account that they cancel. Which should have been transfer to the new account, but it was not. Now, they are saying I need to pay that amount which is not true at all. This is the worst company ever. They don't have any customer service whatsoever. Even corporate cannot call you back or email you."
"william of Ladylake, FL","Jan. 1, 2016",1,"3 years ago, we moved to a new address and I went to the Comcast office to inform them of the move in conjunction with informing the electric company of same. Since that time we have lost our cable/internet services 4 times each because they say no one is living at the new address. Their voice auto system is terrible, taking up hours of time just to get to the part where you want to speak to an agent. Then it doesn't which agent you're speaking to, they pass you off to someone else, who then starts to ask the same opening questions, or they play the ""hello, hello, are you there?"" game.We just lost cable/internet yesterday due to the incorrect address, as comcast cancelled out services due to ""no one living there"". It took a face to face meeting of going down to the comcast office and speaking to rep and even then, even when she said she took care of everything, the modem she gave me didn't work. Phone tech said ""take it back it's no good.""Checking online and my address showing on the site is still our old address, when comcast asked if we were getting a new modem to activate, I said ""no"". Comcast's poor customer service resulted in our losing our cable/internet, so they are now trying to correct their faults. They have bad customer skills, poor troubleshooting skills, and are just terrible at admitting their mistakes. I wouldn't ever recommend anyone using comcast. Better to see what other options you have at your area."
"Scott of Newbury Park, CA","Dec. 31, 2015",1,"Comcast is blocking One America News from its lineup. One America News Is a more conservative, family owned news network. At only 10-11 cents per month to customers, this small, family owned news service provides commercial-free news which is often never covered by the major networks who are beholden to huge corporate interests such as events in Europe and domestic issues. Comcast does however provide Al Jazeera as a news network. Comcast's refusal to carry One America News is likely politically motivated, creating a broad censorship of alternative ideas to millions of customers. (I have no affiliation with any news network or cable provider.)"
"JT of Half Moon Bay, CA","Dec. 30, 2015",2,"During the 20 months that I have had Comcast/Xfinity there have been many times that I've called their tech support for the issue resolved. So, I looked at my phone records and see that since Nov 13, 2015, I have called or received issues. Most of the problems have been solved leaving only a few that an answer was never provided. Calls from their tech support 32 times, using 334 minutes of my phone time (at $0.29/min that comes to $96.28 in call time). In general I believe the tech support is well done, it's just that it is very annoying that there are so many calls necessary and that many of the issues are repeats."
"Samantha of Pompano Beach, FL","Dec. 30, 2015",1,"Technician that works in Broward County, Florida came to my house this morning to find a parked vehicle in the driveway. He pulled up next to my parked vehicle. I am looking at him while brushing my teeth through my bathroom window. He parks and remained seated in his air conditioned vehicle. He then pulls out his phone and appears to be making a phone call. He Sat there for about a 2 minutes. By the time I am finished brushing my teeth and I make it to the door, there was no Comcast vehicle in view. He was gone.I then called Comcast to find out what had happened. I was told that they would be more than happy to reschedule for Sunday, (today is Wednesday) and what had happened was that the technician came out, he called a phone number and got no one and so he left. I said to Comcast, but he did not even knock the door. They said the technician is not required to knock he can call and that if he does not reach someone he does not have to knock. Meanwhile, the phone number he called is my landline number from my old address that he is now required to activate at my new address. LOL. So once again, I am left without service for many more days. Because they were scheduled to come yesterday but never should up. I am wondering to myself if Comcast only screens their technicians for background but not for common sense. How about laziness?"
"John of White House, TN","Dec. 29, 2015",1,"I have had good service from Comcast. However, after the first bill I started receiving bills in excess of what I owed for a month. I have tried to contact them via the internet multiple times and when I am able to get onto their website either I can't contact or something else goes wrong. Most of the time I have to change my password all over again and have had to do that more than once in the same day because the system did not recognize my password. But my main problem is the billing. I have gone to the local office and also called them two or three times and once they said they fixed it, but it wasn't fixed. The last time they said they billed a month ahead and I still had a late fee because I had not paid the month ahead. I don't think any of them know what the .... they are doing. I hate to cut off the service but I am planning on doing so if this is not immediately resolved completely. This is apparently the only way to get through to them. They must ask on the applications for employment if a person is a moron and, if so, they hire them. These people are idiots!!!"
"Rasheeda of Philadelphia, PA","Dec. 29, 2015",1,"Who is the owner of this company? He should be prosecuted for robbing his customers!!! I have the Xfinity Double Play package in which is the Internet and Phone for $49.99 per month. Okay, so fast forward. I get my first bill and I see I'm being charged for a modem ($9.99). Okay so I call them after I get a new modem and asked for this charge to be taken off after I get my own modem. Well here we are 3 months later and I'm still being charged for services/product that I'm not using. I have to call them every month to try to get this off in which the customer rep always promise that it will be taken off but NEVER does. It's still on my bill. They are also charging me for $4.99 for an in home technical support. Hmmm I let them know I DON'T need it and yes they are still billing me for this. As soon as my 1 year contract is up... VERIZON here I come!!!"
"Manny of Miami, FL","Dec. 29, 2015",1,"Comcast/Xfinity is a complete and utter disaster. All calls are taken overseas. No managers or supervisors to speak with at all - this is non-existent. You will be quoted at one price and billed at another. Your equipment fees will increase gradually by the month with no warning at all. If you want to cancel the service or package you will be charge at $220.00 cancellation fee. Comcast and Xfinity is a complete joke and highway robbery. They don't give a damn about any of the customers. You're just a number, that's all."
"Craig of Cape Coral, FL","Dec. 29, 2015",1,"It is no wonder Comcast has such a terrible reputation. First person I spoke with was from the Philippines after spending over 15 grueling minutes on the phone as I had difficulty understanding the person who was trying to convince me the ""Regional Sports Fee"" was a state tax (which is B.S.). He said he would transfer me to someone who was fluent in English. The second person was even worse, I couldn't understand him at all. He transferred me to someone else, also with a foreign accent who finally transferred me to someone in Michigan who I could understand. That is 4 people I spoke with trying to get an answer.When I questioned the ""Broadcast TV Fee"" ($3.25 to $5.00, a 54% increase) and ""Regional Sports Fee"" ($4.25 to $8.00, a 88% increase) plus that I don't even like or listen to sports, but we have to pay a fee for something we don't use. She also tried to spin that it was a ""government fee"", more B.S. She then tried to explain it by saying Comcast costs are going up. Right. Please show me where Comcast costs are going up 54% or 88%. Perhaps increases in executive salaries and so-called athletesŠ—È salaries are increasing that much. One of the reasons I don't watch sports is the ridiculous incomes the industry demands.Comcast is lying to and ripping its customers off not only by forcing a fee on many people who don't use that particular service but increasing the fees by exorbitant amounts and lying about the increase when the consumer price index is only going up 0.5% while average American wages & salaries are at 20 year lows!!"
"Cynthia of Bayport, MN","Dec. 29, 2015",1,"The service has been bad and lots of technical issues, rude customer service, and in 1.5 months my bill is over 800.00 and it keeps rising yet nothing extra has been ordered on my account and no one can explain why my bill is so high.

"Brooke of Rockville, MD","Dec. 28, 2015",1,"I used to have Comcast and decided a year after switching to try to switch back. I have been through hell and back and except for one woman named Yvonne who claimed she knew what was needed to make this work, after LITERALLY 9 1/2 hours on the phone with COMCAST I got a call today from a woman named Marlene in Installation Review saying she cancelled my appointment; however, later today I got a phone call from the automated system confirming my install appointment. The customer service is beyond awful. In fact, it is incredible that they even have any customers. I am going to ensure my install and new comcast account are cancelled. I cannot work with them anymore. They don't seem to have more than one educated employee and there is no way to get back in touch with her. Literally call after call after call to get a silly issue resolved. Now they cancelled it again. This is not the first time but it is definitely the last. I totally agree with the guy that wrote a review that going to comcast was the worst decision of his adult life. They have no idea what they are doing and their systems do not talk to each other. Their staff have no accessibility and the woman Marlene has a voice mail on a recurring loop and if you are lucky you can leave a message but she doesn't call back. This is the worst run company known to mankind. I am tired of being inconvenienced by a bunch of inept morons."

I was charged over $70.00 for a home visit when the problem was an outside issue with my cable box not inside! I was told by an agent that the $70 dollars service charge would be removed. It never was and that led to so many other problems unrelated to this issue. You wait so long to speak with someone and each agent says that they will document but they don't. I am so ready to discontinue this terrible service that I pay so much for!
"Igor of Woodstock, GA","Dec. 28, 2015",1,"The whole thing about Comcast Xfinity is extremely dissatisfactory!! Anything we touch beginning with countless hours regarding billing to the 30% off the internet speed we are supposed to be getting is HORRIBLE experience.

"Brian of Secaucus , NJ","Dec. 25, 2015",1,"My Triple Play service was down when I came home from work on 12/23/15, because a tractor trailer came down my street and tore down the low hanging cable wire from the street to my house, that Comcast has promised to fix for 9 months but never did. Technician came out 12/24 to fix. Ran a new wire from pole to my house and connected. Came home from work and nothing working. Tech support said there was no signal coming from my cable box & modem. Called Comcast at 2 pm and they said nobody can come out till 12/27 to repair. Had no cable, internet, or phone on Christmas eve or Christmas day when I was home, because of their laziness. When they come out to fix it I'm going to refuse the service and cancel all of it. Then I will call DirecTV and just add more gb to my Verizon plan for internet service. This was the 3rd time this year a truck tore down my wire and they refused to fix it properly. Every time tech came out it was a ""temporary fix"". I'm so done with Comcast."
